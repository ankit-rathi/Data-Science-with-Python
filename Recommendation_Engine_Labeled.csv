No,Italian police crack down on fake Covid-19 vaccination passes,Underground trade conducted over Telegram,"Italian police have launched a crackdown on criminals who traffic fake Covid-19 vaccination ‘green pass’ certificates via Telegram messenger.The ‘NO-VAX FREE’ operation led to raids on premises linked to several suspected administrators of the Telegram channels in Veneto, Liguria, Apulia, and Sicily.The Guardia di Finanza (GdF), the Italian law enforcement agency responsible for dealing with financial crime, first detected the trade in mid-July, shortly before they called on technical assistance from Group-IB’s Amsterdam-based, hi-tech crime investigation department.Catch up on the latest cybercrime news and analysisGroup-IB analysts subsequently managed to confirm the existence of at least 35 Telegram channels offering for sale fake green passes, documents issued to vaccinated Italian citizens and those who recently tested negative or recovered from Covid-19.In follow-up research, Group-IB uncovered evidence that pointed towards the suspected perpetrators’ identities. Group-IB told The Daily Swig that the number of suspects identified is confidential because the police operation is ongoing. We're still waiting back on a response to other follow-up questions from the threat intelligence firm.Corrupt healthcare workers ruseThe cybercriminals behind the illicit trade in counterfeit passes promised prospective buyers “authentic Green Passes with QR codes”, credentials they supposedly obtained thanks to the complicity of corrupt healthcare sector workers.In reality, any passes on offer were completely fake and the whole operation was a scam.“We urge the Italians not to use these phony illegal services as they not only lose their money, but they submit their sensitive personal data to criminals and put themselves at a greater risk of follow-up scams,” said Colonel Gian Luca Berruti of the Guardia di Finanza, in a canned statement. “I thank Group-IB’s team for supporting the GdF investigation to unmask this criminal organization.”?According to Group-IB, fake passes typically sold for around €100, payable using cryptocurrency payments (Bitcoin or Ethereum), PayPal money transfer or voucher payments, like Amazon gift cards.To get a green pass, the potential customer was first asked to create a secret chat on Telegram with the seller.In several cases, this secret communication was deleted once buyers had paid with nothing offered in return. In other cases, only a fraudulent pass was offered.Ongoing operationDespite the crackdown, new channels peddling the same or similar fraudulent Covid-19 vaccination passes are likely to reappear. For this reason, The Guardia di Finanza operation remains ongoing.A Guardia di Finanza statement on its operation thus far can be found here (in Italiano). A video of raids associated with the investigation was released through YouTube.The scam has emerged in the country that was the epicentre of the first wave of coronavirus cases back in March 2020, and at a time of huge international concern about the spread of the Omicron variant of the virus that was first identified last week.RELATED Interpol arrests 1,000 suspects, seizes $27m in crackdown on cybercrime",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/italian-police-crack-down-on-fake-covid-19-vaccination-passes,"['Cybercrime', 'Coronavirus', 'Italy', 'Fraud', 'Social', 'Media', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Europe', 'Legal', 'Industry', 'News']"

no,New differential fuzzing tool reveals novel HTTP request smuggling techniques,White paper systematically examines the attack while showcasing a ‘laundry list’ of new flaws,"Researchers have released a new fuzzing tool used for finding novel HTTP request smuggling techniques.The tool, dubbed ‘T-Reqs’, was built by a team from Northeastern University, Boston, and Akamai.In a white paper (PDF) the researchers discuss how they discovered a wealth of new vulnerabilities using the fuzzing tool, which they said can be used by bug bounty hunters and researchers alike.HTTP historyHTTP request smuggling, which first emerged in 2005, interferes with how websites process sequences of HTTP requests received from users.Load balancers (aka reverse proxies) typically forward multiple HTTP requests, consecutively, to back-end servers over the same network connection.If there is a discrepancy between the front- and back-end servers, it can allow attackers to smuggle hidden requests through the proxy.This could have far-reaching consequences and lead to scenarios such as account hijacking and cache poisoning.Previous research into the exploit targeted the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers.READ MORE Black Hat 2020: New HTTP request smuggling variants levied against modern web serversThis new research instead focusses on HTTP request smuggling (HRS) as a system interaction problem involving at least two HTTP processors on the traffic path.The paper reads: “These processors may not necessarily be individually buggy; but when used together, they disagree on the parsing or semantics of a given HTTP request, which leads to a vulnerability.“This key aspect of HRS has not been explored in previous work. Next, previous attacks focus on malicious manipulation of the two aforementioned HTTP headers.“Whether the remaining HTTP headers, or the rest of an HTTP request, could be tampered with to induce similar processing discrepancies remains uncharted territory.”Tool for successT-Reqs, which is shorthand for ‘two requests’, is a grammar-based HTTP fuzzer that generates HTTP requests and applies mutations to them to trigger potential server processing quirks.It exercises two target servers with the same mutated request, and compares the responses to identify discrepancies that lead to smuggling attacks.BACKGROUND HTTP request smuggling: HTTP/2 opens a new attack tunnelSpeaking to The Daily Swig, Akamai’s Kaan Onarlioglu said: “T-Reqs is a fuzzer that exercises server pairs in an experimental setup.“It is a tool that discovers novel smuggling vulnerabilities. This is particularly useful for server developers, and in fact several vendors mentioned in our paper are now using it for their internal testing.“T-Reqs is not designed to test live web applications; it is not a penetration testing tool that repeats previously known smuggling payloads. Burp Suite’s HTTP Request Smuggler extension is a much better fit for that.“We envision that the community will enhance and use T-Reqs to find new vulnerabilities, and then integrate these payloads with their testing tools and processes.”Read more of the latest security research newsOnarlioglu said that they decided to explore the topic because the HTTP specification is extremely complex, so the team figured there was a “plethora of server technologies out there with their quirks”, and “there must be unfathomed opportunities to smuggle requests”.The researcher said: “Our research tested this hypothesis. We systematically explored all parts of an HTTP request together with the pairwise combinations of 10 popular proxy/server technologies. We found a laundry list of brand new vulnerabilities!”The white paper contains more information on the vulnerabilities as well as more technical details.System centricOnarlioglu told The Daily Swig: “The fascinating thing about request smuggling is that it is a system problem. Even if we could come up with a magic development process and start cranking out flawless servers, they would still fail spectacularly in the face of request smuggling.“Secure components do not necessarily make a secure system; security is an emergent property of the system as a whole.“Researchers did not traditionally view security from this lens, but that is changing with recently popularized attacks like smuggling, cache poisoning, and cache deception.“My team strongly believes that a systems-centric view is key to thwarting the next generation of web attacks, and therefore we are actively studying this domain.”RECOMMENDED Research has come a long way, but gaps remain – security researcher Artur Janc on the state of XS-Leaks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/new-differential-fuzzing-tool-reveals-novel-http-request-smuggling-techniques,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security']"

These apps are often covert, meaning victims have no knowledge of malware being on their device.The report from Kaspersky found that globally, UK respondents were the highest number of people who feel justified in digitally stalking their partner online if they felt they were being unfaithful – 76% said this was reasonable behavior, compared to the international average of 64%.Furthermore, data also found that people in Britain are more likely to feel justified in stalking their partner (11%) without their knowledge.Read more of the latest surveillance newsThe same percentage of UK adults say they have been forced to install stalkerware apps on their smartphone by a partner – the joint-highest score in Europe, along with the Czech Republic.Respondents from the Czech Republic gave the highest reported rate of domestic abuse in Europe, with 29% of those surveyed saying they have experienced emotional or physical violence from their partner.Nearly 30% of surveyed UK adults have also experienced violence or abuse committed by their partner, while the European average is 21%.Rising numbersThe use of stalkerware has increased in recent years, with 8% of UK adults admitting their partner had become more controlling during the pandemic alone.Nearly a fifth (24%) of surveyed UK adults said they worry about their partner violating their privacy, with more than half (54%) worrying a privacy violation will be carried out through the monitoring of their text messages.DON’T MISS Zero tolerance: How infosec’s online ‘cancel culture’ is stunting industry growthKaspersky did note that more than half (51%) know the password on their partner’s phone, “showing that a discrepancy between concern and behavior”.A further investigation into the types of tech being used found that that 15% of UK respondents had been digitally stalked. In 44% of those cases, apps on the victim’s smartphone were used.Other means of stalking victims identified by Kaspersky include tracking devices (28%) webcams (23%), laptop apps (22%), and smart home devices (15%).‘Huge concern’Notorious spying apps such as NSO Group’s Pegasus software – used by nation states to monitor adversaries – have made headlines in recent years.Perpetrators don’t have to have access to expensive apps to carry out cyberstalking, however, with a range of apps readily available online.Even applications such as Apple’s Find My iPhone, used to locate a missing device, can be abused.During a webinar held by Kaspersky to discuss the findings, David Emm told The Daily Swig that this indicates that “the problem goes beyond more than just purpose-built stalkerware apps”.“It includes find my device, shared passwords, exploiting the fact that the device is shared with someone else, checking someone’s browser history on a desktop or laptop…” Emm said.He added: “The growth in stalkerware poses a huge concern – and we fear that these latest, worrying figures are just the tip of the iceberg.“Stalkerware typically runs in the background without the affected individual noticing. To avoid the risk of someone installing stalkerware on your phone, it’s always important to use a complex lock screen password and avoid leaving the device unlocked.”JusticeThe conviction rate for cyberstalking varies globally, in part due to the different legal definitions of the crime.Earlier this week (November 22), a US man was sentenced to 15 years in prison and a $164,000 restitution fine for cyberstalking and sextortion offenses.Over a seven-year period, Christopher Buonocore, 35, from Hicksville, New York, used fictitious phone numbers, text messages, and social media accounts to harass, intimidate, cyberstalk, and attempt to sextort six women, including a minor, the Department of Justice stated.The harassment campaign involved posting thousands of sexually explicit and nude images of the victims to the internet, as well as the victims’ personal identifying information, including phone numbers, addresses, and social media account identifiers.FBI Tampa Division special agent in charge Michael McPherson said: “The FBI urges any victim of online threats to report the crime. We have the resources and the commitment to investigate these cowardly acts.”RECOMMENDED Research has come a long way, but gaps remain – security researcher Artur Janc on the state of XS-Leaks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cyberstalking-study-uk-residents-most-accepting-of-spyware-to-track-partners-movements,"['Surveillance', 'Spyware', 'Privacy', 'Europe', 'Cybercrime', 'UK', 'Malware', 'Research', 'Social', 'Media', 'Passwords', 'Coronavirus', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'US', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Mobile', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Legal', 'Industry', 'News', 'Apple', 'North', 'America']"

Yes,Microsoft unveils ‘Super Duper Secure Mode’ in latest version of Edge,Browser goes further to protect against bugs by disabling JIT,"Microsoft has unveiled a ‘Super Duper Secure Mode’ in the latest version of Edge browser, offering users greater protection against common vulnerabilities.The feature was first mentioned back in August, in a blog post by Edge’s vulnerability research lead, Johnathan Norman.Norman revealed on Twitter last night (November 22) that the feature has been rolled out “secretly” in the latest version, 96.0.1054.29.Read more of the latest browser security newsSuper Duper Secure Mode – also known as SDSM – helps to mitigate against browser attacks by disabling the Just-In-Time component in V8, a technology linked a large number of security vulnerabilities in recent years.V8 is an open source JavaScript engine which was developed by the Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browser (the code base for recent versions of Edge).JavaScript engines are “a remarkably difficult security challenge for browsers”, explained Norman, partly due to the use of the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, also known as speculative optimization.This technology enables engines to convert JavaScript into machine code just before it is executed, resulting in huge gains in speed and usability, but losses for security.JIT engines are commonly found to be vulnerable to security bugs, though Norman says that developers are willing to accept this cost because users want their browsers to be “fast”.JIT do itIn order to defend against the plethora of bugs bundled with JIT, Super Duper Secure Mode disables the engine, removing “roughly half” of the issues present.Norman also noted that performance times are not significantly affected by disabling the engine, for example tests that measured improvements in power showed a 15% improvement on average. Regressions showed an 11% increase in power consumption.Page load times, however, showed regressions [negative performance drops] averaging around 17%.The SDSM feature also enables users to toggle between Balanced and Strict modes, giving them greater control over what is and isn’t enabled.“Balanced learns what sites you use often and trusts those, strict is well… strict,” Norman tweeted, adding that Edge users can also add their own exceptions.JITstreamNorman noted that there are benefits beyond attack surface reduction – due to how the V8 JIT works, several impactful mitigation technologies do not work during the rendering process.With JIT disabled, these technologies can also be utilized – for example Controlflow-Enforcement Technology (CET), a new hardware-based exploit mitigation from Intel, and Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG), which cannot be used with JIT engines.“By disabling JIT, we can enable both mitigations and make exploitation of security bugs in any renderer process component more difficult,” wrote Norman.More information on other features bundled with the latest version of Edge is available in the release notes.RELATED Security researcher Artur Janc on the state of XS-Leaks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/microsoft-unveils-super-duper-secure-mode-in-latest-version-of-edge,"['Browsers', 'Microsoft', 'Edge', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DevSecOps', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software']"
no,"Research has come a long way, but gaps remain – security researcher Artur Janc on the state of XS-Leaks","‘By focusing on XS-Leaks as a fundamental vulnerability class, we help raise their profile and make it easier for developers to understand their impact’","Cross-site leaks (XS-Leak) are a family of browser-side channels that can be used to infer information about users. Web developers and browser vendors often misunderstand XS-Leak bugs, which can have security and privacy implications for their applications and users.In an upcoming talk (PDF) at the XS-Leaks Summit, security researcher Artur Janc aims to shed light on some of these misunderstandings. Janc has been working on XS-Leaks for over a decade and has helped document and fix many security issues in web applications and browsers.In a Q&A with The Daily Swig, Janc shared his perspective on XS-Leaks and what needs to be done.What is your background and experience in XS-Leak?I’ve worked on the security of this area for over a decade, since before this type of issue got the name of “XS-Leaks”. This included research on websites’ ability to reveal users’ web browsing histories (PDF) or evaluating how new web APIs, such as the Ambient Light Sensor, could be abused to learn information about a user’s browsing history, and working with web browser vendors to address these issues.At Google, security engineers on our Information Security Engineering team conduct novel research and follow community developments in this area, with the goal of protecting our applications and the web at large.Part of my work included reviewing the landscape of cross-origin information leaks (PDF) and working with engineers on our team to launch the xsleaks.dev wiki which is arguably the most comprehensive resource enumerating known XS-Leaks attacks and defenses.How do you see the evolution of research and mitigation of XS-Leaks in the past few years?Web browsers have done a good job at giving developers “native” web defenses to protect their applications: Fetch Metadata headers, Cross-Origin Opener Policy, Cross-Origin Resource Policy, SameSite cookies, and others (further information here and here).RELATED What is Fetch Metadata? How to protect your web resources from information-stealing attacksThey have also shipped certain kinds of XS-Leak protections by default: SameSite=Lax-by-default cookies, Site Isolation (spearheaded by Chrome but now also on the verge of being available in Firefox), and other features that lock down attack vectors that have historically allowed XS-Leaks to occur.These are all major positive developments for the web because they protect sites from some XS-Leak attack vectors by default and allow developers of particularly sensitive sites to adopt additional opt-in protections for their applications. However, as always in security, there are still gaps that allow attacks which we continue to evaluate and mitigate.Cross-site leaks attacks can be used to infer information about users onlineAre there any aspects that you think have been overlooked or ignored by developers and browser vendors? Do you see any recurring patterns in XS-Leak vulnerabilities?With the positive developments mentioned above, the next class of issues that I’d point to as the next “frontier” for XS-Leaks (and for web security in general) are issues in browsers themselves that allow websites to leak some information about the user or their activity on other sites. The :visited history disclosure issue (PDF) is one example, but there are more, for example connection pool exhaustion and other network-level leaks.Read more of the latest browser security newsThese attacks can’t be mitigated by application developers by deploying mechanisms such as Fetch Metadata, CORP or COOP, and they require browsers (and sometimes OS vendors) to make far-reaching changes. Because these issues have long been part of the web platform, browsers may sometimes not perceive them as urgent; the goal of my talk is to remind browser vendors of the impact of :visited history detection and help them prioritize work on fixing them.Do you think XS-Leaks is an underrated threat, not receiving the attention it deserves(perhaps like XSS)?One way that I’d like developers and the security community to consider (and that I argued for in past talks) is that there are only three fundamental classes of security problems on the web: the lack of encryption (issues due to the use of plain HTTP, non-Secure cookies, etc.), injections (XSS), and the lack of isolation between web applications (leading to XS-Leaks, but also other well-known vulnerability classes such as CSRF, XSSI, or clickjacking).In that sense, XS-Leaks haven’t been underrated, we’ve just considered them to be multiple different vulnerability classes instead of one major problem. By focusing on XS-Leaks as a fundamental vulnerability class (rather than talk about XS-Search, CSRF, and other bugs separately) we help raise their profile and make it easier for web application developers and browser vendors to understand their impact and ways to address them.What is the goal of your talk? What do you wish to raise awareness of?As I already alluded to above, I’d like to help point web browser vendors’ attention to the problem of browsing history disclosure using the CSS :visited selector and help them prioritize fixes to improve the overall security/privacy posture of the web platform.RECOMMENDED Slack contains an XS-Leak vulnerability that de-anonymizes users",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/research-has-come-a-long-way-but-gaps-remain-security-researcher-artur-janc-on-the-state-of-xs-leaks,"['XS-Leak', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Analysis', 'Side-channel', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Browsers', 'API', 'Google', 'Privacy', 'Mozilla', 'Surveillance', 'Data', 'Leak']"

These passwords have been reset.For a subset of active customers, the SSL private key was exposed. GoDaddy is in the process of issuing and installing new certificates.Fresh phishFollowing news of the breach, website administrators were warned that miscreants may seek to abuse the leaked credentials to construct convincing phishing attacks designed to trick recipients into handing over even more sensitive information.Independent security experts advised that the deployment of multi-factor authentication to WordPress environments – best practice in normal circumstances – would be particularly helpful to GoDaddy customers in the aftermath of this breach.Ed Williams, director of Trustwave’s SpiderLabs research division, commented: “Enterprises, SMBs, and individuals using frequently targeted platforms like WordPress should ensure they are following strong password best practices: complexity, frequent password changes, not sharing passwords between applications, and multi-factor authentication.“If possible, utilize an authenticator app to secure your account instead of traditional two-factor authentication via SMS – as hackers have recently been targeting users with specialized SMS phishing,” Williams added.RELATED SIM swap fraud – an explainerOther third party security vendors noted that this isn’t the first time GoDaddy has suffered a security incident.Matt Sanders, director of security at LogRhythm, said: “Unfortunately, this incident is the fourth time in the last few years GoDaddy has suffered a data breach or cyber-attack.“This month’s data breach follows the hacking of a cryptocurrency domain managed by GoDaddy last November, an unauthorized user who breached 28,000 accounts last May, and an AWS error that exposed GoDaddy server data in 2018.“When an organization experiences a cyber-attack, it can signal a lack of proper security controls and policies, making the organization an even more appealing target for cybercriminals,” Sanders concluded.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Wind turbine giant Vestas confirms data breach following ‘cybersecurity incident’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/godaddy-managed-wordpress-hosting-service-breach-exposed-1-2m-user-profiles,"['Data', 'Breach', 'WordPress', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Phishing', 'Industry', 'News', 'Passwords', 'Authentication', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Organizations', 'Privacy', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Cybercrime', 'Social', 'Engineering', '2FA', 'Encryption']"

no,NUCLEUS:13 – Host of vulnerabilities shatter Nucelus TCP/IP stack defenses,Worst security flaw can lead to remote code execution,"Researchers have disclosed 13 vulnerabilities in the Nucleus TCP/IP stack, the worst of which can be used to remotely execute code.On November 9, Forescout Research Labs said the set of security flaws, collectively named NUCLEUS:13, were found with the assistance of Medigate Labs in Nucleus NET, the TCP/IP stack of the Nucleus Real-time Operating System (RTOS).Nucleus, developed by ATI 28 years ago and now managed by Siemens, is an OS for embedded devices that are considered ‘safety-critical’ in industries including manufacturing, the industrial sector, and healthcare.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsIn an advisory, the cybersecurity team said a total of 13 vulnerabilities have been found, ranging in severity from CVSS 5.3 to 9.8.The most severe vulnerability is CVE-2021-31886, a CVSS 9.8 buffer overflow flaw.This is caused by the Nucleus FTP server failing to properly validate the length of the “User” command, meaning that if an authentication request is sent with a very large username –whether it is valid or not – this can be exploited to trigger denial-of-service or to perform a remote code execution (RCE) attack.Four other vulnerabilities also achieved high severity scores: CVE-2021-31346 (CVSS 8.2), an unchecked ICMP payload issue prompting data leaks and denial-of-service conditions; CVE-2021-31884 (CVSS 8.8), an out-of-bound read/write bug caused by errors in hostname definitions, and both CVE-2021-31887 and CVE-2021-31888 (CVSS 8.8), two FTP server validation command problems which could be used to trigger denial-of-service and RCE.YOU MAY LIKE CKEditor vulnerabilities pose XSS threat to Drupal and other downstream applicationsIn addition, eight further vulnerabilities, considered less severe, were disclosed:CVE-2021-31344 (CVSS 5.3): ICMP echo packets with fake IP options can be sent to hostsCVE-2021-31345 (CVSS 7.5): Unchecked UDP payloads can lead to information leaks, denial-of-serviceCVE-2021-31881 (CVSS 7.1): Length validation failures in the DHCP client, leading to denial-of-serviceCVE-2021-31882 (CVSS 6.5): Length validation failures in DHCP ACK packets, causing denial-of-serviceCVE-2021-31883 (CVSS 7.1): Length validation failures in DHCP vendor options, also leading to denial-of-serviceCVE-2021-31885 (CVSS 7.5): Malformed TFTP commands could be sent to read the TFTP memory bufferCVE-2021-31889 (CVSS 7.5): Information leaks, denial-of-service caused by malformed TCP packets with corrupted SACK optionsCVE-021-31890 (CVSS 7.5): Unchecked TCP payload lengths causing data leaks, denial-of-serviceImplicationsAssessing the real-world impact is difficult, but when Shodan was first queried on August 5, over 2,200 vulnerable FTP and RTOS instances were found.“Real-world exploitation is easy to achieve for denials of service and harder for remote code execution because it depends on specifics of each device,” Forescout told The Daily Swig.“This is true for NUCLEUS:13 [...] but in both cases (DoS and RCE), exploitation in-the-wild has to bring a financial advantage to the attackers, since few incidents nowadays are not financially motivated.”Forescout has published a list of advisories related to vendors who may be impacted by NUCLEUS:13 on GitHub.Patch nowSiemens has developed patches to resolve the vulnerabilities and device vendors are expected to release their own updates. Some of the bugs were resolved in earlier stack versions.The researchers recommend that updates be applied to vulnerable software versions once they are available.Forescout told us that at the time of writing, 1,001 devices on Shodan still contain the FTP fingerprint and 1,230 contain the OS fingerprint, changes of -168 and +140, respectively, or a total of -28.As patching embedded devices can be “notoriously difficult due to their mission-critical nature”, the team has also provided exploit mitigation recommendations including the use of the Project Memoria script to detect devices running Nucleus; the enforcement of segmentation controls, and the recommendation that network traffic is monitored for suspicious behavior.RECOMMENDED Researcher finds SSRF bug in internal Google Cloud project, nabs $10,000 bounty",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nucleus-13-host-of-vulnerabilities-shatter-nucelus-tcp-ip-stack-defenses,"['Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Healthcare']"
no,"Researcher finds SSRF bug in internal Google Cloud project, nabs $10,000 bounty",Now-patched API vulnerability allowed attacker to access sensitive resources,"A URL parsing bug left an internal Google Cloud project open to server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, security researcher David Schütz has found.Now fixed, the bug, which Schütz has documented in a comprehensive video and blog post, could have allowed an attacker to access sensitive resources and possibly run malicious code.Leaking access tokenSchütz found the bug while doing research on Discovery Documents, data structures that provide specifications for Google API services. While exploring the Discovery Documents, Schütz stumbled on an interesting service called Jobs API, whose name suggested it was an internal service.The Jobs API led him to an application on the Google App Engine that served as a proxy to make the API available through Google’s public product marketing pages. The proxy served as an intermediary that provided access to the API, which meant it had an access token that could potentially serve as a window for SSRF attacks.The proxy prevented access to internal Google resources by running request URLs through a whitelist. But with a little fiddling, Schütz was able to trick the URL parser and bypass the whitelist to send requests to arbitrary servers. This enabled him to send requests from the proxy app to a VPS server he ran on Google Cloud.The request exposed the proxy app’s access token, which he could then use to send requests to other internal Google Cloud projects.“In this particular bug, the core issue was a URL parsing bug, which lead to the SSRF,” Schütz told The Daily Swig.Last year, Schütz had found a similar bug in a Google JavaScript library that was used in many Google services.Accessing resources, running arbitrary codeThrough the access token, Schütz was able to obtain a list of accessible internal projects, cloud storage buckets, virtual machines, and the administration interface of the proxy application.Through the latter, he was able to access logs that had sensitive user information (though he did not download any of the logs) and instances of the app itself, which could be reverse-engineered to obtain its source code.Read more of the latest cloud security newsThe administrative interface is especially dangerous because it has full control of the App Engine instance, allowing an attacker to disrupt the service, collect user information, or upload malicious code.To show the impact of the bug, Schütz created and uploaded a Python application on the proxy service that returned a base64 message. To avoid disrupting the main service, he uploaded the application as a non-default version of the proxy service.“This issue feels like an industry-wide problem since different applications are parsing URLs based on different specifications,” Schütz said.“After disclosing the initial issue in the Google JS library, I have already seen this getting fixed in products from different companies as well. Even though, this issue still keeps popping up even at Google. This SSRF is a great example of it.”Schütz was rewarded a $4,133 bounty by the Google Vulnerability Rewards Program for the discovery.After the bug was fixed, he had another shot at the proxy and saw that although the original exploit no longer worked, the URL parser could still be bypassed through another scheme. Reporting this new bug got him another $3,133 in double bounty.He later got a further $3,133 by discovering and reporting that old versions of the proxy application were still up and running.RELATED ‘Add yourself as super admin’ – Researcher details easy-to-exploit bug that exposed GSuite accounts to full takeover",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researcher-finds-ssrf-bug-in-internal-google-cloud-project-nabs-10-000-bounty,"['Google', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'API', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'VDP', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'SSRF', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Python', 'JavaScript']"
no,CKEditor vulnerabilities pose XSS threat to Drupal and other downstream applications,Attackers could bypass content sanitization with malformed HTML,"UPDATED Drupal, the widely used web content management system (CMS), has released security updates due to vulnerabilities in CKEditor, a third-party rich text editor bundled with Drupal.A pair of cross-site scripting (XSS) bugs, which are deemed ‘moderately critical’ by Drupal, could have a far-reaching impact since CKEditor is incorporated into numerous online applications.Downloaded more than 30 million times, the open source WYSIWYG editor is used by Microsoft, Siemens, Volvo, Disney, Deloitte, and countless other organizations.Drupal itself, which powers more than one million websites, has a huge install base.“Both vulnerabilities were discovered in the core package of the CKEditor 4 and are affecting all earlier versions of the editor,” CKEditor 4 project leader Jacek Bogda?ski tells The Daily Swig. Malformed HTMLThe XSS vulnerabilities could enable attackers to “inject malformed HTML bypassing content sanitization, which could result in executing JavaScript code”, says CKSource in the relevant advisories.They were found in the core HTML processing module by developer William Bowling and in the advanced content filter module by security researcher Maurice Dauer.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsDrupal says its users are vulnerable to the flaws if the CMS is configured to allow use of the CKEditor library for WYSIWYG editing.“An attacker that can create or edit content (even without access to CKEditor themselves) may be able to exploit one or more [of the bugs] to target users with access to the WYSIWYG CKEditor, including site admins with privileged access,” reads a security advisory published by Drupal on November 17.The threat level is such that the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) saw fit to issue a warning about the importance of applying updates.However, although the number of potentially vulnerable systems is significant, the attack “requires tricking a potential victim to copy and paste malicious HTML from the external source to the editor”, says Bogda?ski.He also emphasizes that the vulnerability is only present when affected versions are used by the user, and is unrelated to content produced by CKEditor.“Nevertheless, we recommend upgrading the editor as soon as possible,” he adds.CKEditor, Drupal updatesCKSource addressed the flaws with the release of version 4.17.0, as well as a hotfix, on November 17. All prior versions are vulnerable.Mindful of their responsibility given CKEditor’s use “by millions of users worldwide”, Bogda?ski says CKSource has “designed a completely new architecture in CKEditor 5 to reduce the chances of having XSS issues”, but in the meantime will strive “to keep CKEditor 4 secure at least until 2023”.Users of Drupal 9.2 are advised to update to Drupal 9.2.9, users of Drupal 9.1 should update to Drupal 9.1.14, and users of Drupal 8.9 should update to Drupal 8.9.20.The update represents the final security release for Drupal 8, which joins versions older than 9.1.x in having reached its end of life.Users should upgrade to Drupal 8 “and, as quickly as possible, upgrade to Drupal 9”, Greg Knaddison, volunteer member of the Drupal security team and senior director of information systems at the Morris Animal Foundation, tells The Daily Swig. “It’s a very straightforward process due to the way we managed deprecation and backwards compatibility in this release cycle.”Although Drupal 7 does not include the CKEditor module, continues Knaddison, it “can be affected if the site uses the CKEditor via a contributed module. The Security Team does not do advisories for modules where the site admin has to download library code (like CKEditor) as part of the installation,” he adds, citing a recent policy.Both Knaddison and Bogda?ski thanked the researchers who uncovered the vulnerabilities. Knaddison also commended Bogda?ski for keeping the Drupal team “updated throughout the process with respect to timing and the hotfix so we could be well prepared”. Bogda?ski praised the numerous security researchers who have disclosed vulnerabilities over the years, all of whom did so responsibly. “That’s the beauty of open source,” he says. “By letting everyone access your source code, one increases the chances of finding your weaknesses, but at the same time it makes your software better each time.”This article was updated on November 19 with comments from Greg Knaddison of the Drupal security team, and on November 24 with comments from CKSourceRELATED Server-side vulnerabilities in Concrete CMS put thousands of websites under threat",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ckeditor-vulnerabilities-pose-xss-threat-to-drupal-and-other-downstream-applications,"['Drupal', 'Vulnerabilities', 'XSS', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'JavaScript', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'OpSec', 'Privacy', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Industry', 'News', 'Microsoft']"
No,Iranian hackers charged with cybercrimes in connection with attempts to influence 2020 US Presidential Election,Pair were affiliated with group that tried to secure a win for Donald Trump,"Two Iranian nationals have been charged in connection with a disinformation campaign intended to threaten the integrity of the 2020 US Presidential election.A statement released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) yesterday (November 18) stated that the men were charged for their involvement in “a cyber-enabled campaign to intimidate and influence American voters, and otherwise undermine voter confidence and sow discord”.Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi (??? ???? ???? ???? ?????), also known as Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazem and Hosein Zamani, 24, and Sajjad Kashian (???? ??????), also known as Kiarash Nabavi, 27, are described as computer hackers who worked as contractors for an Iran-based company formerly known as Eeleyanet Gostar, and now known as Emennet Pasargad.Eeleyanet Gostar purported to provide cybersecurity services within Iran with customers including the Iranian government, the statement alleges.AccusationsThe defendants are accused of obtaining confidential US voter information from at least one state election website; sending threatening email messages to intimidate and interfere with voters; and creating and disseminating a video containing disinformation about purported election infrastructure vulnerabilities.The pair are also accused of attempting to access several US states’ voting-related websites, and successfully gaining unauthorized access to a US media company’s computer network that could have enabled them to disseminate false claims after the election.US attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New Yorks commented: “Working with others, Kazemi and Kashian accessed voter information from at least one state’s voter database, threatened US voters via email, and even disseminated a fictitious video that purported to depict actors fabricating overseas ballots.”BACKGROUND Spoiling the ballot: Cyber issues cast cloud over US presidential electionThe accused are alleged to have been part of a group that led the disinformation campaign between August and November 2020.Members of the group reportedly attempted to compromise approximately 11 state voter websites, including state voter registration websites and state voter information websites.Those efforts resulted in the successful exploitation of a misconfigured computer system of an unnamed US state and the resulting unauthorized downloading of information concerning more than 100,000 of this state’s voters.Read more of the latest cybercrime and security news from the USThe group also posed as far-right group ‘Proud Boys’ on Facebook and sent messages to officials associated with Donald Trump’s campaign and the media, claiming that the Democratic Party was planning to exploit “serious security vulnerabilities” in state voter registration websites to “edit mail-in ballots or even register non-existent voters”, the release reads.These messages were accompanied by a video carrying the Proud Boys logo, which purported to depict an individual hacking into state voter websites and using stolen voter information to create fraudulent absentee ballots through the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) for military and overseas voters.In October 2020, they posed as the Proud Boys to send threatening emails to tens of thousands of Democrat voters and threatened the recipients with physical injury if they did not change their party affiliation and vote for Trump.Finally on November 4, 2020, the day after President Joe Biden won the election, the conspirators sought to leverage details taken in earlier September and October 2020 intrusions into an unnamed US media company’s computer networks.However, because of an earlier FBI victim notification, the company mitigated the unauthorized access and these log-in attempts failed.ChargesKazemi and Kashian are both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of voter intimidation, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison; and one count of transmission of interstate threats, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.Kazemi is additionally charged with one count of unauthorized computer intrusion, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; and one count of computer fraud, namely, knowingly damaging a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.The Department of State’s Rewards for Justice Program is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on or about the Kazemi and Kashian’s activities.RECOMMENDED ‘Compromised credentials’ most likely vector in Trump re-election site defacement",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/iranian-hackers-charged-with-cybercrimes-in-connection-with-attempts-to-influence-2020-us-presidential-election,"['US', 'Election', 'Security', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Iran', 'Middle', 'East', 'North', 'America', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'Government', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Social', 'Media', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Database', 'Security', 'Legal']"
No,Tor Project unveils plans to route device traffic through Tor anonymity network with new VPN-like service,VPN+ tech detailed during annual ‘State of the Onion’ update,"The Tor Project is going beyond the browser with plans to develop VPN-like software in order to offer enhanced privacy safeguards.Tor VPN will initially be developed for Android, with a target delivery date in 2023, before porting to desktop platforms over an unspecified timescale. The development work will initially involve a collaboration between developers on the Tor Project and Guardian Project, which is known for Orbot, a proxy server that provides anonymity to users.“This isn’t just the simplest way we’ve found to talk about what will be an evolving project,” developer Matthew Finkel explained during the annual ‘State of the Onion’ livestream on Wednesday (November 17).“The web browser doesn’t meet everyone’s needs – especially on Android where apps provide a rich experience.”Expanded censorship circumventionsWhat’s aimed for is a development of Orbot and “perhaps a little more”, including the ability to route safe device traffic and/or specific application traffic through Tor.These developments will expand censorship circumventions to any application on a device.Finkel explained: “[This work] does not mean that we are developing a magical anonymizing filter-tunnel – don’t expect that this app will look at app traffic and remove identifying information.”BACKGROUND Tor security: Everything you need to know about the anonymity networkThe two-and-a-half-hour event also heard from developers working on the Tor Browser software and the associated anonymity network, as well as talks from developers of other privacy-enhancing technologies including SecureDrop and Ricochet.In July, with the release of Tor 10.5, developers integrated the tor daemon, bootstrapping it directly into the browser’s user interface.The upgrade from Tor Browser 10 to Tor Browser 11 involved updates to the base Firefox browser from 78-esr to 91-esr, a process that involved auditing Firefox patches to make sure they complied with Firefox privacy guarantees.During the course of 2021, developers also deprecated various v2 Onion Service sites. These v2 Onion Service Sites are no longer available in the recently released Tor Browser 11.State of the FutureThe previous 2020 edition of the State of the Onion focused on improvements to network speed and performance.Georg Koppen, network health lead on the Tor Project, said much of this work remains ongoing. “[Next year] we want to improve the overload situation and remove performance bottlenecks, for instance by using the SBWS bandwidth scanner and giving load back to under utilized relays from overloaded relays until the overload is gone,” Koppen explained.Catch up on the latest Tor-related news and anlysisWork on weeding out bad relays, the focus of new scanners and enhanced monitoring this year, also remains an ongoing battle.Behind the scenes, other Tor Project software developers are rewriting the Tor codebase in Rust. Arti, released as an alpha 0.0.1 release earlier this month, supports multithreading unlike the mainstream version of Tor written in C.The technology, whose development was funded by grants and donations, remains a prototype.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE New and improved Linux Random Number Generator ready for testing",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/tor-project-unveils-plans-to-route-device-traffic-through-tor-anonymity-network-with-new-vpn-like-service,"['Tor', 'Privacy', 'VPN', 'Network', 'Security', 'Censorship', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Industry', 'News', 'Android', 'Google', 'Surveillance', 'OpSec', 'Browsers']"
No,‘Everyone is welcome’ – Microsoft security panel offers different perspectives on vulnerability disclosure process,BlueHat is back following pandemic-induced hiatus,"Like so many events that fell victim to social distancing during the pandemic, Microsoft’s annual BlueHat conference was cancelled for both 2020 and 2021.This week the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) instead held a virtual panel event discussing vulnerability disclosure.Firstly, MSRC’s Jarek Stanley outlined the process, stressing that anybody was welcome to make a submission.“If it meets our bar, we start working with the relevant engineering group to start on a fix, to make sure the issue is understood and resolved,” he said. “Throughout that process the case manager will keep everyone involved up to date.”Read more of the latest news about bug bountiesBoth Boris Larin of Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team and Dr Nestori Syynimaa, senior principal security researcher at Secureworks, joined the panel, and said their experience of submitting bugs had been a positive one.However, warned Nestori, it’s important to be patient and describe issues clearly.“For instance, I am doing research mainly in ID and when we go to identify things they can be very difficult, and there might be in the world only five people who know about this,” he said.“So as a researcher, you need to be sometimes a little bit patient, and you need to write your report quite specifically with all the concepts, all the steps, so that you can verify that the bug really exists.”Two sides to every submissionAs an ex-MSRC staffer himself, Nate Warfield, chief technology officer at Prevailion, has worked on both sides of the fence, and said that a good relationship is key.“There are some researchers that can be less than friendly, more combative,” he said.“When you can get to know people, you can work through your differences before it becomes something that’s either being talked about on the news or causing a lot of headaches for people inside or outside the company.”But, added Nestori, it can sometimes worth being pushy.He said how his first bug bounty was rejected, with the reason being the fault was “by design”.“I asked a couple of times, ‘Could you take a look again, because it looks to me quite bad? The next email I got said OK we are considering a bounty, and I got $20,000 for that.”Future developmentsLarin said his own submissions in the past were treated seriously and fixed quickly but queried the clarity of Microsoft’s security boundaries.MSRC’s vice president Aanchal Gupta said: “Pretty soon you will see us publishing something. It won’t be perfect by any means, but with your feedback over time we will make improvements.”The panel members also discussed mitigation timelines, agreeing that the process could sometimes seem slow.Warfield concluded: “The cost of getting it right is beyond what most people understand. You’re talking about an ecosystem that’s measured in billions of desktops and servers, so if something goes wrong, the entire world is impacted.”DON’T MISS Clubhouse launches bug bounty program with $3,000 on offer for critical vulnerabilities",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/everyone-is-welcome-microsoft-security-panel-offers-different-perspectives-on-vulnerability-disclosure-process,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Microsoft', 'VDP', 'Events', 'Coronavirus', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations']"

Bug hunters could get $500 and $100, respectively, for valid ‘medium’ and ‘low’ severity bugs.In a blog post published to coincide with the program’s launch, Clubhouse said: “While many bug bounty programs promise high rewards for catastrophic-level discoveries, our approach keeps the scope broad so we can address as many bugs as possible. To that end, if you can help us fix bugs that could cause harm to our community, you’ll be eligible to earn a bounty.”Rapid riseClubhouse users can set up or join chatrooms to discuss all manner of topics with friends or strangers using their device’s mic – as opposed to via text, emoticons and visual memes, as has otherwise been the norm on social media.Catch up with more of the latest bug bounty newsLaunched in March 2020, Clubhouse enjoyed spectacular growth at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, with its cachet boosted by initially being invite-only and the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg using the platform.The app was downloaded more than 34 million times within a year of its launch, although its growth is since said to have slowed.In scopeThe Clubhouse bug bounty program has six assets in scope, including web domains clubhouse.com and joinclubhouse.com, backend API clubhouseapi.com, the Clubhouse iOS and Android applications, and the production and corporate infrastructure of Clubhouse developer, Alpha Exploration.The company is particularly keen on hardening its applications against security flaws leading to access control bypasses, escalation of permissions, and disclosure of sensitive user information.Its two other priorities are to bolster its infrastructure and internal “administrative tooling”.MORE HACKING NEWS Pwn2Own Austin 2021: Synacktiv crowned Masters of Pwn after Sonos One exploitClubhouse is aiming to triage vulnerabilities within two business days of notification, and to pay bounties within 14 business days.The app developer has already paid out more than $10,000 to ethical hackers within a few days of the program’s launch, with the highest bounty at the time of writing $9,850.“We’re excited to help support security for a platform like Clubhouse, which is already making waves through the conversations they’ve prompted within their current community,” said Michiel Prins, co-founder of HackerOne.“Clubhouse’s public bug bounty program will offer their in-house security team continuous testing support from a diverse pool of talent through our global community of more than one million hackers.”RELATED Bug Bounty Radar // The latest bug bounty programs for November 2021",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/clubhouse-launches-bug-bounty-program-with-3-000-on-offer-for-critical-vulnerabilities,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Social', 'Media', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Industry', 'News', 'Mobile', 'Privacy', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Authentication', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Coronavirus', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'API', 'VDP', 'Organizations', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Apple', 'Android']"
no,Secure development: New and improved Linux Random Number Generator ready for testing,Proposed replacement for /dev/random promises to double performance and add flexibility,"A modern alternative to the core encryption technology bundled with Linux distributions is ready for testing after five years of development.The Linux Random Number Generator (LRNG), which relies on several computing functions to act as a source of entropy, is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the long-established /dev/random function.The technology is designed to offer both API (application programming interface) and ABI (application binary interface) compatibility with its /dev/random predecessor, while offering several performance and utility advantages.LRNG offers a better doubling (130%) performance improvement on the /dev/random function.Only cryptographic primitives are used for data processing within the LRNG, which features a more modern and configurable design. The technology is built around an architecture that supports the testing of multiple facets of its operation by security researchers and others.Foundations showing their ageThe /dev/random is the “very foundation” of cryptography on Linux, developer Stephan Müller told The Daily Swig. “If /dev/random breaks, the entire cryptography on Linux is broken,” Müller said.Keeping with the existing approach is no longer sustainable, according to Müller.“Due to the new requirements vendors want to adhere to, every vendor is ‘cooking’ up his own patches to bypass or enhance the existing /dev/random. In my honest opinion, this is a very challenging situation.”Müller’s response to this has been to chart the development of next generation technology he recognizes will need comprehensive testing “a careful testing and assessment of new implementations is always required”.The current maintainer of the existing /dev/random is dead silent since beginning of my work. Other Linux developers including core developers have commented and those comments have been incorporated.That said, it is totally unclear whether or when the code will go into the mainline. By now publishing the LRNG news to other channels like the cryptography mailing list, I hope to bring the maintainer to react.Linux RNG: Sources of entropyAccording to Müller, LPRG incorporates four entropy sources that operate completely independent of each other including execution timing jitter and the timing of the arrival of interrupts.“Each entropy source operates with its own entropy rate and measurement,” Müller explained.Müller added: “The LRNG only uses cryptographic operations for data processing: either a DRNG [digital random number generator] or hash for data compression. The LRNG allows updating of the cryptographic algorithms.“The available cryptographic algorithms are all contemporary: SHA256 or SHA512 for conditioning, ChaCha20-DRNG, or SP800-90A DRBG. Yet, the LRNG offers a well-defined API allowing other cryptographic implementations to be defined.”A talk on LRNG was presented by Müller at the Linux Security Summit 2021 last month. The presentation is available on YouTube.Contemporary danceThe new technology will better support vendors in the world of open source development and beyond.“Lately, vendors using Linux have severe challenges to use the existing /dev/random?implementation as it is not meeting contemporary requirements,” Müller said. “The LRNG will meet all these requirements including giving the vendors flexibility to address their particular scenarios.”Müller went on to explain the origins of his work in developing the Linux Random Number Generator.“The idea for the LRNG design occurred during a study that I wrote for the? German BSI analyzing the behavior of entropy and the operation of entropy?collection in virtual environments,” he said.“In addition, another study [PDF] I wrote for BSI pushed me even more to developing the LRNG and bring it to production state.”Read more of the latest cryptographic security newsThe Linux Random Number Generator is actually a pseudo-random number generator derived from computing functions. Outputs from the generator are used to seed cryptographic algorithms and functions.Windows already takes a similar approach towards seeding and the sources of entropy.“MS entropy is derived from the likes of interrupt timing, TPM random string provided at boot, [and} Intel randomness function so it looks very much like the LRNG is following similar path,” Professor Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, told The Daily Swig.Issues with PRNGs are something of an Achilles’ heel in crypto system design.Professor Woodward explained: “There is much debate about what is truly random and how much it matters but the problem really comes about when the ‘random’ number is either predictable and/or reproducible.”ATMs, for example, use date stamp as a source of randomness – an input better described as unique rather than random.All this has spurred the development of hardware-based sources of randomness or (better yet) sources that derive their randomness from measurements of operations governed by quantum physics, such as Oxford University spin-out Quantum Dice.“One of the reasons hardware RNG haven’t really taken hold is because people have assumed what is there is good enough,” Prof Woodward concluded.RECOMMENDED ‘Add yourself as super admin’ – Researcher details easy-to-exploit bug that exposed GSuite accounts to full takeover",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/secure-development-new-and-improved-linux-random-number-generator-ready-for-testing,"['Encryption', 'Industry', 'News', 'Linux', 'API', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hardware']"
no,Vulnerabilities in NPM allowed threat actors to publish new version of any package,Details of flaws were made public this week,"GitHub security researchers have released details of two vulnerabilities they discovered in NPM, the Node.js package manager, one of which could allow a malicious actor to publish new versions of any package without proper authorization.In a blog post published on November 15, GitHub CISO Mike Hanley revealed that the first issue, which was discovered on October 26, allowed users to gain access to all private NPM packages created before October 20.This exposure was during routine maintenance of one of GitHub’s publicly available NPM services, Hanley explained.Read more of the latest security news about GitHubDuring maintenance on the database that powers the public NPM replica at replicate.npmjs.com, he wrote, records were created that could expose the names of private packages.“This briefly allowed consumers of replicate.npmjs.com to potentially identify the names of private packages due to records published in the public changes feed.“No other information, including the content of these private packages, was accessible at any time,” revealed Hanley.Affected package names were in the format of ‘@owner/package’ and were created prior to October 20. They were exposed between October 21 at around 13:00 UTC and October 29 15:00 UTC, the blog post explained.DON’T MISS GitHub changes policy to welcome security researchers“On October 29, all records containing private package names were removed from the replication database,” said Hanley, who noted that the data had also been “consumed by third-parties who may have replicated the data elsewhere”.To mitigate this issue from recurring during maintenance, Hanley said that GitHub has made changes “to ensure records containing private package names are not generated during this process”.Inconsistent authorization checksThe second and most pressing issue was a vulnerability that would allow an attacker to publish new versions of any NPM package using an account without proper authorization.It was reported to GitHub’s bug bounty program on November 2 and was patched within six hours, said Hanley.The vulnerability was present due to inconsistent authorization checks and validation of data across several microservices that handle requests to the NPM registry.Hanley explained: “In this architecture, the authorization service was properly validating user authorization to packages based on data passed in request URL paths.READ MORE ‘Focus on brilliance at the basics’ – GitHub CSO Mike Hanley on shifting left and securing the software supply chain“However, the service that performs underlying updates to the registry data determined which package to publish based on the contents of the uploaded package file.“This discrepancy provided an avenue by which requests to publish new versions of a package would be authorized for one package but would actually be performed for a different, and potentially unauthorized, package.”GitHub has found no evidence of in-the-wild exploitation – although Hanley admitted that the vulnerability predates the keeping of records, dating back to September 2020, that can provide such evidence.The issue has been fixed by ensuring consistency across both the publishing service and authorization service to ensure that the same package is being used for both authorization and publishing.Further improvementsIn the blog post, Hanley also said GitHub was “determined to continue to invest in the security of NPM and the broader software security supply chain”.Part of this commitment includes introducing automated malware detection and stronger authentication requirements for users “within the coming weeks”.RECOMMENDED Removing need to unlock mobile wallets for contactless payments has eroded security protections, researchers warn",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerabilities-in-npm-allowed-threat-actors-to-publish-new-version-of-any-package,"['Node.js', 'GitHub', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Industry', 'News', 'Authentication', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Database', 'Security', 'Research']"
no,Belarusian hackers claim to have accessed full database of those crossing the country’s borders,‘Belarus Cyber-Partisans’ say they gained access to all entries in and out of the country over the past 15 years,"As international tension ratchets up over Belarus’s authoritarian regime, a hacking group claims to have accessed the full database of those crossing the country’s borders, including the alleged movements of KGB officers and president Alexander Lukashenko himself.Belarus was plunged into crisis last year after the presidential election in August gave Lukashenko a landslide victory. As the opposition cried foul, massive protests broke out across the country, triggering thousands of arrests.Since then, a group of hackers called the Belarus Cyber-Partisans has carried out a series of attacks on government databases, with the aim of helping to destabilize the regime.The group is made up of a number of tech professionals, mostly believed to be based outside Belarus itself.RECOMMENDED Human rights activists condemn mass denial of service as Sudan’s nationwide internet shutdown enters second weekNow, in their latest hack, the Cyber-Partisans say they have gained access to records of all entries into, and exits out of, the country over the past 15 years, through all official border crossings.The data relates not only to Belarus citizens but also other nationals crossing the Belarusian border either by air, rail, road, or foot.“This data would enable us to identify fake passports issued for espionage purposes for KGB and other agents who pose risk to Belarusians in other countries,” a Cyber-Partisans spokesperson tells The Daily Swig.“Data also includes all the trips made by Lukashenko and his… close circle, and would help reveal illegal activities and put sanctions on them.”A sample of the purported Belarus border crossing datasetBorder patrolThe group’s previous leaks have proved instrumental in helping justify international sanctions against the regime.They included the entire police database, including CCTV footage and the employment history of officers, as well as the tapped phone calls of regime supporters and opponents.Also accessed were the personal details of every Belarusian citizen, including passport photos, home address, and place of work, along with the last 10 years of emergency calls history, including those made by people reporting their co-workers for opposing the regime.“We uncovered internal phone calls over which unlawful commands were dispatched to violently crack down on peaceful protests, and beat and torture the people,” the spokesperson says.Read more of the latest cyber warfare news and analysisThe group also believes that its actions have been acting as a deterrent to even greater human rights abuses by members of the regime.“The deanonymisation of the regime’s siloviki [strongmen] had variable effects; at first only a small fraction cared about their name being public,” the spokesperson says.“With time, as our information got more detailed – address, phone, photos, service history, spouses, etc – more and more of them got terrified of the consequences of those leaks. We had many of them contact us and ask us to remove them from the leaked list.”A YouTube video from the Cyber-Partisans account offers a glimpse into the purported border crossing dataset.Migrant crisisThe mounting migrant crisis at the Polish border is believed to be the result of a deliberate policy by Lukashenko, who was angered by earlier sanctions.There are already moves to broaden those sanctions, and Lukas Andriukaitis, associate director at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, believes that the information revealed by the hack could increase the pressure.“This will be quite a headache for the Belarusian KGB. Not only will their identities be revealed, which will require [them] to reshuffle some of the KGB agents, but also their potential crimes in Europe might be exposed,” he tells The Daily Swig.‘I think a lot will depend on [whether] any of the revealed names will be associated with operations in Europe, just like it happened with Bellingcat exposing Russian operatives in the West.“If any of the agents will be associated with crimes outside of Belarus, this might serve as an additional argument to sanction Belarus, which already is walking on thin ice due to the migrant crisis.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/belarusian-hackers-claim-to-have-accessed-full-database-of-those-crossing-the-countrys-borders,"['Hacking', 'News', 'Database', 'Security', 'Europe', 'Network', 'Security', 'Government', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Privacy', 'Surveillance', 'OSINT', 'OpSec', 'Russia', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Censorship', 'Election', 'Security', 'Encryption', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Poland']"
no,Exploit-as-a-service: Cybercriminals exploring potential of leasing out zero-day vulnerabilities,New approach echoes the depressingly successful ransomware-as-a-service business model,"Cybercriminals are starting to consider leasing our rather than just selling zero-day vulnerabilities under a potential ‘exploit-as-a-service’ model for the first time, according to threat intel firm Digital Shadows.This new approach would allow more capable threat actors to ‘rent out’ zero-day exploits to other cybercriminals to conduct cyber-attacks. This is similar to the ransomware-as-a-service affiliate model that has been adopted by some malware developers.Zero-day vulnerabilities are the most expensive flaws advertised on cybercrime forums and other grey-area vendor sites on the clear web.Digital Shadows has observed cybercriminals discussing zero-days prices reaching up to $10 million during its investigation into vulnerability sales through dark web forums. Another zero-day, another dollarGiven their often-critical potential impact, large profits can accrue from selling zero-day flaws – but it’s often a complex (and dangerous) business to negotiate a sale.The leasing model might enable zero-day developers to generate substantial earnings by renting the zero-day out while waiting for a definitive buyer, said Digital Shadows.Catch up on the latest dark web news and analysisRenting parties could test the proposed zero-day and later decide whether to purchase the exploit on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. But how could they ensure they remain the sole owners of any zero-day exploit?Digital Shadows told The Daily Swig that there are two options available to any exploit developer seeking to lease their proof of concept (PoC): first, they can obfuscate their code in such a way that it is undiscoverable by the purchaser; second, they could develop their exploit into a ‘click-and-shoot’ tool, similar to those developed by technology firms for use by government agencies.Both approaches pose challenges for exploit brokers, as Digital Shadows outlined:The first option may present increased profit margins for PoC developers. However, it would undoubtedly leave their code open to de-obfuscation by a sufficiently motivated and resourced purchaser.The second option would require significant additional time and resources in order to develop the infrastructure to turn a raw exploit into a tool that can be launched from a panel by the purchaser, under the control of the exploit developer. While less vulnerable to de-obfuscation, it may still be possible to reverse-engineer such a tool.Furthermore, this approach would almost certainly entail the developer having greater control and influence in the use of the exploit by the purchaser, and would rely on greater trust between the two parties.Many eyes make all bugs shallowThe exploit-as-a-service model may offer malicious hackers a new means of diversifying their revenue streams.However, the practice of leasing or renting out a zero-day exploit to numerous parties increases the risk of ‘burning’ a valuable asset.“Those who use the exploit against a high-profile target or a significant number of targets, would run the risk of the zero-day vulnerability (behind the exploit) being discovered,” Digital Shadows’ photon research team told The Daily Swig.“Threat actors discussing the exploit-as-a-service business model are well aware of these significant issues.”RECOMMENDED Removing need to unlock mobile wallets for contactless payments has eroded security protections, researchers warn“There is no consensus yet whether these obstacles may ever be overcome to the extent that the model becomes profitable for developers, who are primarily seeking to expand their revenue streams whilst waiting for an out-and-out buyer,” they added.If the business model proves viable, it would almost certainly increase the number of threat actors who can leverage sophisticated, and dangerous, zero-day vulnerabilities.Digital Shadows’ latest dark web study was published today (November 16) and is available online.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Laws and regulations need to change to secure world’s digital infrastructure",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/exploit-as-a-service-cybercriminals-exploring-potential-of-leasing-out-zero-day-vulnerabilities,"['Zero-day', 'Cybercrime', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Industry', 'News', 'Malware', 'Ransomware', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Government']"
no,Number of cyber-attacks infiltrating critical New Zealand networks soars,National cybersecurity agency also observes rise in automated probing for web security flaws,"New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has observed a 15% year-on-year jump in cyber-attacks against the country’s “nationally significant” organizations.More than 400 such incidents were recorded between July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, up from 352 a year earlier, according to the NCSC’s latest annual threat report, published today (November 16).More alarmingly still, the proportion of these incidents that reached the post-compromise stage – where threat actors manage to access and move laterally through networks or otherwise cause the victim harm – more than doubled, from 15% to 33%.RECOMMENDED Black Hat Europe: Laws and regulations need to change to secure world’s digital infrastructureThe other 67% of attacks failed to get past pre-compromise phases like network scanning, brute-forcing of credentials, and attempts to exploit vulnerable software.Ransomware and denial-of-service attacks, both rife in line with international trends, accounted for a significant share of post-compromise attacks against New Zealand-based targets.Outrunning the patching cycleThe most widely deployed attack technique was the identification via automated scanning and exploitation of security vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.Adversaries, noted the NCSC, were increasingly able to exploit software flaws faster than even the most security-conscious, well-resourced organizations could patch them – sometimes within a day or two of their public disclosure.By contrast, phishing is becoming a noticeably less effective means of infiltrating networks as organizations and their employees wise up to the threat, the agency observed.Rise of ransomwareThere was a near doubling in the proportion of attacks attributed to criminally or financially motivated – as opposed to state-sponsored – threat actors, observed the NCSC.The 110 incidents of this nature tracked in the latest reporting period accounted for 27% of all incidents, up from 14% year on year.“This is a trend that has been reflected in public reporting of high-profile cases of disruptive ransomware and denial-of-service attacks affecting New Zealand private and public sector organizations,” said NCSC director Lisa Fong.Blurred linesThe 28% of attacks linked to state-sponsored actors reflected a rise in absolute terms.One marker of nation state-backed attacks is their stealthier nature, suggested Fong.“State-sponsored activity is less likely to disrupt services and, indeed, sophisticated actors will go to great lengths to hide their activity from detection, while attempting to extract valuable data that may help in gaining a geostrategic or political advantage,” she said.Read more of the latest critical infrastructure security newsHowever, distinguishing between state and criminal actors is increasingly tricky as the distinctions blur, noted Fong.“State actors sometimes work alongside or provide havens for criminal groups, and we are increasingly seeing criminal groups now using capabilities once only used by sophisticated state actors,” she said.Harms avertedThe NCSC estimates that its detect-and-disrupt capabilities have prevented NZ$119 million (US$84 million) worth of harm from being visited upon New Zealand’s critical organizations in the past 12 months through incidents averted or mitigated, and NZ$284 million (US$200 million) since 2016.In particular, the agency trumpeted the impact of its Malware Free Networks service, which shares threat intelligence with partners such as internet service providers.The NCSC estimates the service disrupted more than 2,000 malicious attacks and incidents in its first 12 months of operation.DON’T FORGET TO READ Vulnerability in FBI email infrastructure allowed malicious actor to send false cyber-attack warnings to thousands",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/number-of-cyber-attacks-infiltrating-critical-new-zealand-networks-soars,"['New', 'Zealand', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Cybercrime', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Email', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Malware', 'Ransomware', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Research', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'OpSec', 'Passwords', 'Authentication', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Government', 'Oceania', 'Data', 'Leak']"
no,Server-side vulnerabilities in Concrete CMS put thousands of websites under threat,Web admins urged to apply patches now,"Multiple security vulnerabilities in a popular open source content management system (CMS) could allow a malicious attacker to gain full control of the underlying web server.The issues were discovered in Concrete CMS by researchers from Fortbridge, who detailed how two race condition vulnerabilities combined with the insecure use of the uniqid() function could allow an attacker with low privileges to achieve remote code execution (RCE).Adrian Tiron from Fortbridge told The Daily Swig that the uniqid() function was not cryptographically secure. Instead, it returned a pseudo-random number, “allowing us to guess the name of a pseudo-random directory and then upload a web shell on the server”.As of this year, there are more than 62,000 live website that are built with Concrete CMS, the researchers said.Various flawsThe first vulnerability is a race condition in the file upload function that allows a Concrete CMS user to upload files from a remote server.Files are downloaded to ‘$temporaryDirectory’ – a class called VolatileDirectory which creates a temporary directory, that gets deleted at the end of each request.Researchers said that the name of the directory created will always be random, and so in order to guess the name of it, they needed to brute-force this directory to find where it was coming from.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsA single brute-force request takes 100ms to execute, meaning that researchers needed time to carry out their attack.As they looked to circumvent the 60-second cURL timeout, they turned to the uniqid() function, which returned the time and day to the microsecond.The blog reads: “[W]e will add a sleep() for 30-60 seconds in the test.php file which gets downloaded from the remote server.“This will basically force the CMS to keep the $temporaryDir directory for 30-60 seconds on the local filesystem before deleting it. Enough time for us to brute-force the directory name with Burp Turbo Intruder.”Once they had the name of the directory, researchers were able to request test.php, which writes a permanent shell in the parent directory.By making test.php execute for ~30 seconds to guess the directory name, a second race condition was created, meaning that test.php will be written on the CMS filesystem.This then allowed them to achieve RCE on the server.Patch nowSpeaking to The Daily Swig, Tiron advised Concrete CMS users to upgrade to versions 8.5.7 and 9.0.1, which are already available.He added: “The disclosure process was very smooth, and we didn’t encounter any issues, the Concrete CMS team was very friendly and cooperative.”RECOMMENDED HTTP header smuggling attack against AWS API Gateway exposes systems to cache poisoning",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/server-side-vulnerabilities-in-concrete-cms-put-thousands-of-websites-under-threat,"['Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'Research', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'SSRF', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques']"
no,HTTP header smuggling attack against AWS API Gateway exposes systems to cache poisoning,New hacking technique may pave the way for other serious attacks,"A security researcher has explained how a weakness in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) API Gateway could be exploited via a HTTP header smuggling attack.Daniel Thatcher, a researcher and penetration tester at Intruder, said in a blog post dated November 10 that header smuggling – a relevantly new form of request smuggling technique – can be used to hide HTTP request headers from select servers, while keeping them visible to others.Tampering with the visibility of requests during a server chain can be lead to the successful deployment of malicious requests and request smuggling. Mismatching requests on back and frontend servers can potentially force the leak of data and secrets, as well as IP restriction bypass and cache poisoning.Bypassing security controlsThe header smuggling method created by Thatcher creates a mutation in a header request designed to be sent through to backend infrastructure without being processed by a trusted frontend service.Thatcher says that while scanning bug bounty programs, he observed that APIs using the AWS API Gateway allowed header smuggling.If an attacker appended characters to a header name after a space – for example, by switching X-My-Header: test to X-My-Header abcd: test, then a mutation occurs which causes Amazon’s security controls to be circumvented.RELATED HTTP/2 flaws expose organizations to fresh wave of request smuggling attacksIn addition, the X-Forwarded-For header was being stripped and rewritten by a server on the front end, rendering it susceptible to similar tampering – and, therefore, AWS resource policies IP restriction bypass.“Backend servers often rely on frontend servers providing accurate information in the HTTP request headers,” Thatcher says. “[To] provide this information accurately, frontend servers must filter out the values of these headers provided by the client, which are untrusted and cannot be relied upon to be accurate.”However, when header smuggling is employed, these filters can be avoided, and information can be sent to backend systems where it is treated as trusted data.Coordinated disclosureThatcher reported his findings to the AWS security team, and the IP circumvention issue was quickly resolved.However, upon further testing, the cybersecurity researcher said it was still possible to smuggle headers to backend servers using the same mutation method and the Host header, causing an “easily exploitable cache poisoning issue”.Read more of the latest hacking techniquesDuring a penetration test, the researcher also found a similar IP restriction bypass issue in AWS Cognito, an AWS resource access and control application.In this case, the vulnerability is considered “very minor” as it permitted attackers to make a total of only 10 forgotten password requests before a suspect IP address was blocked.Thatcher thanked the AWS team for their rapid response, noting that the group is working “very fast to resolve the vulnerabilities considering the scale of their infrastructure”.The Daily Swig has reached out to the AWS team.

no,Vulnerability in FBI email infrastructure allowed malicious actor to send false cyber-attack warnings to thousands,Security issue saw fake emails sent from legitimate agency accounts,"Malicious actors were able to access FBI servers to send fake emails from its infrastructure due to a coding oversight, the US agency has admitted.Late last week, tens of thousands of emails were sent from FBI addresses warning recipients of impending cyber-attacks.Among the targets was investigative reporter Brian Krebs, who noted that the email’s message headers “indicated it had indeed been sent by the FBI, and from the agency’s own internet address”.VulnerabilityAccording to Krebs, he was contacted by an individual named as ‘Pompompurin’, who claimed responsibility for the incident and said they took advantage of a vulnerability in the FBI’s own systems to carry it out.“I could’ve 1000% used this to send more legit looking emails, trick companies into handing over data etc,” Pompompurin said, according to Krebs.“And this would’ve never been found by anyone who would responsibly disclose, due to the notice the feds have on their website.”Leaked OTPThe vulnerability was in the Law Enforcement Enterprise Portal (LEEP), a federal gateway allowing agencies access to shared resources. According to Pompompurin, the oversight leaked a one-time passcode.“Basically, when you requested the confirmation code [it] was generated client-side, then sent to you via a POST Request,” Pompompurin told Krebs. “This post request includes the parameters for the email subject and body content.”A script then replaced those parameters with his own message subject and body, automated the sending of the hoax message to thousands of email addresses.Read more of the latest security news from the USA statement from the FBI released yesterday (November 14) confirmed that the emails were sent from a legitimate server.It reads: “While the illegitimate email originated from an FBI operated server, that server was dedicated to pushing notifications for LEEP and was not part of the FBI’s corporate email service.“No actor was able to access or compromise any data or PII on the FBI’s network.

no,"Removing need to unlock mobile wallets for contactless payments has eroded security protections, researchers warn",Mind the gap,"Moves to make it easier to use contactless payments on public transport systems have eroded the security of mobile wallets, security researchers have discovered.Before 2019, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay did not allow payments unless the mobile device was first unlocked by a fingerprint, Face ID, or PIN.But to make contactless payments easier during the pandemic, ‘public transport schemes’ were introduced by train and metro systems in many cities worldwide that made it possible for travellers to pass through a barrier without unlocking their phones.Transport cardsTo this end, ‘transport cards’ were made available by Visa, MasterCard, and Amex to travellers in Japan, the UK, the US, and China.Once a traveller has enrolled and added a transport card to their wallet, they can enter, for example, a metro station, passing through the gates without unlocking their phone.As a result of extensive research, a security research team from Positive Technologies found inconsistencies in contactless payments for public transport schemes that lead to potential fraud when mobile phones are lost or stolen.Catch up with the latest mobile security newsThe researchers discovered purported vulnerabilities in Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay that allow attackers to hack the Transport Card credentials connected to stolen mobile devices on which public transport schemes are activated.They subsequently demonstrated how these compromised credentials might be used to make fraudulent purchases on other terminals and not only those limited to public transport. Such attacks would work up to the point a victim reports a theft and compromised card credentials are cancelled by their bank.Cryptogram confusionOne of the attacks discovered is the so-called cryptogram confusion attack, which relies on “different views on the cryptogram type from mobile wallets and cards from one side and authorisation hosts from another”.Results from attacks were dependant on both the card type (whether Visa, MasterCard or AMEX) and payment method (Apple Pay, Google Pay or Samsung Pay), and in many cases required the use of modified or compromised terminals.However, since many fraudsters use compromised terminals for card attacks this in itself is not a major hurdle, and this fraud tactic is prevalent in Latin America, in particular.The research was presented in a talk entitled ‘Hand in Your Pocket Without You Noticing: Current State of Mobile Wallet Security’ and delivered to the Black Hat Europe conference last week.Positive Technologies reported their findings to payment providers prior to their Black Hat presentationOpaque disclosureTimur Yunusov, a senior security researcher at Positive Technologies, said that the researchers had reported their findings to payment service providers prior to going public.The vulnerable software is created and reviewed by Visa and MasterCard, so these financial services firms are more integral to the issue than either Apple or Samsung. Transport providers are the least involved and weren’t contacted by the three researchers – Yunusov, his PT colleague Artem Ivachev, and independent researcher Aleksei Stennikov.The subsequent disclosure and remediation process was somewhat opaque.Yunusov explained that at “some point between April and October 2021, the cryptogram confusion attack was fixed by MasterCard. Visa’s reaction was silence. But after similar research was published by the University of Birmingham they have responded with their traditional ‘as long as we don't see these attacks in the wild, we are not planning to change anything, we are sufficient, our risk-based business model works’,” said the researcher.Worst-case scenariosHe went on to outline the worst-case scenarios of what might be possible through a successful fraudulent attack.“{In the] worst-case scenario – attackers use stolen phones and they could use these stolen mobile wallets to pay in supermarkets, stores, anywhere in the world, presuming that these cards were not blocked by the card/phone owners,” Yunusov told The Daily Swig.“MasterCard closed this possibility for Samsung Pay as I explained previously. Visa didn’t. So it’s still possible with the pair Apple/Visa and GPay/MasterCard.”“For other pairs such as Apple/MC and Samsung Pay (currently after all fixes) hackers need special equipment for that – modified POS like the one we used in our last research.”In response to queries from The Daily Swig, Visa said the research covered something that fell short of posing a ‘real world’ risk, adding that it was comfortable with its current security controls.Visa cards connected to mobile wallets with transit features are secure and cardholders should continue to use them with confidence. Variations of contactless fraud schemes have been studied in laboratory settings for more than a decade and have proven to be impractical to execute at scale in the real world.Multiple layers of security are used to protect payments and consumers benefit from Visa’s zero liability guarantee. Visa takes all security threats seriously and continuously evolves its payment security capabilities to protect cardholders from the latest real-world threats.Mastercard is yet to respond to our request for comment.More details on the research, including a rundown on how the payment technology works, descriptions of attacks, and suggestions for remediations can be found in a white paper. The research is the latest in a series that previously covered potential point-of-sale (POS) authentication control hacks and cheating the then contactless limit.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Laws and regulations need to change to secure world’s digital infrastructure",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/removing-need-to-unlock-mobile-wallets-for-contactless-payments-has-eroded-security-protections-researchers-warn,"['Mobile', 'Black', 'Hat', 'Finance', 'Encryption', 'Research', 'Fraud', 'Cybercrime', 'Events', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Latin', 'America', 'Compliance', 'IoT', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Japan', 'UK', 'US', 'China', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'North', 'America', 'Biometrics', 'Coronavirus']"
Yes,HTML smuggling: Fresh attack technique increasingly being used to target banking sector,Evasive malware is being spread via email in campaigns similar to those of nation-state actors,"A new attack technique called ‘HTML smuggling’, which spreads malware via email, is increasingly targeting banking organizations, Microsoft has claimed.The attack vector, which surfaced earlier this year, is described by the tech giant as “a highly evasive malware delivery technique” that leverages legitimate HTML5 and JavaScript features to obscure its true actions.Microsoft said that in recent months, it has witnessed the attack targeting banks via email campaigns that deploy banking malware, remote access Trojans (RATs), and other payloads.Read more of the latest news about malware attacksA blog post from the vendor explains that it first identified HTML smuggling techniques being deployed back in May, when it was used by nation-state attackers APT29, aka Nobelium, during a spear-phishing campaign.“More recently, we have also seen this technique deliver the banking Trojan Mekotio, as well as AsyncRAT/NJRAT and Trickbot, malware that attackers utilize to gain control of affected devices and deliver ransomware payloads and other threats,” Microsoft detailed.The attackHTML smuggling attacks enable a malicious actor to “smuggle” an encoded script within a specially crafted HTML attachment or web page.If the target opens the HTML in their web browser, the malicious script is decoded and the payload is deployed on their device.“Thus, instead of having a malicious executable pass directly through a network, the attacker builds the malware locally behind a firewall,” the blog explains.HTML smuggling attacks bypass standard perimeter security controls, such as web proxies and email gateways, that often only check for suspicious attachments – EXE, ZIP, or DOCX files, for example – or traffic based on signatures and patterns.The malicious files are also created after the HTML file is loaded on the endpoint through the browser, meaning that security tools may only see what they deem to be legitimate HTML content and JavaScript traffic before it’s too late.TimelineMicrosoft has been tracking these attacks since at least May, when it identified the Nobelium campaign.Since then, it notes, it has seen a number of attempts such as an attack in July and August, when Microsoft said the “open-source intelligence (OSINT) community signals” showed an uptick in HTML smuggling in campaigns that deliver remote access Trojans (RATs) such as AsyncRAT/NJRAT.In September, researchers also witnessed an email campaign that leverages HTML smuggling to deliver Trickbot, a notorious banking trojan that has targeted worldwide organizations and institutions in the education, healthcare, and finance industry in recent years.Microsoft has attributed this Trickbot campaign to an “emerging, financially motivated cybercriminal group” it has named ‘DEV-0193’.BACKGROUND Trickbot arrest: Russian national extradited to US for alleged role in developing notorious banking trojanDEV-0193 is believed to target organizations primarily in the health and education industries, explained Microsoft.The vendor said that the group “works closely with ransomware operators, such as those behind the infamous Ryuk ransomware”.“After compromising an organization, this group acts as a fundamental pivot point and enabler for follow-on ransomware attacks. They also often sell unauthorized access to the said operators.“Thus, once this group compromises an environment, it is highly likely that a ransomware attack will follow,” Microsoft claims.The Microsoft blog contains more technical detail on the DEV-0193 campaign. RECOMMENDED Two men charged with deploying REvil ransomware attacks, targeting US government and businesses",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/html-smuggling-fresh-attack-technique-increasingly-being-used-to-target-banking-sector,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Malware', 'Email', 'Security', 'Phishing', 'Ransomware', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Microsoft', 'Industry', 'News', 'Finance', 'Organizations', 'Cybercrime', 'Healthcare', 'US', 'North', 'America']"

Alan's legacy is that a lot of bad things did not happen, and that a lot of good people entered this field to help.”In another tribute, Federal News Network executive editor Jason Miller said: “Alan Paller loved to talk about the soft skills of cybersecurity. And he did so with a passion, a conviction and a sincerity rarely seen in the federal community.”Phil Hagen, director of the SANS research and operations center, tweeted: “He truly forged this industry and never ceased improving it, along with every one of us who play a part.

If some end up leaked, it can be difficult to find out where, how, and whether or not their exposure poses a security risk.In September, the cybersecurity firm released TruffleHog, a Chrome browser extension designed to find API Keys for software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud services that have accidentally made their way into JavaScript. During testing, dozens of private encryption keys were found.Truffle Security co-founder Dylan Ayrey said Driftwood builds upon Trufflehog’s ability to find leaky keys by leveraging open ledgers of public keys.Read more about the latest hacking toolsThe tool uses two sources: Google’s Certificate Transparency project, an open log of TLS certificates created after 2018, and GitHub SSH keys, which together create a database of billions of keys.“Because GitHub lets you query these SSH keys for other users, we are able to use Driftwood to quickly figure out if a private key happens to pair with a GitHub user,” Truffle Security said.Driftwood in actionIn a blog post this week, Ayrey explained that Driftwood is able to take an asymmetric private key, extract the public key component, and then compare this key to the TLS/SSH key database to check if it pairs with a known, sensitive key.During testing, a 50,000-strong sample revealed “dozens” of private GitHub user SSH keys containing push rights to hundreds of repositories including those owned by major tech firms, according to the cybersecurity outfit.In addition, hundreds of certificates matching these keys – that were active and needed to be revoked – were found.READ MORE Dependency Combobulator offers defense against namespace confusion attacksApproximately 2,500 private keys also appeared in the sample, encrypted with symmetric encryption keys, of which passwords could be guessed in 70% of cases.Truffle Security has worked to have compromised certificates revoked and keys rotated ahead of the tool’s public release.The firm’s Driftwood tool is available on GitHub.

no,GoCD bug chain provides second springboard for supply chain attacks,Follow-up to recent GoCD disclosure provides additional path to infiltrating build environments,"The maintainers of GoCD, a widely used, open source tool that automates the continuous delivery (CD) of software, have addressed three vulnerabilities that, if chained, could lead to the underlying server being taken over.The security flaws – comprising CVE-2021-43288, CVE-2021-43286, and CVE-2021-43289 – were discovered by Simon Scannell and Thomas Chauchefoin of SonarSource.“An attacker who successfully exploits these vulnerabilities can leak intellectual property, modify source code, gain access to production environments, and backdoor any software that the CI/CD server produces,” Scannell and Chauchefoin tell The Daily Swig.“As a result, attackers could launch supply chain attacks.”PoC scripts circulatingThey add: “This finding can be mass-exploited and does not require any knowledge of the targeted instance; we are aware of researchers who published proof-of-concept scripts for it.”As previously covered by The Daily Swig, the disclosure follows SonarSource’s recent detailing of an arbitrary file read flaw, CVE-2021-43287, in the same platform.BACKGROUND Critical flaw in GoCD provides platform for supply chain attacks“This new attack surface led to the discovery of three additional vulnerabilities and the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server,” Scannell and Chauchefoin say.The first of the additional vulnerabilities is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) bug that allows attackers to impersonate administrators visiting a malicious job status page, allowing security-sensitive actions to be secretly performed.The following two could then be chained with the first to fully compromise the targeted instance.‘Straightforward to exploit’“The next steps of the chain are also straightforward to exploit in real-life scenarios, even if user interaction is required to exploit CVE-2021-43288,” the researchers say.“Threat actors could simply force jobs to fail to incite administrators to go on the GoCD interface, triggering the stored [XSS] payload. After that, RCE is only two bugs away.”Read more of the latest cybersecurity vulnerability news and analysisExploiting these flaws could allow attackers to leak API keys to external services such as Docker Hub and GitHub, steal private source code, get access to production environments, and overwrite files being produced as part of the build process – potentially leading to supply-chain attacks.Go patch your systemsSonarSource reported the vulnerabilities to the GoCD team between October 18 and 21, and patches were pushed via GitHub on October 23.

no,Zero tolerance: How infosec’s online ‘cancel culture’ is stunting industry growth,Fear of Twitter fallout is stopping vital information from being shared,"Social media backlash and online squabbling is stopping the information security industry from learning from its mistakes, Black Hat Europe attendees heard today.Speaking at the conference that’s being held in London and virtually this week, security analyst Regina Bluman argued that peer-led criticism is stopping vital knowledge from being shared online.This is due to the fear of backlash from industry peers, especially for organizations and individuals who have suffered a security breach.Often the victim of a data breach will shy away from publishing the details online, meaning that others can’t benefit from their experience.SolarWinds on trialBluman told The Daily Swig that the idea for her research was sparked during this year’s Cyber UK conference, which had the CEO of SolarWinds, Sudhakar Ramakrishna, as a keynote speaker.She said that during his talk, the online comments section of the platform was flooded with criticism from attendees questioning why he should be presenting, given the very recent supply chain attack at the company.RELATED SolarWinds hack: Nation-state attackers could have launched supply chain attack nine months earlier than previously thought“I was thinking, we’re going about this the wrong way,” said Bluman. “We should be learning from people who have made massive mistakes and who have really, you know, messed up.”Bluman said that the “zero tolerance approach” within the online community is holding the industry back from learning from mistakes.She added: “We haven’t solved it yet as an industry – people are still clicking on phishing links, companies are still getting hit by ransomware… things are still not perfect, so why not learn from people who have gone before us and have made those mistakes rather than criticizing them and making them pariahs of the industry?”Read more of the latest news and updates from Black HatAs summarized by Bluman in her abstract for the conference, “One only needs to hop on social media in the aftermath of any breach to see the ‘hot takes’ that abound”.This can be particularly true on platforms such as Twitter, which are often awash with opinion on the latest security failing by an individual or company.“People forget, especially after a breach happens, it’s all of us behind those systems and behind those breaches – it’s our peers,” mused Bluman.“We’re all one step away from it [a breach], and you never know what a company is going through in terms of budget approvals, in terms of how long it takes to implement things, but every company has those challenges.“It’s very easy for us to sit on the outside and say, ‘Oh, I can’t believe they didn’t have that installed', or ‘I can’t believe they didn’t configure it this way’. You have no idea what resource challenges or budget challenges [they face].”Bluman added: “Everyone likes to blame the big, bad, corporate guys and they get all the flack. They deserve it sometimes, you can look at some mistakes and be like, well, it was a ticking time bomb. But 90% of the time, it’s something that could happen to anybody.”The fear of Twitter fallout is stopping vital information from being shared, says the researcherWidespread problemBluman’s research involved speaking to people from the industry with differing levels of experience, from well-known figures such as Trend Micro vice president Rik Ferguson to security researchers and CISOs.After determining that this was indeed a “widespread problem”, Bluman asked the security pros how they navigate better knowledge sharing?“One of the big hurdles in terms of knowledge sharing [in] our industry is that a lot of the stuff we do is confidential, right?“And so, it makes it really difficult to put your hands up and say, ‘I made this massive mistake’, because you could be held liable for a breach of data. The stakes are higher.”RECOMMENDED Lessons learned: How a severe vulnerability in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set sparked much-needed changeShe explained: “No one needs to know the details. No one needs to know what was misconfigured. It’s more: how did you discover this? How could you learn it for next time?“And so the how and the why of what happened don’t really kind of matter as much.”Bluman looked at various knowledge sharing consortiums to identify what they do well, and what gaps they have, concluding that “a lot of them don’t do communication outside of their sector very well”.Finally, the researcher looked at how to address these issues and laid out recommendations.She argued that companies should take a more active role in admitting their mistakes, managers should create a better working culture for employees to admit their failings and, importantly, individuals online should “not be a d*ck”.“One of the call-to-actions is the golden rule of just don’t be a d*ck to people.

yes,Palo Alto GlobalProtect users urged to patch against critical vulnerability,Details withheld about dangerous threat as orgs given one-month patching window,"Security researchers have discovered a high-impact vulnerability on some versions of the widely used Palo Alto GlobalProtect Firewall/VPN that leaves enterprise networks open to attack.The vulnerability (CVE 2021-3064; with a ‘critical’ CVSS score of 9.8) allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on multiple versions of PAN-OS 8.1 prior to 8.1.17.Systems running PAN-OS versions 9.0, 9.1. 10.0, and 10.1 are immune but that still leaves thousands of older, internet-exposed systems open to attack.Catch up with the latest network security newsThe security flaw was discovered by Randori, a red team-focused security consultancy, a year ago. Randori has since developed a working exploit that illustrates the scope for potential mischief.“If an attacker successfully exploits this vulnerability they gain a shell on the affected target, access sensitive configuration data, extract credentials, and more,” the researchers said.“Once an attacker has control over the firewall, they will have visibility into the internal network and can proceed to move laterally.”GlobalProtectRandori reported the issue to Palo Alto, which released patches earlier this week.Palo Alto’s advisory on Wednesday (November 10) acknowledges that some versions its firewall products are vulnerable while stating that’s there no evidence of attacker exploitation. It reads:A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The attacker must have network access to the GlobalProtect interface to exploit this issue.Palo Alto confirms that the flaw presents an unauthenticated RCE risk. “This issue enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker with access to a GlobalProtect interface to execute arbitrary code with root user privileges,” it warns.One-month patch windowPAN-OS 8.1.17 and all later PAN-OS versions resolve the risk. Only PAN-OS firewall configurations with a GlobalProtect portal or gateway enabled are at risk, providing they are still on the older but still widely used PAN-OS 8.1 branch.The exploit developed by Randori involves chaining together a method for bypassing validations made by an external web server (HTTP smuggling) and a stack-based buffer overflow (a memory corruption issue).Both physical and virtual firewall products running the affected software are vulnerable.“Publicly available exploit code does not exist at this time,” Randori said.RELATED Palo Alto firewall software vulnerability quartet revealedMore technical details on the vulnerability will only be released on December 10, giving enterprises around a month to carry out security triage and apply mitigations or patch systems.For organizations not using the VPN capability as part of the firewall, Randori recommends that GlobalProtect should be disabled.In other cases, web application firewall, segmentation, and access controls offer the potential to limit risk short of patching, which remains the best method for protecting vulnerable systems.In a statement to the press, Randori estimated – based on data from Shodan – that there are currently more than 70,000 vulnerable Palo Alto GlobalProtect Firewall/VPN instances exposed on internet-facing assets.However, in a technical blog post, Randori talks about more than 10,000 exposed systems.The Daily Swig has asked for clarification on this point, as well as comment on the type of malfeasance created by the vulnerability.

no,Dependency Combobulator offers defense against namespace confusion attacks,Toolkit ‘tackles common scenarios’ and can evolve to detect emerging attack variants,"An open source toolkit designed to detect and thwart dependency confusion attacks was unveiled at Black Hat Europe 2021 yesterday.Developed by DevSecOps vendor Apiiro, Dependency Combobulator can be embedded within the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and CI/CD workflows, detecting malicious packages at the SDLC’s commit, build, or release phases.The modular, Python-based framework gives application security practitioners a means to evaluate releases against package management schemes and sources including GitHub Packages and JFrog Artifactory.Dependency confusion attacksDependency confusion – or namespace confusion – attacks poison the open source software ecosystem by duping developers and automation systems into installing malicious dependencies that imitate legitimate packages.Attackers discover legitimate software packages’ internal-facing dependency references before building a malicious package and uploading it to a public registry with the same name as a targeted privately hosted package.RELATED Open source ecosystem ripe for dependency confusion attacks, research findsThe attack technique was pioneered by security researcher Alex Birsan. Disclosed in February 2021, his proof-of-concept attack resulted in “tens of thousands of callouts from different endpoints”, many belonging to Fortune 500 companies, Moshe Zioni, VP of security research at Apiiro, told attendees watching on Black Hat Europe’s Arsenal track yesterday (November 10).Many similarly constructed but malicious attacks have followed, including one that prompted the NPM Registry and Python Package Index (PyPI) to remove thousands of rogue packages in March.Adapting to emerging variantsOut of the box, Dependency Combobulator currently supports the NPM and maven package management schemes, but Apiiro says it will readily accommodate the addition of other package management systems.“It’s part of our philosophy [that the tool is] easy to understand, modify, and expand – especially if you have something custom-made or a package manager that is not currently available as an option,” explained Zioni.Catch up with our latest Black Hat Europe 2021 coverageThe researcher said the toolkit can “tackle common scenarios, which can be diverse”, and be adapted to detect emerging attack variations. “If you see other heuristic profiles you want to submit this will be very easy to implement,” he added.Currently, MetaPackage, which instantiates package representation that is then scrutinized by the heuristics engine, can incorporate properties such as whether a package exists on a registry; if it’s forked; download count; a stability, quality or security score given by the registry; last time to upload; version(s); and publisher names.The abstract model will at some point be enriched with additional security properties, said Zioni, while the range of sources and registries will be expanded.The researcher invited the open source community to suggest new features and other improvements. “We would like to bring more and more value to more and more people,” he said.DON’T FORGET TO READ Linux community project aims to tackle dependency confusion attacks with easy code signing, verification",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/dependency-combobulator-offers-defense-against-namespace-confusion-attacks,"['Black', 'Hat', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'DevSecOps', 'OpSec', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'Malware', 'Research', 'Python', 'JavaScript', 'java', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Events']"
No,‘Add yourself as super admin’ – Researcher details easy-to-exploit bug that exposed GSuite accounts to full takeover,Technical details of long-since patched Google cloud software vulnerability released,"A security researcher has released details of a high-impact, but long-since patched vulnerability in Google’s GSuite that allowed an attacker to add themselves as a super admin on any organization’s account.Back in 2018, researcher Cameron Vincent was probing Google’s attack surface for bugs under the tech giant’s Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP).The object of his attention was GSuite – Google’s suite of cloud computing, productivity, and collaboration tools that was rebranded as Workspace last year – particularly the domain.google.com registrar feature.RELATED Google awards Uruguayan researcher $133,337 top prize in cloud security competition“In GSuite the main admins of the organization are super admins,” Vincent explains in a blog post published this week (November 9). “They can create group[s], manage users, change users’ passwords, [and] manage everything.”After creating a GSuite account subscription, the super admin uses domains.google.com to manage users, add other admins, and manage payment methods.Manipulating requestsIn examining the ‘add new user’ process through domains.google.com, Vincent discovered that simply manipulating POST requests could allow an attacker to add themselves as administrator of any organization’s GSuite account.“There are two things needed to do this,” he said. “First, you need the domain of the GSuite org… and then the ID of the GSuite organization you are targeting.”A proof of concept video shows the attack in action.Read more of the latest web security research from around the worldIn written comments to The Daily Swig this week, Vincent confirmed that he discovered the flaw back in 2018 – well before GSuite’s rebranding to Workspace, as the software package is now known.He decided to release the details this week as part of a wider project to revisit his previous security research under Google and Microsoft’s bug bounty programs.“It was properly disclosed through Google’s VRP program and [I] was given a bounty,” he said.Still, the huge popularity of the software (more than four million businesses were said to be using GSuite in 2018) and easy-to-exploit nature of the bug will no doubt make sobering reading for sysadmins.Google did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

yes,Smuggling hidden backdoors into JavaScript with homoglyphs and invisible Unicode characters,Researchers urge developers to secure code by disallowing non-ASCII characters,"Security researchers have detailed how backdoors can be concealed within JavaScript by Unicode characters that are either invisible or readily confused with other characters.As a result, they contend, malicious code can evade detection during even otherwise thorough code reviews.Inherently effective at obfuscating code, “Unicode should be kept in mind when doing reviews of code from unknown or untrusted contributors” – something particularly applicable to open source projects, said Wolfgang Ettlinger, security researcher at Austrian cybersecurity firm Certitude Consulting, in a blog post.Leave no traceThe hacking technique was inspired by a Subreddit post documenting a developer’s struggles to identify a syntax error resulting from an invisible Unicode character hidden in JavaScript source code.Resolving to implant a backdoor that trails no evidence of its presence, the researchers chose “?” (called a ‘HANGUL FILLER’) as their invisible Unicode character because it has the ID_Start property and can therefore appear in a JavaScript variable.RECOMMENDED ‘Focus on brilliance at the basics’ – GitHub CSO Mike Hanley on shifting left and securing the software supply chainThe following code snippet visualizes how the invisible character could pass unnoticed by replacing the character in question with its escape sequence representation: const { timeout,\u3164} = req.query;.A destructuring assignment retrieves from req.query the timeout and “?” parameters, and if passed the “?” is assigned to the invisible variable, explained Ettlinger.Similarly, when the checkCommands array is constructed, this hidden variable makes it into the array, whose constituent elements are passed to the exec function, which duly executes OS commands.An attacker could execute arbitrary OS commands by passing the “?” parameter to the endpoint in its URL-encoded form, said Ettlinger.“This approach cannot be detected through syntax highlighting as invisible characters are not shown at all and therefore are not colorized by the IDE/text editor,” he added.Homoglyph attacksMeanwhile, the researchers found that homoglyph attacks could be mounted using Unicode ‘confusables’ – such as ?, ?,?, ?, ?, ?, ?, and ? – that resembled operators.Ettlinger posted a script in which the ‘?’ character is actually an ‘ALVEOLAR CLICK’. The relevant line – if(environment?=ENV_PROD){ – therefore assigns the ‘PRODUCTION’ string to the previously undefined environment? variable.“Thus, the expression within the ‘if’ statement is always true,” said Ettlinger.Real-world probability“We haven’t holistically studied what additional factors could prevent this approach, therefore we cannot make any definitive statement to the real-world probability of such attacks,” Ettlinger tells The Daily Swig.Catch up with the latest hacking techniques news and analysisHe points out that unexpected behavior from auto-formatters might tip-off developers, and that “the Webstorm IDE can at least highlight the ‘invisible’ characters”.He also recommends that using certain tools and conducting regular security code reviews throughout the development lifecycle can expose backdoor code.Stick to ASCIIThe researcher suggested developers protect their code from such attacks by proscribing the use of non-ASCII characters, which “are pretty rare in code” since development teams typically favor English language-based, ASCII characters.“Translation into other languages is often done using dedicated files,” said Ettlinger. “When we review German language code, we mostly see non-ASCII characters being substituted with ASCII characters (e.g. ä ? ae, ß ? ss).”Coincidentally, researchers from the University of Cambridge recently documented a similar attack centred on the Unicode bidirectional mechanism (Bidi), proposing restricted use of Bidi Unicode characters as mitigation.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/smuggling-hidden-backdoors-into-javascript-with-homoglyphs-and-invisible-unicode-characters,"['Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'JavaScript', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News', 'Austria', 'Europe']"
no,Black Hat Europe: Laws and regulations need to change to secure world’s digital infrastructure,"Better incentives to build secure products needed, former MEP tells conference","Tighter restrictions against digital weapons and a reframing of the economics of cybersecurity are needed to stop the erosion of democratic institutions and values, delegates at Black Hat Europe heard today (November 10).Marietje Schaake, international policy director at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center, warned that the way the digital infrastructure currently operates is eroding democratic principles in ways that and leave us vulnerable to cyber-attacks.During her keynote addresses – entitled Securing the public, who is in charge? – the former Member of European Parliament (MEP) argued that democratic principles should lead the governance of security.Digital warfareThe US government applied sanctions to NSO Group at the start of November after deciding that sales of its controversial Pegasus spyware ran contrary to US national security or foreign policy interests.The move will make it harder for US security researchers to sell vulnerabilities to NSO Group, whose surveillance tools have been used against journalists and human rights activists.But NSO Group and other sanctioned companies are far from an isolated case, according to Schaake, who criticized the rise of what she described as “mercenaries in cyberspace”.Read more of the latest news and updates from Black Hat“Intrusive tools are no longer in the hands of NSA [alone]… There’s a growing market of intrusion-as-a-service and targeted surveillance,” Schaake said.The politician-turned-academic warned that these technologies were undermining press freedom, privacy, freedom of assembly, and other human rights.Despite this, “democratic governments have barely acted” according to Schaake, who criticized European tech firms for selling to repressive regimes in Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring uprisings of 2010-11.EU export control laws were recently tightened up but these “watered down” provisions do not nearly go far enough not least but they do little to restrict imports. “There’s a lack of openness about the outsourcing of surveillance capabilities,” according to Schaake.Marietje Schaake is the international policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy CenterSecuring the supply chainWhile accepting that software can never be secure, the risks need to be more effectively mitigated to deal with the growing threat posed by zero-day vulnerabilities and software supply chain attacks.“Ransomware attacks [are] like a pandemic of their own,” she added.US gas supplier Colonial Pipeline, a recent, high-profile victim of a ransomware attack, may be able to claim a subsequent ransomware payment is tax deductible, a rule that could act to effectively incentivize payments to cybercriminals and fuel a growing problem, Schaake argued.This could leave cybercriminals are other attackers in positions of power, though “not even the best functioning responsible disclosure programs have not tilted that scale”, according to Schaake.While accepting that there are “no easy answers”, the director concluded her talk by offering a seven-step action program towards improving cybersecurity. Shaake said that government should:Apply stronger transparency requirements and improve information sharing to strengthen incident responseBan the worst systems – at minimum, “Pegasus should not be accessible to human rights abusers”Introduce stronger incentives to build more secure software through best practice guides and negligence rulesMake firms update outdated systems by better patching and improved authentication controlsMake security a requirement for winning government software contractsIntroduce changes to make the public sector a more attractive place to workAnd improve cross-border collaboration.Schaake concluded the keynote presentation with an appeal to the community to both help build and advocate for more secure products and services.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Two charged with deploying REvil ransomware attacks, targeting US gov't and businesses",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/black-hat-europe-laws-and-regulations-need-to-change-to-secure-worlds-digital-infrastructure,"['Black', 'Hat', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Government', 'Surveillance', 'Spyware', 'Ransomware', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Malware', 'Industry', 'News', 'Zero-day', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Events', 'US', 'Europe', 'Russia', 'Asia', 'North', 'America', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure']"
no,Apache Storm maintainers patch two pre-auth RCE vulnerabilities,High-risk issues were discovered by GitHub’s in-house security team,"Apache Storm, an open source real-time streaming data analytics platform, has patched two vulnerabilities that led to remote code execution (RCE).Discovered and reported by GitHub Security Lab, the bugs included a command injection vulnerability and an unsafe deserialization bug.Command injection in Apache Storm NimbusThe first of the two vulnerabilities was found in one of the functions of Nimbus, the principal component of Storm, which runs on top of a Thrift server.The function getTopologyHistory takes a username argument and concatenates it into a shell command without sanitizing it. An attacker can exploit the argument to send operating system commands to the Apache server.RELATED Apache HTTP Server devs issue fix for critical data leak vulnerability – update now“This vulnerability was not exploitable when reached through the REST API since the username that holds the payload cannot be controlled by an attacker,” Alvaro Munoz, researcher at GitHub Security Labs, told The Daily Swig.“However, I found out that I could directly call the Thrift service and provide any username.”When called directly through the Nimbus Thrift port, the function does not require any special privileges, which leads to a pre-auth RCE. Munoz posted a proof-of-concept that exploits the bug to execute the ‘touch’ command on the server operating system.“The Apache Storm security guide recommends enabling a firewall and to restrict network access to these services, but unfortunately, there are many publicly exposed servers not following these recommendations,” Munoz said.Unsafe deserialization on supervisor serverThe second bug was found in Storm’s supervisor service, which runs on top of a Netty server. In his research, Munoz discovered that the server’s inbound pipeline (the different handlers that process the incoming network packets) uses an object parser that is prone to unsafe deserialization. An attacker can exploit the bug to send a malicious object and run it on the server.Munoz became familiar with the Netty framework during a recent code review of Apache Dubbo, where he modeled the library with CodeQL, GitHub’s semantic code analysis engine, and identified possible sources of untrusted data.Read more of the latest security vulnerabilities“My past experience reviewing Apache Dubbo granted me familiarity with the Netty framework and in particular with the Netty architecture and inbound pipelines,” Munoz said.A proof-of-concept shows the bug being exploited to load a gadget payload and run a DNS resolution command on the server. Like the code injection vulnerability, the deserialization bug also leads to pre-auth RCE.“When I first reviewed the CodeQL result, I wasn’t sure about the criticality of the issue since the Storm workers can be configured to require authentication,” Munoz said. “However, after looking at the Netty inbound pipeline, I realized that the authentication was applied after triggering the deserialization. Therefore, an attacker would be able to trigger it with no valid credentials.”Key takeaways“These vulnerabilities can affect default installations of Apache Storm. It is recommended to update as per the announcements,” Derek Dagit, member of the Apache Storm Project Management Committee (PMC), told The Daily Swig.Regarding the code injection bug, Dagit said that the key takeaway is to treat any code that invokes an interpreter with scrutiny.“The serialization vulnerability is harder to exploit, but its takeaway is simpler: In general, Java native serialization without registered types isn’t safe, neither as a default nor as a fallback,” he added.Munoz recommended that web developers should apply validations as close as possible to the point where data is going to be consumed.The Apache Storm vulnerabilities are also a reminder that authentication should be applied as early as possible in the data processing chain to reduce the chances of unauthenticated users being able to trigger potential vulnerabilities in the code, he said.“Generally, enabling static analysis in your build pipeline can help you prevent critical bugs like these ones.

no,Security breach at trading platform Robinhood sparks phishing fears,Social engineering attack exposes email addresses of five million investors,"US trading platform Robinhood Markets has admitted that client data has been stolen by crooks who tricked a customer support employee.The social engineering attack on November 3 allowed miscreants to access customer support systems where they took data including the names of two million customers and more extensive data on a small number of customers.In a statement issued on Monday (November 8), Robinhood Markets sought to play down fears by stating that it hasn’t come across any evidence that any financially sensitive information was exposed by the breach.“Based on our investigation, the attack has been contained and we believe that no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed and that there has been no financial loss to any customers as a result of the incident,” the firm said.Catch up with the latest cyber-attack newsRobinhood’s ongoing investigation have revealed that for a small subset of its customers – around 310 – their name, date of birth, and zip code, was exposed. In addition, 10 customers had “more extensive account details” revealed.The financial services firm is in the process of contacting those most affected directly.The exposed email addresses make it likely that Robinhood customers will find themselves targeted with follow-up phishing attacks seeking to hoodwink potential marks into handing over more sensitive information, so extra vigilance is strongly recommended.Ken Westin, director of security strategy at threat intel firm Cybereason, commented: “Minimally impacted consumer info can still be leveraged for secondary phishing attacks to gain access to accounts, making it critically important for their customers to be vigilant while regularly checking their accounts for any signs of fraud.”Social engineeringRobinhood Markets said that after detecting the intrusion, the as-yet-unidentified crooks attempted to obtain an extortionate payment.The financial services firm rebuffed this request and called in help from incident response experts and the police.“We promptly informed law enforcement and are continuing to investigate the incident with the help of Mandiant, a leading outside security firm,” Robinhood Markets said.Third-party security firms said the incident highlighted the importance of employee training as well as technical countermeasures such as multi-factor authentication to sensitive systems and least privileged access.Chris Deverill, UK director at Orange Cyberdefense, commented: “The fact malicious actors were able to access Robinhood’s systems after tricking a support desk worker on the phone proves the importance of implementing ongoing cybersecurity training and awareness.”Cybereason’s Westin added: “The breach appears to be the result of social engineering of a single customer support employee and a reminder that humans are oftentimes the weakest link in the ecosystem. To reduce risks, companies should have multiple layers of controls in place with restrictions on who can access mission critical data.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Interpol issues arrest warrants for members of Clop ransomware gang",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-breach-at-trading-platform-robinhood-sparks-phishing-fears,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Phishing', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'US', 'Finance', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'North', 'America']"

However, the exploit used against the beta version of the 3TB My Cloud Home Personal Cloud was really impressive, too.“That’s one to definitely watch for when the fix becomes available.”The 2021 edition included a consumer printer category for the first time in the wake of the pandemic-driven shift to home working, as well as the emergence of a noteworthy vulnerability in Microsoft’s Windows Print Spooler over the summer.Record entry numbersVendors now have 120 days to remediate vulnerabilities discovered during the event before contestants are permitted to disclose technical details.The Texas-based Pwn2Own edition featured a record 58 exploit attempts – around twice as many as the previous high – made by 22 teams or individual competitors against 22 devices, which also included TVs, routers, and home automation devices.Streaming via YouTube and Twitch since Covid-19 forced the organizers to offer remote participation “has helped engagement tremendously”, says Childs. “The goal is to make attending and participating in Pwn2Own open to anyone interested, regardless of where they are located.”Reaching $1,081,250, total prize money was slightly down on the $1,210,000 total winnings at the flagship, software-focused Pwn2Own event in April.‘Had a blast’The three members of team Synacktiv collectively told The Daily Swig: “We really had a blast in the months before the event and during the event itself and would like to thank ZDI again for the organization.“We began the preparation in September with the last exploit being finalized less than one week before the event, and we are proud that those efforts paid off.“A lot of our team members watched the stream during our attempts, and shared our joy of seeing Ninjas appear on printers, of Baby Shark playing on the Sonos, but also the stress of having one of our exploits running way longer than expected and of the final race with the DEVCORE Team.

no,Campaigning lawyers launch counter-offensive against software patent trolls,Stemming the tide of ‘stupid software patents and the trolls they feed’,"So-called ‘patent trolls’ have been the scourge of technology development for many years, but firms faced with questionable claims are now being offered support from experienced commercial lawyers campaigning against bad practice in the arena of intellectual property.Entities abusing the patent system are diverting resources from productive activities to legal fees. Technological advancement and access to technology can suffer as a result.Alex Moss, executive director of the Public Interest Patent Law Institute, a former staff attorney and the Mark Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), explained that a spirited defense against wrongly issued patents is necessary for technology businesses to flourish.RECOMMENDED Security organizations join forces with EFF to lobby for DMCA reform“For the past three years, EFF and others have been constantly on the defense against relentless efforts to rollback changes to patent law that stemmed the tide of stupid software patents and the trolls they feed,” Moss told The Daily Swig.The Public Interest Patent Law Institute (PIPLI) was created as a counterweight to pro-patent forces, which include some powerful senators on both sides of the political aisle as well as powerful companies like Qualcomm and brand pharmaceutical makers like Gilead.“President Biden just announced the nomination of a new Patent Office Director and there are about four different pieces of patent legislation under consideration by Congress, so there’s a lot happening to make [the topic of] patent trolls timely as ever,” Moss told The Daily Swig.Patent bending: A patent troll attempts to enforce patent rights for profit or to stifle competitionProtecting software-makers from patent trollsPIPLI’s goal is to ensure the patent system “promotes access to innovation of all kinds for the benefit of everyone”, Moss explained.The institute is planning to focus on helping individual developers, users, and small companies that are targeted by patent trolls (entities that make money off patents rather than developing products or services) and gathering information about troll demands.Catch up on the latest infosec policy and legislation newsIt also wants to help create more software-related ‘prior art’ (which can be used to invalidate patents and patent applications) available to the public and Patent Office, along with making the patent system itself more transparent and accountable to the public.Elsewhere Cloudflare’s Project Jengo is offering a crowdfunded resource that identifies cases of prior art, evidence that can be used to invalidate questionable patent claims.Patent trolls: Recent infosec and tech industry casesThe EFF has logged multiple cases of questionable patent claim enforcement practices, many in the arena of web security and information technology. According to the non-profit, these include:A family-owned GPS-tracking technology firm was allegedly threatened by a patent troll. The plaintiff backed down after learning that the EFF was involved.The Internet Archive was threatened by a US organization claiming to own re-CAPTCHA technology.Food delivery start-up goes out of business trying to defend against patent troll.Patent troll action against a photography website and a medical start-up.Datawing takes flight: An infosec patent troll caseThe Daily Swig first came across PIPLI’s work as we investigated allegations that UK firm Datawing was caught threatening small firms who had enabled the Content Security Policy (CSP) nonces web security feature.The institute offered support to organizations that had received letters from Datawing, which controversially claimed CSP nonces is covered by US and UK patents it holds.In the face of this opposition and criticism from web security experts such as Scott Helme, Datawing abandoned its licensing campaign and apologized for its “ill advised” letters.“Helping people like the developers who got demands from Datawing is exactly the kind of thing (in category one) that PIPLI was created to do,” Moss said.READ MORE Security training org pulls blog over copyright violations, promises editorial improvementsShe added: “This is a troubling example of something that happens all too often: a patent of questionable validity gets asserted against small companies and independent developers who don’t have the resources to hire or retain big firm lawyers and fear the negative publicity associated with infringement accusations.”It’s difficult for those wrongly accused of violating patents to resolve the issue, at least in the US, without going to court – always an expensive proposition.Moss explained: “Someone who gets a letter can [either] pay the license or pay a lawyer to fight back. Either way, they have to pay.“Given the cost, uncertainty, and time of fighting back in court, a patent owner can demand quite a lot of money for a license without demanding anything close to what defensive litigation would cost,” she added.How to respond to a patent troll – expert viewPossible legal costs, and other risk mitigation considerations, lead many firms faced with patent infringement threats to settle, even if they doubt the validity of patents.“It’s important that people realize how often this happens because license demands are typically kept secret, especially when they result in settlements,” Moss explained. “That’s because companies don’t want other patent owners to see them as easy targets.”Moss offered advice to small companies on how to respond to patent infringement claims and associated license requests: Don’t apologize.Let PIPLI know. “We want to gather and store information about licensing demands so that we can monitor patent troll activity, identify the worst offenders, and make it easier for potential co-defendants to find each other,” said Moss. “Since patent license demands are typically kept secret or confidential, there’s no easy way to find that out now.”Talk to a lawyer. “Organizations like PIPLI and EFF can help connect small companies with lawyers who can advise for free or at affordable rates on how potent the threat is.”Talk to in-house engineers. “When it comes to identifying non-infringement arguments, talking to in-house engineers can be extremely helpful,” Moss explained. “In the US, infringement only occurs if a product includes or performed each and every element of a patent claim. Small differences can make a huge difference. If engineers can see distinct differences between the way a company’s product works and what the patent claims, there may be strong non-infringement argument.Talk to similarly-situated companies in your industry to find out if they’ve faced similar infringement accusations. “If they have, they may be willing to share helpful information e.g, how much they paid, what lawyer they used, how aggressive the patent owner was,” said Moss. “And if they’re still facing such a demand, they may be willing to join forces in mounting a defense. Creating a joint defense group lets companies accused of infringing the same patent divvy up the costs of litigation, which may make it more economical to raise invalidity arguments in court.”RELATED UK firm accused of bullying small businesses with CSP patent infringement letters backtracks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/campaigning-lawyers-launch-counter-offensive-against-software-patent-trolls,"['Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Legal', 'Industry', 'News', 'Government', 'US', 'Analysis', 'North', 'America', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Organizations', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Privacy', 'Fraud', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Research', 'Interviews', 'Compliance', 'Hardware']"

no,Lessons learned: How a severe vulnerability in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set sparked much-needed change,Years-old WAF bypass flaw was discovered in June,"A severe vulnerability present in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) for several years was a “bang on the ear” for the project's maintainers, who have outlined steps to improve its security.The ModSec team reported that a complete rule set bypass (CVE-2021-35368) had been discovered in June 2021. The critical bug that had been present in the software for at least four years.As previously reported by The Daily Swig, the vulnerability bypassed the security protections offered by the in-built CRS web application firewall (WAF), meaning that malicious request body payloads could be smuggled through without being inspected.The issue, which was introduced in code changes 2017, has since been remediated.However, to help reduce the likelihood of another high-impact bug slipping through the net, the CRS maintainers have implemented new practices, guidelines, and a bug bounty program to further secure the technology.A chance for growthSpeaking to The Daily Swig, OWASP CRS co-lead Christian Folini said that the incident was “one of the biggest bangs on the ear” for him.He explained: “It was clearly my personal fault. I had introduced these two bugs right after our new team had taken over the dormant project in 2016. The fix was easy enough, yet I felt like hiding under a rock.”BACKGROUND WAF bypass: ‘Severe’ OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set bug was present for several yearsThe team met in Switzerland last week to formulate a plan to “improve set up and procedures”, said Folini, who admitted that the incident was an “embarrassment”.Folini said: “We started to look at it as a chance for growth and development. Therefore, we made it a focus theme for our first CRS developer retreat – how can we prevent merging bugs? And, if we carry them, how do we detect them in our rules?”Beyond automated testingFolini said that the CRS team has been slowly expanding its DevOps practices “for several years” since they took over in 2016.However, the project is in need of “a comprehensive application security program that goes beyond automatic testing”, according to Folini.Addressing the issue, he told The Daily Swig that the CRS team has implemented a list of changes that will foster a more proactive approach to security.“We ran a workshop at our retreat and tried to come up with various measures that would form several layers of defense against any failures in our rule set. Eventually we settled on four changes:- Rule exclusion packages will become plugins- We will forbid certain constructs/directives from the rule set- We will prepare a formal checklist to review every rule, namely new ones- We will launch a bug bounty program.”Shrinking the attack surfaceFolini explained that the bypass vulnerability was hidden in one of the rule exclusion packages, which are distributed together with the rule set.“Even an inactive rule exclusion package could cripple the entire rule set,” he said.“So, we want to transform these packages into plugins, leveraging the new plugin functionality that we are going to introduce with our next major release. Plugins are not installed by default, so this measure will reduce our attack surface.”Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsFolini told The Daily Swig that the bypass was only possible because a bad rule used a “very powerful” construct to disable request body access under certain conditions.“What we did not realize was that an attacker could meet these conditions by abusing the PATH_INFO part of the request URI,” he continued.“If we forbid this and similarly powerful directives, we reduce the impact of future bugs, so this is a risk limiting measure.”Folini also said that by introducing a formal checklist and a bug bounty program, code can be extensively reviewed, both internally and externally.This plan does, however, contain a caveat: In order to be able to pay such bounties, the project will need to attract more sponsors.Lessons learnedDespite the major security headache caused by the WAF bypass vulnerability, Folini is optimistic that the lessons learned will spark much-needed change.“Nobody likes to look like an idiot in public,” he admitted. “But it is important to take the bull by the horns.“Going out, writing a detailed advisory, informing the big integrators directly (in advance), responding to questions from the community and reviewing your own policies and procedures are all crucial steps if you want to grow and improve.“The whole affair also strengthened the ties within the team. We overcame this together and we know we can trust each other even when we’re in deep trouble and that’s very reassuring.“So ultimately, I think it was a positive experience and we trust that the community appreciates how we handled this severe incident.

no,Cisco patches critical bug trio in Policy Suite and ONT networking devices,Critical severity bugs disclosed by networking titan,"Cisco has patched critical vulnerabilities in Policy Suite software and its Catalyst Passive Optical Network (PON) switches that could lead to the full compromise of the platform and devices.A vulnerability in the key-based SSH (Secure Shell) authentication mechanism of Cisco Policy Suite could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access an affected system as root, according to a security advisory issued on Wednesday (November 3).Tracked as CVE-2021-40119, the flaw commands a CVSS rating of 9.8, just a sliver off the maximum severity of 10.0.Cisco Policy Suite is a policy, charging, and subscriber data management platform used by mobile telecommunications service providers.PING PONgA separate advisory details three unauthenticated bugs in the web-based management interface of certain PON optical network terminals (ONTs), two of which were assigned the maximum possible severity rating of CVSS 10.0.They include a flaw that exposes users to the risk of command injection attacks, courtesy of insufficient validation of user-supplied input (CVE-2021-40113).The other maximum-severity bug was found in the Telnet service (CVE-2021-34795) and could allow an attacker to seize control of vulnerable devices.Read more of the latest enterprise security newsExploitation involves logging into an affected device via a debugging account with a default, static password.The default credential works only over Telnet, a protocol that is disabled by default – twin factors that greatly mitigate the risk of attack.With a CVSS of 8.6, another, ‘high’ severity flaw (CVE-2021-40112) means attackers are able to modify a device’s configuration, thanks to improper validation of HTTPS input.The Cisco ONTs allow only local LAN connections to the web management interface by default, according to Cisco. “Therefore, all these vulnerabilities are exploitable only via the switches’ LAN ports unless Remote Web Management has been configured,” Cisco’s advisory explains.Cisco also emphasised that the three vulnerabilities are independent of each other.Software updatesThe PON ONT vulnerabilities affect firmware version 1.1 and CGP-ONT-1P – for which the patched update is 1.1.1.14 – as well as CGP-ONT-4P, CGP-ONT-4PV, CGP-ONT-4PVC, and CGP-ONT-4TVCW, for which patched version 1.1.3.17 has been released.Cisco Policy Suite users running versions earlier than 20.2.0 have been advised to upgrade to 21.1.0, while those running version 20.2.0 are advised to contact Cisco technical support to get a patch installed.Users running 21.1.0 can remedy the issue by changing the default SSH keys.“Releases 21.2.0 and later will automatically create new SSH keys during installation but not during an upgrade,” said Cisco.A Cisco spokesperson told The Daily Swig: “Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities described in the advisories. Fixed software is available, and we ask our customers to please review the advisories for complete information.”The Cisco Policy Suite vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing, while Marco Wiorek of German infosec firm Hotzone has been credited with reporting the PON ONT vulnerabilities.RELATED RCE vulnerability found in Sitecore enterprise CMS software",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cisco-patches-critical-bug-trio-in-policy-suite-and-ont-networking-devices,"['Cisco', 'Enterprise', 'Telecommunications', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hardware', 'Authentication', 'Compliance', 'Encryption', 'Mobile', 'Passwords', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Europe', 'Germany']"
no,‘Focus on brilliance at the basics’ – GitHub CSO Mike Hanley on shifting left and securing the software supply chain,"Security fundamentals often overlooked in favor of eye-catching initiatives, says infosec pro","INTERVIEW Software developers are still burdened with using needlessly complex security tools that can lead to workarounds, mistakes, or vulnerabilities in code, laments Mike Hanley, GitHub’s chief security officer (CSO).At the helm since February, GitHub’s first-ever CSO has previously occupied senior roles at Duo Security, Cisco, and the CERT Coordination Center.In a Q&A with The Daily Swig, Hanley contends that “mastering the basics” of security is as important as it is often neglected, and is enthusiastic about the potential of GitHub’s newest tools to facilitate ‘shifting left’ and bolstering software supply chains.How’s the new role going so far, Mike?Mike Hanley: It’s been an incredible first eight months at GitHub, and I’m really enjoying the scale of the platform and team.I spend a lot of time talking to customers, stakeholders in various teams, and people within my organization to help us craft a clear strategy and vision for security at GitHub, and then focus on creating great security outcomes for those groups.What structural changes to GitHub’s security operation, if any, have you overseen so far?MH: We approach security in the broadest sense, in that we include the traditional security functions like security operations and product security engineering, but also have anti-abuse and the GitHub Security Lab as part of our team.We brought all these teams together and elevated the function inside GitHub because we know that security and trust are core to everything we do, and we want to make sure all the teams are working together with a shared understanding of our expectations and goals from a security perspective.I’m fortunate to have come into this role where there was already an amazing team onboard, so we’re really focused on forward-looking investments and opportunities as we write this next chapter. We’ve already doubled the size of the team in just eight months and have several dozen more roles open across our entire team.Read more of the latest infosec industry newsWhich skills and experiences acquired in your previous positions are proving most transferable to your role at GitHub and why?MH: My first real job was tech support for a large IT services company. Starting out in a technical support role was extremely valuable in terms of learning about how things break, what that means for the experience of people trying to get their jobs done, and really helping me develop a ‘customer-first’ mindset to everything that I’ve done since.Combined with my experience at Duo Security, where I had the opportunity to build the security organization from scratch and focus on security products that are easy for people to use, these experiences really influence my approach to security at GitHub.GitHub has made a number of tools available to the open source communityIn a blog post you penned upon joining GitHub, you said that “good security and the speed of the business are not opposing concepts when met with thoughtful design and a customer-centric approach”. Can you elaborate on this point?MH: For a few decades now, the industry has been making security tools that are hard for people to use. In 1999, Alma Whitten wrote a paper called ‘Why Johnny Can’t Encrypt’ (PDF), covering why it was hard for people who were not security experts to use PGP 5.0.You could write the same paper today demonstrating why many security tools on the market in 2021 are just as hard to use.Developers aren’t necessarily security experts, even though the safety of their software – dispersed throughout applications and services we use every day – has major repercussions across industries and geographies. But burdening developers with a complex set of tools that require a high degree of security friction or prior knowledge can slow their progress and lead to workarounds, mistakes, or vulnerabilities in code.DON’T MISS Patchstack’s Oliver Sild on securing WordPress, one plugin vulnerability at a timeGood security should be baked directly into the development process and built with the experience of the developer in mind, not tacked on at the end. Platforms should focus on intentional design that balances usable account security with efficiency and speed as well as the ways developers want to work.This isn’t lowering the bar for security – it’s raising the bar for our expectations of the experience of security for the developer.You also said your priorities include “helping developers shift left” in line with your “developer-first security” ethos. How is GitHub helping facilitate this goal?MH: I’ll give two quick examples. First, GitHub Codespaces recently launched and we’ve moved nearly all of our internal development to this new platform.From a developer experience standpoint, it’s incredible to be able to have an ultra-fast development environment in the cloud within seconds, ready to go.From a security perspective, it’s actually equally remarkable when you think about the fact that you’re no longer worried about potentially tens of thousands of unique physical endpoints, in various states of security hygiene, all with different and heavily customized local environments, and each as a vector for potential attack on a local checkout.INTERVIEW Apache Software Foundation custodians on fulfilling the organization’s founding missionThis has traditionally been a really challenging set of problems related to endpoint security and the impact of that on locally-developed code, but Codespaces means you’re actually abstracting away a non-trivial part of that traditional, local attack surface.We also have GitHub Advanced Security, our suite of security products and features that integrate directly into the developer workflow, helping to shift security left.I’m personally very excited about CodeQL, the underlying code analysis engine behind GitHub code scanning, and the work we’re doing there to make it easier for people to discover and prevent vulnerable code from ever shipping.GitHub HQ in San Francisco, CaliforniaHow can the open source community address the growing problem of software supply chain attacks?MH: We’ve made a number of tools available for free to the open source community that can help improve the state of security in their organization and projects. There are hundreds of millions of open source projects on GitHub, and we feel that we have a responsibility to encourage and enable good security hygiene among builders by shipping security-first products.The company takes that responsibility seriously and is setting an industry standard, formulating tools like Dependabot and Dependency Review with the right amount of ease and friction to make it simple for software developers to do the same in their own projects.Increased collaboration is crucial as well, and is why we’re also partnering with other industry leaders to support the Open Source Security Foundation, with our latest participation in a $10 million funding announcement.There’s an axiom that nothing is ever 100% secure, while security threats are myriad and hard to anticipate/predict. How do you triage your resources to prioritize actions that bolster your security posture and help developers secure their codebase?MH: I like to think about this in the context of Forrester’s Targeted-Attack Hierarchy of Needs pyramid. Many organizations start at the top, where there’s a lot of interesting action and excitement, but they do that before they have the base of the pyramid – a clear strategy, a focus on developing and retaining talent, and focusing on brilliance at the basics and fundamentals of security.If you excel at these foundational layers of the pyramid, not only do the higher order activities become more effective and valuable, but you’re also likely dramatically increasing the attack cost for adversaries across the board by mastering the basics, which so often are neglected, leaving the proverbial front door open for whomever wants to walk in.RECOMMENDED Aaron Portnoy – ‘There’s no silver bullet for ransomware or supply chain attacks’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/focus-on-brilliance-at-the-basics-github-cso-mike-hanley-on-shifting-left-and-securing-the-software-supply-chain,"['GitHub', 'Interviews', 'DevSecOps', 'OpSec', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Microsoft', 'Cisco', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Analysis', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Compliance', 'Encryption', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Network', 'Security']"
no,US federal agencies ordered to patch hundreds of actively exploited vulnerabilities,CISA directive establishes tight patching deadlines,"US federal agencies have been ordered to establish a system for rapidly patching hundreds of known, exploited vulnerabilities.A directive from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) requires federal agencies to review and update vulnerability management procedures within 60 days.They will each be required to “establish a process for ongoing remediation of vulnerabilities that CISA identifies”, focusing on a catalog of security flaws known to be under active attack.Rapid remediation effortIn cases where a patch was released last year or earlier and a related vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, agencies have a six-month deadline to complete patching.“All other vulnerabilities” (ie flaws with a CVE issued this year) need to be boxed off within two weeks in what’s set to become an ongoing rapid remediation effort. “These default timelines may be adjusted in the case of grave risk to the Federal Enterprise,” the CISA’s directive states.A catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities maintained by the CISA already runs to 300 items or so, including a few dozen discovered this year and several older exploited vulnerabilities dating back as far as 2016.Read more of the latest government-related security news and analysisTackling this to-do list seems sure to involve a great deal of work in security triage, patching, and remediation at multiple agencies in the run-up to Christmas. The directive also introduces tighter internal tracking and external reporting requirements, a recipe for plenty of overtime for federal sysadmins and their managers in the new year.The order applies to all software and hardware found on federal information systems, whether managed internally or hosted by third parties – an important consideration when government agencies, much like mainstream businesses, rely heavily on the cloud, outsourcing, and managed services.Where SolarWinds blowThe program is aimed at improving the security posture of US government agencies in the wake of the infamous SolarWinds supply chain attack.Attackers suspected of working for Russian intelligence compromised the update mechanism of Orion, SolarWinds’ enterprise network management software, and used this to plant malware on the systems of a subset of customers, with US federal agencies among those targeted.It’s not the first time federal government systems in the country have been successfully attacked. For instance, the US Office of Personnel Management data breach infamously exposed the records of 20 million government employees, including Social Security numbers and much more, back in 2015.Bug Bounty foundationsNews of the Biden order marks the latest step in the US government’s ongoing strategy of improving its security posture.Recent years have witnessed the launch of the ‘Hack the Pentagon’ and ‘Hack the Army’ series of bug bounty events.In a further attempt at protecting its immense attack surface, the US government launched its first federal civilian security vulnerability disclosure program in partnership with Bugcrowd in June.It has also taskedthe US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with creating guidelines that will guide the federal government’s approach to software procurement and security.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Lessons from the aviation sector after Biden mandates cyber-attack investigatory body",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/us-federal-agencies-ordered-to-patch-hundreds-of-actively-exploited-vulnerabilities,"['Vulnerabilities', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Government', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks']"
no,Majority of consumer IoT vendors still lack vulnerability disclosure programs – report,Dismal findings appear to vindicate global efforts to regulate the sector,"Most consumer Internet of Things (IoT) vendors are still failing to provide clear mechanisms for disclosing security vulnerabilities, a damning new report has revealed.Researchers from UK IoT security firm Copper Horse found that only 21.6% of companies marketing consumer IoT devices appear to have a vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) in place.A VDP provides researchers with guidelines on how to submit security vulnerabilities to a given organization, sometimes including ‘safe harbor’ statements to protect them from legal repercussions. Unlike bug bounty programs, VDPs offer no financial incentives.This “glacial” progress made in the IoT sector’s adoption of VDPs – last year the figure was 18.9% – means that nearly four out of five companies “are still failing to provide the very basic security hygiene mechanism to allow security vulnerabilities to be reported to vendors so they can be fixed,” according to the report (PDF), published today (November 4) by the IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF).Catch up on the latest IoT security news and analysisThis means many product vendors are potentially in violation of IoT regulations and codes of practice in place or in the pipeline in the EU, UK, US, France, Singapore, India, and Australia.Introduced to the study for the first time, a small number of B2B vendors performed much better, with 71.4% of the 49 organizations having a VDP of some sort.Tech giants excel (comparatively)Just 6.7% of 315 consumer vendors analysed also give security researchers who report bugs status updates and resolution timelines, the IoTSF report’s fourth edition found.This ‘extended threshold’ for VDP best practices was mostly exceeded by tech giants, such as Google, Microsoft, Siemens, LG, and Xiaomi.Two thirds of VDPs (67.6%) included coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD), where researchers are publicly credited, involved in remediation, and permitted to disclose flaws post-remediation.Another 7.4% keep the process in-house, while the ‘other’ 25% include those advertising a formal security contact but no actual policy.Some 23.5% of VDPs are operated by a third-party provider, most frequently HackerOne or Bugcrowd, and 30.9% are accompanied by a bug bounty program.Slash securityAdoption of two widely recommended reporting mechanisms was also low: 5.4% for the /security website URL convention and 2.9% for security.txt.An isolated positive trend was the year-on-year rise in the proportion of firms with a formal reporting system that provided a PGP key to encrypt communication with researchers – up to 71.8% from 45%.RECOMMENDED Mitre-for-malware project MalAPI seeks community supportResearchers observed that some companies with VDPs in 2020 had since ceased advertising program details on their website, including Dyson and Tile.Smart TVs, networking devices, and smart hubs and were the most likely to have VDPs; smart lighting, environmental control, and health and fitness device vendors were the worst offenders.Market failureOnly 9% of European vendors have a VDP in place, compared to 24.3% of their North American counterparts and 29.5% in Asia.“Considering IoT standards and regulatory aspects have been discussed in Europe for a while you would expect there to be a greater degree of awareness,” David Rogers, Copper Horse CEO and a researcher on the study, told The Daily Swig.“To me, it is more evidence that the market has failed and this is why there is a need for regulatory intervention.”Non-tech companies that buy “white-labelled products and brand them as their own” raise questions about trust and pose “a big challenge for regulatory enforcement”, he added.The report also noted that several IoT providers prohibit or discourage disassembly and tampering in their devices’ terms of use – creating a potential chilling effect on good-faith security research.“It’s difficult to overstate the importance of having a vulnerability disclosure program to all IoT vendors,” said John Moor, IoTSF’s managing director. “There really is no excuse for ignorance – especially as regulatory demands around the world are looking to mandate this very soon.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/majority-of-consumer-iot-vendors-still-lack-vulnerability-disclosure-programs-report,"['IoT', 'Vulnerabilities', 'VDP', 'Research', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Privacy', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hardware', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Compliance', 'Mobile', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Europe', 'North', 'America', 'Asia', 'US', 'China', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Google', 'Microsoft']"
no,"Remote code execution, SQL injection bugs uncovered in Pentaho Business Analytics software",Penetration test reveals severe issues in Hitachi Vantara’s business solution,"UPDATED Critical bugs have been unearthed in Hitachi Vantara’s Pentaho Business Analytics software, a report has warned.A penetration test report, finalized on April 4 and cleared for public release on October 10, revealed a number of security issues in version 9.1.00 of the software on the Windows 64-bit operating system.Pentaho Business Analytics (BA) is an analytics platform for Big Data management. The enterprise solution is designed to discover, analyze, and visualize data across channels including databases, social media, cloud repositories, and NoSQL systems. BA can be deployed either on-premesis or in the cloud.Read more of the latest news about security vulnerabilitiesThe pen test was performed by Hawsec. The company says the security assessment was focused on the examination of “functional as well as source code aspects (where such code could be obtained, e.g, through decompilation), and [to] identify potential vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of the application and its underlying system”.The report (PDF), authored by Hawsec CEO Alberto Favero and cybersecurity researcher Altion Malka, outlines a total of six vulnerabilities, two of which are deemed critical and managed to achieve incredibly high CVSS scores of 9.9 and 9.8, respectively.FindingsThe first and most serious vulnerability of note is a remote code execution (RCE) flaw. Tracked as CVE-2021-31599 (with a CVSS score of 9.9), the bug allows low-privilege users to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by deploying a crafted, malicious Pentaho Report Bundle.The second critical bug, CVE-2021-34684 (CVSS 9.8), is an unauthenticated SQL injection issue found in BA’s query functionality. Unauthenticated users could exploit the flaw by executing arbitrary SQL queries on Pentaho data sources, thereby retrieving information from related databases without permission.In addition, Hawsec’s report documents four other vulnerabilities. The most notable is CVE-2021-31601, issued a CVSS score of 7.1 (high), which allows low-privilege attackers to extract configuration data from the application due to insufficient access controls.Hawsec also reported CVE-2021-31602 (CVSS 5.3) and CVE-2021-34685 (CVSS 2.7), an authentication bypass related to Spring API endpoints and a filename restriction bypass, respectively.MitigationsThe researcher also found another bug – which has not been issued a CVE tracker – that could allow low-privilege users to extract lists of application users from the platform’s Jackrabbit User Repository.Hawsec has provided the vendor with remediation options which can be found in the document.A spokesperson for Hitachi Vantara told The Daily Swig: “I can confirm we worked closely with the researchers mentioned, and addressed in the June 2021 release of Pentaho 9.2 five critical and medium vulnerabilities they highlighted.“The remaining low Severity (CVSS 2.7) issue (CVE-2021-34685) will also be addressed in the next release of Pentaho, which we expect to make available this month.

Troops are reported to have opened fire, killing at least 11 and injuring hundreds more.Meanwhile, around 4pm local time that day, internet traffic dropped to almost zero and has stayed that way since, apart from a return of mobile service for about an hour, 35 hours after the initial disruption.“All mobile internet networks are completely cut off; some fixed-line networks are operating on a small scale to serve government departments,” Sudanese journalist and human rights activist Hassan Ahmed Berkia tells The Daily Swig.“The military forces are giving orders to employees of mobile phone companies under threat.”Digital blockadeWeb security and performance monitoring firm Cloudflare says the drop in traffic was sudden and unusual, and that it has affected all the major internet service providers (ISPs) in Sudan.“Shutting down the internet is not as hard as people might imagine,” Cloudflare’s director of engineering, Celso Martinho, tells The Daily Swig.“The government can order the local ISPs to stop peering traffic to other entities outside the country. If the ISPs comply, all they need to do is to stop announcing their routes to the outside internet; turning the internet off is a simple configuration change.”RECOMMENDED Mauritian government’s plan to intercept web traffic marks ‘death knell for freedom of speech’Meanwhile, security research firm Comparitech says it has noted a sharp increase in searches for virtual private networks (VPNs) within the country since the initial shutdown.“During a shutdown, even software and services designed to bypass censorship, such as VPNs and other proxies, will be ineffective,” says Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech.“However, as the internet starts to come back online, residents of Sudan should be prepared for online censorship.Bischoff added: “Protestors can also consider using mesh networking apps to organise and communicate. Mesh networking apps typically use Bluetooth to connect devices over short distances so they can communicate even without access to the internet. For example, Bridgefy was recently used by protestors in Hong Kong.”Sudan: A history of internet blackoutsSudan has a long history of internet shutdowns. In December 2018, following protests calling for al-Bashir to step down, access was cut off for 68 days. Another mobile internet shutdown in the summer of 2019 lasted for 36 days.Elsewhere in Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Togo, Burundi, Chad, Mali, Nigeria, and Guinea all also restricted access to the internet or social media applications at some point during 2020.“Shutting down the internet while a military coup is unveiling and protesters are out on the street is a clear sign that someone is trying to cover up something,” says Felicia Anthonio, campaigner and #KeepItOn lead at campaign group Access Now.Read more of the latest cybersecurity news from Africa“After authorities met protests for democracy in 2019 with a complete internet shutdown, the world was shocked by the atrocities that were perpetrated against the Sudanese people, and a return to this tactic is a major warning sign of what could follow.”International pressure on Sudan is increasing, with the UAE, the US, Saudi Arabia, and the UK calling for an immediate restoration of the civilian government.

Yes,Mozilla debuts Site Isolation technology with Firefox update,Sandboxing technology levels up browser security,"Mozilla is offering improved security controls for Firefox users with the debut of a long-anticipated version of Site Isolation technology.Bundled in the release of Firefox 94, released on Tuesday (November 2), Mozilla’s Site Isolation offers protection from side-channel attacks, such as Spectre, through a form of process sandboxing technology.More generally, Site Isolation technology defends against compromised browser rendering processes and related security risks.Catch up on the latest browser-related security news and analysisShared renderer processes have been considered risky since 2018’s discovery of transient execution attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown, which can leak sensitive data including passwords and credentials via microarchitecture state.The same security enhancement technology can also defend against problems arising from universal cross-site scripting (UXSS) vulnerabilities.Using Site Isolation technology means that documents from different websites are no longer rendered by the same process – a clear security win.Mozilla’s version of Site Isolation technology was originally announced back in May. Other browser developers, meanwhile, have also been busy charting a similar course with Site Isolation technology.For example, Google first introduced a Site Isolation browser architecture in May 2018 with Chrome 67. The technology has been progressively developed since and has been ported to mobile browsers among other developments.The latest iterations of Microsoft Edge’s browser are based on Google Chromium engine and therefore inherit the same underlying Site Isolation technology developed by Google.Apple’s Safari is yet to incorporate Site Isolation, as such, but it does have a technology called Intelligent Tracking Protection that guards against session tokens being leaked.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Google, Mozilla close to finalizing Sanitizer API for Chrome and Firefox browsers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/mozilla-debuts-site-isolation-technology-with-firefox-update,"['Browsers', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Mozilla', 'firefox', 'Google', 'Chrome', 'Microsoft', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'XSS', 'Industry', 'News', 'Side-channel', 'Privacy']"
Yes,Dangerous XSS bug in Google Chrome’s ‘New Tab’ page bypassed security features,‘Chrome’s New Tab page only has a really weak CSP that doesn’t mitigate XSS’,"UPDATED The Chromium team has patched a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allowed attackers to run arbitrary JavaScript code on Chrome’s ‘New Tab’ page.According to a discussion thread and proof-of-concept on the Chromium bug portal, an attacker can exploit the bug by sending a HTML file to the victim that contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which sends a malicious JavaScript code snippet as a search query to Google.RELATED Google, Mozilla close to finalizing Sanitizer API for Chrome, Firefox browsersWhen the user opens the file, the CSRF script runs and the query is stored in the browser’s search history. The next time the user opens a New Tab Page and clicks on the Google search bar, the malicious code is triggered.Alarmingly, if the victim was logged into their Google account when opening the malicious file, the request will be saved to their account’s search history and triggered on any other device where their Google account is logged in.Hacking the New Tab pageAshish Dhone, the researcher who discovered the bug, has a track record of hunting XSS bugs in Google web and mobile applications. “I wanted to find XSS in Chrome, hence my hunting started with the desktop application of Google Chrome,” he told The Daily Swig.“I was looking for HTML markup functionality where XSS can be executed. After spending hours, somehow I found that in New Tab page, stored search queries are not sanitized and then I was able to execute [the uXSS]”.UXSS attacks exploit client-side vulnerabilities in a browser or browser extensions in order to generate an XSS condition and execute malicious code.“When such vulnerabilities are found and exploited, the behavior of the browser is affected and its security features may be bypassed or disabled,” Dhone explains.Hacking the IPC channelWhile the bug is dangerous, other researchers have pointed out that it is not a uXSS. “This XSS is a classic DOM-based XSS, where user-controlled text is assigned as an HTML using innerHTML,” security researcher Jun Kokatsu told The Daily Swig.Chrome’s New Tab page exposes Mojo.JS bindings that can send inter-process communication (IPC) messages to the browser through JavaScript code. The XSS bug could abuse this IPC channel to exploit a bug in the browser process, which executes at a much higher privilege than code running in web pages.Read more of the latest browser security news“Usually, getting control over sending arbitrary IPC requires native code execution in the renderer process such as memory corruption bugs in the JS engine,” Kokatsu said. “However, because the IPC channel was exposed to JS directly in New Tab page, the XSS in Chrome’s NTP can be treated as the equivalent of renderer process RCE.”Limited to ChromeMost Chromium-based browsers have their own implementation of New Tab page, so the bug doesn’t affect all browsers, Kokatsu said, adding that Edge was not vulnerable to the attack.“The XSS could have been mitigated using Content Security Policy (CSP) and/or Trusted Types,” Kokatsu said. “Chrome’s New Tab page only has a really weak CSP that doesn’t mitigate XSS (i.e., script-src ‘unsafe-inline’).”Dhone took away a $1,000 bug bounty reward for the discovery as well as some important lessons about browser security. “Always check for the features and functionality where HTML markup is used – this is where most XSS attacks can be found and exploited,” he said.This article has been updated to reflect the lack of consensus around whether this is a universal XSS vulnerability.This article was updated again on November 19, 2021, this time to remove the ‘NTP’ acronym that some in the tech community were confusing with the Network Timing Protocol.RECOMMENDED Japanese punctuation exacerbates privacy flaw that leaks search terms in Google, Firefox browsers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/dangerous-xss-bug-in-google-chromes-new-tab-page-bypassed-security-features,"['Chrome', 'Browsers', 'XSS', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Google', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'CSRF', 'RCE', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Phishing', 'Research', 'JavaScript', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News']"

My advice to those that have fallen victim is to ensure that there are no other Sitecore servers they are operating that have the Report.ashx file available.“Often companies deploy multiple instances of Sitecore, and they must all be remediated for this vulnerability. Alternatively, upgrading to a later Sitecore version (10.x) could also bring great security benefits including this bug being patched.”MitigationsThe vulnerability is pending a CVE number but is being tracked by the vendor as SC2021-003-499266.It impacts all Sitecore systems running affected versions, including single-instance and multi-instance environments, managed cloud environments, and all Sitecore server roles (content delivery, content editing, reporting, processing, etc), which are exposed to the internet.To remediate the problem, Assetnote advised users to “simply remove the Report.ashx file from /sitecore/shell/ClientBin/Reporting/”, and pointed to Sitecore’s security advisory.Sitecore has advised users to upgrade to version 9.0.0 or higher which protects against the vulnerability.This article has been updated to include comment from Assetnote.DON’T MISS Discourse fixes critical validation-related vulnerability in forum software",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/rce-vulnerability-found-in-sitecore-enterprise-cms-software,"['RCE', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Enterprise', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Research', 'Australia', 'Oceania', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Privacy']"
no,NIST unveils draft criteria for ‘seal of approval’ scheme on consumer software security,"Baseline standards proposed for secure development, handling vulnerabilities, and protecting sensitive data","The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released draft criteria for a cybersecurity labeling system focused on consumer software.Released for public comment yesterday (November 1), the proposals (PDF) set out baseline security standards that vendors would have to meet to earn certification under any future scheme.This would include demonstrating software integrity and provenance, the absence of known vulnerabilities and hardcoded secrets, and, where applicable, multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong cryptography.Read more of the latest cybersecurity policy and legislation news and analysisVendors would also need to adhere to best practices around secure development, vulnerability reporting and remediation, end-of-life dates, and data protection.“The goal is to raise consumers’ awareness about the various security needs they might have and to help them make informed choices about the software they purchase and use,” said Michael Ogata, NIST computer scientist and co-author of the document.IoT counterpartThe proposals complement equivalent criteria released at the end of August for Internet of Things (IoT) devices (PDF), with both projects mandated by the cybersecurity-focused executive order issued by President Biden in May.NIST, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other agencies, was tasked by the executive order with initiating “pilot programs informed by existing consumer product labeling programs to educate the public on the security capabilities of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and software development practices, and shall consider ways to incentivize manufacturers and developers to participate in these programs”.A news release from NIST reflects on the challenges of reconciling the aim of conveying security assurances to customers “simply and directly” with the fact that “there is no one-size-fits-all approach to cybersecurity that can be applied to all types of consumer software”.RELATED NIST charts course towards more secure supply chains for government softwareWhile the executive order suggested that “a tiered software security rating system” should be considered, NIST proposes a simpler, binary label – or ‘seal of approval’ – that simply indicates whether a product has met a baseline standard.This would make it more like Finland’s IoT cybersecurity label than Singapore’s equivalent regime, which classifies IoT devices using a ratings scale.However, NIST suggests that customers could also have the option of clicking on a URL to discover additional details about the labelling scheme and the software’s declaration of conformity.Expert responseTim Mackey, principal security strategist at the Synopsys CyRC (Cybersecurity Research Center), tells The Daily Swig: “At the core of all labelling schemes is an attestation that the software was developed and tested to known norms and that it’s free from known vulnerabilities at the point of shipment.“While this information is valuable to the public consumer, its impact will be better realized within enterprise and industry. Where an individual might purchase a single unit of a device like a security camera, the average business likely has dozens of them – each an appealing target for cybercriminals. Mackey adds: “If the contents of the attestation are incorporated into the procurement processes business use for such a device, then more vendors will comply with the labelling requirements, which would limit the market for non-compliant devices – ultimately reducing the number of potentially vulnerable businesses attackers might successfully compromise.”NIST reiterated that it would not be setting up a labeling program itself, since the executive order calls for a voluntary approach, adding that it “will be up to the marketplace to determine which organizations might use cybersecurity labels”.Members of the general public can submit their responses to the draft document until December 16.NIST plans to produce final versions for both consumer software and IoT devices by February 6, 2022.RECOMMENDED All Day DevOps 2021: Securing the software supply chain with ephemerality and the least-privilege principle",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nist-unveils-draft-criteria-for-seal-of-approval-scheme-on-consumer-software-security,"['US', 'Government', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'North', 'America', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Encryption', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'IoT', 'Authentication', '2FA', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Hardware', 'VDP']"
no,Mitre-for-malware project MalAPI seeks community support,Windows malware cataloged by API calls,"A newly launched project aims to catalog Windows malware samples based on the APIs the malicious code relies upon.MalAPI.io, was created by a security researcher with the handle mr.d0x to offer a different perspective on malicious code by cataloging malware through how it works, instead of through a process of reverse engineering.The researcher is trawling through malware source code written in C/C++ that utilizes WinAPIs and categorizing them.The aim is to create a resource that mr.d0x said will be useful to both security researchers and pen testers.RELATED Cloud security: Microsoft launches ATT&CK-inspired matrix for Kubernetes“This project can be helpful for ones developing (for legal purposes) or reverse-engineering malware,” mr.d0x told The Daily Swig.“You can turn mapping mode on which allows you to highlight the APIs used, and when you’re done simply click ‘export table’ to download an image of the table.”“With this approach, people are able to discover what the Windows APIs do from a security perspective. There’s no real place out there that shows what Windows APIs can be used for from this perspective,” according to mr.d0x.Dewey DigitalThe MalAPI.io project launched on October 31, to positive initial responses from other security researchers on Twitter.In the same way that projects including the Mitre ATT&CK Framework can be used to map a network-based assault, MalAPI.io might lend itself to charting attacks based on malicious code.For now, the project is still only in its early stage and far from complete. Its creator is currently seeking to engage other members of the infosec community to get involved in the project.“I am looking to get the community involved in this because there's tons of APIs out there, some that I may not even know about,” mr.d0x explained. “With people contributing we can make this [MalAPI.io] a centralized place where everyone can go for knowledge about Windows APIs.”Read more of the latest infosec research news from around the worldThe security researcher expressed the hope that the project might lead onto the development of better security defences.“I see it as being beneficial to almost everyone in the infosec community, whether you simply want to learn or if you're doing security-related work,” mr.d0x said.“For example, pen testers or red teamers can use this to find APIs to use during an engagement if they're building a binary.“Security researchers working at AV/EDR [antivirus/ end-point detection and response] companies can use the list of APIs to create better detection rules.

no,Multiple flaws in telecoms stack software FreeSwitch uncovered,Authentication and denial of service risks for DIY PBX tech patched,"UPDATED Security researchers have gone public about a set of five vulnerabilities in telecoms stack software FreeSwitch.The quintet of flaws – all discovered by a team from German telecoms security consultancy Enable Security – lead to denial of service, authentication problems and information leakage for systems running FreeSwich.FreeSwitch is an open source, software-defined telecoms stack that allows multi-purpose devices, ranging from a Raspberry-Pi to multi-core servers, to act as telecoms switches.Enable Security worked with developers so that all five flaws were fixed with FreeSwitch 1.10.7, released on October 25.Hanging on the telephoneThe various flaws involve services related to providing WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), a technology that allows audio and video communication within web pages without the need to install plugins, as well as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), a signalling and control protocol used in IP telephony and elsewhere.The first vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2021-41105, with a CVSS Score of 7.5) makes it possible for an attacker to disconnect any ongoing calls by flooding a FreeSwitch installation with invalid SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) packets.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Video conferencing platforms must improve privacy for users, data authorities warnNo authentication is required to trigger this denial of service, which works by preventing a FreeSwitch install from unpacking encrypted data and authentication traffic packed up using SRTP.Another high-severity flaw (CVE-2021-41145, CVSS score 8.6) leaves FreeSwitch at risk of denial of service through SIP flooding. Memory on a device can be exhausted if an attack targets a switch with enough junk SIP messages.As with the previous flaw, no authentication is required.A third high severity vulnerability (CVE-2021-37624) stemmed from shortcomings in how FreeSwitch authenticated SIP message requests.By default, SIP ‘MESSAGE’ requests are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSwitch – opening the door to spam and message spoofing.Hotline leaksA lesser, moderate severity flaw (CVE-2021-41158) means that miscreants can carry out a SIP digest leak attack against FreeSwitch and receive the challenge response of a gateway configured on the FreeSwitch server. This leaked data might be used to determine a gateway password.Lastly, a failure of previous versions of FreeSwitch to authenticate SIP ‘SUBSCRIBE’ requests, which are used to subscribe to user agent event notifications, created a moderate privacy risk.Businesses running the affected software should patch their systems or risk being compromised.In a technical blog post, Enable Security explains these various vulnerabilities in more depth. Each of the vulnerabilities is of varying impact.Sandro Gauci, the researcher who led the team at Enable Security which carried out the research, told The Daily Swig: ""Each vulnerability has a different impact. The worst one is the DoS due to SIP flood since in RTC downtime is a huge deal.""Estimates of how many systems might be vulnerable are tricky to come by but what's clear is that thousands of systems are at risk.Gauci, the self-styled chief mischief maker at Enable Security, said: ""[It's] hard for me to say how many are affected. Shodan shows > 12k FreeSwitch servers listening on port 5060. There will be more with a custom User-Agent header. And various systems will be internal / not responding to Shodan / hiding behind an SIP router / SBC etc.""Gauci concluded by expressing that hope that Enable's work might inspire other researchers to look into the security of WebRTC and IP telephony systems.""We've been advocating for more security research / testing in the area because many security professionals seem to ignore the topic,"" Gauci said, adding that the ""FreeSwitch developers were very receptive and we were happy to work with them on these issues"".This story was updated to add comment from Enable SecurityDON’T FORGET TO READ ‘Professional cybercriminals’ blamed for DDoS attacks against UK telecoms providers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/multiple-flaws-in-telecoms-stack-software-freeswitch-uncovered,"['Telecommunications', 'Research', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Authentication', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Privacy', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Organizations', 'Hardware', 'Industry', 'News']"
No,Bug Bounty Radar // The latest bug bounty programs for November 2021,New web targets for the discerning hacker,"We kick off this month’s bug bounty roundup with some dramatic payout news – a record $2 million paid by blockchain technology company Polygon for a ‘double spend’ smart contract vulnerability.The flaw, discovered by ethical hacker Gerhard Wagner, would have enabled an attacker to double the amount of cryptocurrency they intend to withdraw up to 233 times. In this way, a deposit of just $4,500 could have allowed a hacker to withdraw $1 million.“The opportunities in crypto as a hacker are tremendous,” says Wagner. “I predict we will see high, single-digit, million dollar bounties announced from projects and white hats claiming them in a not-too-distant future.”Meanwhile, a newly launched bug bounty platform in India is encouraging cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts to sign up, and is promising free training and access to exclusive programs for its top 100 ethical hackers.Cyber3ra, based in Nagpur, says the top three will also receive exclusive merchandising and early access to programs.Researchers ‘s1r1us’ and ‘BlackFan’ have documented prototype pollution vulnerabilities found in more than 1,000 popular websites and 18 widely used JavaScript libraries, including Apple.com, Jira Service Management, HubSpot Analytics, and Segment Analytics.The researchers believe that prototype pollution is being neglected: “We hope our blog gives more light to this attack surface and helps people mitigate these issues at scale,” they said.And finally, we caught up with YouTube educator and security expert Katie Paxton-Fear during a Q&A session we held on Twitter for our readers.She advises those at the start of their careers to play the field a little: “I think my biggest advice is not to get attached to one field right away, spend some time figuring out what about security really sparks joy for you,” she says.Katie recommends IDORs as a good area of focus for newbies: they’re one of the most common bugs, she says, and can be ‘high’ or ‘critical’ in severity.“[The] best way to find them is to sign up with two accounts and see if you can do actions to account A while using the cookies of account B,” she says.The latest bug bounty programs for October 2021The past month saw the arrival of several new bug bounty programs.

no,Ransomware cybercriminals linked to Norsk Hydro attack fall prey to Europol swoop,Two-year investigation results in raids targeting ‘high-value’ suspects and seizure of cash and computers,"A ransomware group that’s said to be responsible for thousands of “devastating” attacks against high-profile targets worldwide has been disrupted after a dozen prominent members were “targeted” by law enforcement, Europol has announced.Police also seized more than $52,000 in cash, five luxury vehicles, and electronic devices as they swooped on locations in Ukraine and Switzerland in the early hours of October 26.The electronic devices are being forensically examined in the hope of uncovering further evidence and investigative leads, said Europol in a press release.Norsk Hydro defianceThe EU’s law enforcement body said 12 individuals were targeted in relation to a “professional, highly organized” cybercrime group that favored large corporations and is believed to have directed attacks affecting more than 1,800 victims in 71 countries.As confirmed by Norwegian police, this includes a ransomware attack that crippled the IT systems of Norwegian industrial giant Norsk Hydro in 2019.Catch up on the latest ransomware-related news and analysisThe aluminum and renewable energy provider refused to pay the ransom despite having to operate without computer systems for several weeks.While the incident cost Norsk Hydro an estimated $70 million in losses, the company was widely praised for refusing to cave into the hackers’ demands, as well as its transparency in communicating the attack to its customers and the wider public.‘High-value targets’Some of the suspects “interrogated” in the Europol- and Eurojust-led operation are believed to have been involved in the compromise of corporate networks, while others are accused of overseeing the laundering of ransom payments using bitcoin mixing services.“Most of these suspects are considered high-value targets because they are being investigated in multiple high-profile cases in different jurisdictions,” said Europol.The ransomware gang breached IT networks via phishing emails, stolen credentials, brute force attacks, and the exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities, among other mechanisms, said Europol.Once inside networks the attackers moved laterally and deployed malware such as Trickbot or post-exploitation frameworks such as Cobalt Strike or PowerShell Empire.RELATED Trickbot: Russian national extradited to US for alleged role in developing notorious banking trojanEuropol said the attackers then probed for further weaknesses as they lurked undetected in compromised systems, often for several months.The group deployed ransomware variants including MegaCortex, Dharma and – as was the case with Norsk Hydro – LockerGoga.Victims were instructed to pay ransoms in bitcoin in exchange for decryption keys.The investigation, which began in September 2019, involved law enforcement authorities from France, Netherlands, Ukraine, UK, Germany, Switzerland, US, and Norway.RECOMMENDED Ransomware forensics research reveals cybercrime tradecraft secrets",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ransomware-cybercriminals-linked-to-norsk-hydro-attack-fall-prey-to-europol-swoop,"['Europol', 'Ransomware', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Network', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Database', 'Security', 'Phishing', 'Malware', 'Email', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Encryption', 'Legal', 'OpSec', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Enterprise', 'Switzerland', 'Norway', 'Netherlands', 'France', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'North', 'America', 'UK', 'US']"
no,All Day DevOps 2021: Securing the software supply chain with ephemerality and the least-privilege principle,‘The new boundary for systems engineering is how ephemeral can you make any given process with a privilege’,"“Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job,” said computer scientist Jerry Saltzer back in 1974.Nearly half a century later, and the principle of least privilege remains paramount in software development, James Watters, CTO for modern application platforms at VMware, told attendees at this year’s All Day DevOps.While managing risk is increasingly difficult to manage in diverse, multi-cloud environments, DevOps teams now have powerful technical means to adhere to the least-privilege model, he suggested.Automation and “fundamentally changing how runtime behaves” are all reducing overall system privilege in ways that were impossible back in the 1970s, said Watters, one of three speakers in the keynote session.Read more of the latest DevSecOps news and analysisKit Colbert, VMware’s senior VP and CTO, said the benefits extend beyond barring entry to bad actors, because well-intentioned developers inevitably make mistakes.The more you “structure [access control] in such a way that they can’t accidentally do something that exposes them to risk, the better”, he said.Colbert also noted how the “notion of user identity in the OS” does not really exist on the open internet (IP addresses don’t really count) – something the YubiKey addressed by retrofitting web programming with a “hardbound identity in a physical key”.Ephemeral buildsEphemerality was another recurring theme during the presentation.“The new boundary for systems engineering is how ephemeral can you make any given process with a privilege,” said Watters.“After Equifax everyone suddenly got even more hyper-aware of long-lived shared secrets that might be present in their system,” he added.RECOMMENDED US lawmakers back mandatory standards for transport and logistics cybersecurityAshok Banerjee, VP of engineering for security, compliance, and privacy at VMware, said ephemeral builds are particularly critical “because in production systems the actors typically do not persist malicious activities in the VM because we don’t patch yesterday’s VM”.He added: “We throw it away and build a new VM. So, they have to drift the configuration in some way. And ephemeral environments that get built from infrastructure-as-code do not allow that – so it’s a powerful tool”.Attacking the build pipelineFrom dependency confusion attacks against open source code to package mirror attacks against the software delivery phase, every layer of the CI/CD pipeline is under assault, said Bannerjee.But attacks in the intermediate phase – the build pipeline – might be more egregious than those targeting the source code system “because malicious actors do not like version history”.BACKGROUND Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowThe SolarWinds assailants, for instance, were better able to disguise their activities by swapping files on the build system.Attackers typically wait two weeks after initial incursions, he continued, “so you won’t correlate the new behavior with the product installation”.Observed Colbert: “Even if you repave weekly, you are still able to catch those and get them out of there before they can do any damage”.The butterfly effectAsked what they were most concerned about with the DevSecOps status quo, Bannerjee cited “patch flat-footedness – waiting 12 hours might be too long”.Watters was exercised by the downside of a one-to-many paradigm of code changes.“We’ve created this universe of cloud automation where small changes roll out to enormous numbers of machines that are not back-office systems they literally run our economy today,” he said.“The butterfly that flaps its wings in our software supply chain can cause hurricanes.”Fortunately, thanks to the Equifax and SolarWinds attacks in particular, the information security industry was now “making it one of the core engineering disciplines of modern software operations”.Watters spotlighted another promising development: pipelines’ “decomposition into personaes”, which “will democratize the DevOps approach” for organizations that otherwise would lack the human resources.Colbert, meanwhile, raised the prospect of architecturally eliminating whole classes of potential risks or vulnerabilities”. Do it right and it’s a “fundamental level of security” rather than just “playing whack a mole” against myriad threats, he said.RELATED Critical flaw in GoCD provides platform for supply chain attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/all-day-devops-2021-securing-the-software-supply-chain-with-ephemerality-and-the-least-privilege-principle,"['Events', 'DevSecOps', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Authentication', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DevOps', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Malware', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'OpSec', 'Passwords', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise']"

Later versions were adapted to facilitate the installation and use of ransomware.This summer, according to IBM, the gang boosted its network by signing up two new distribution affiliates. And in October, Check Point Software reported that Trickbot topped its September Global Threat Index as the most prevalent malware.RELATED Ransomware attacks more than doubled last year as cybercriminals scale up during pandemicThe indictment alleges that between November 2015 and August 2020, Dunaev and others stole money and confidential information from individuals, financial institutions, school districts, utility companies, government entities and private businesses.Stolen login credentials and other personal information were, says the DoJ, used to gain access to online bank accounts, execute unauthorized electronic funds transfers and launder the money through US and foreign accounts.Read more of the latest cybercrime newsDunaev is charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and multiple counts of wire fraud, bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft.If convicted of all counts, he faces a maximum penalty of 60 years’ imprisonment.Earlier this year, Latvian national Alla Witte, aka Max, 55, was charged with similar offences.

no,"Google, Salesforce, others team up to launch MVSP security baseline project",The collaboration is focused on creating a vendor-neutral security standard,"Industry giants including Google and Salesforce have announced the creation of a “vendor-neutral” security baseline for businesses.Dubbed the ‘Minimum Viable Secure Product’ (MVSP), Google’s Royal Hansen, vice president of security, said in a blog post on Wednesday that the scheme will establish “minimum acceptable security baselines” for corporations.In particular, the project will focus on securing business-to-business software developers and businesses that outsource to suppliers.According to research conducted by the Opus and the Ponemon Institute, 59% of US organizations say they have suffered a data breach caused by third parties, including their vendors.In a report published by ENISA on software supply chain attacks in Europe, 62% of incidents began with malware deployment, and more than 60% of attacks abused the trust of customers in their suppliers. In total, 58% of attacks reported were focused on data theft.Take actionThe MVSP baseline focuses on minimal standards considered to be necessary for a reasonable security posture. Its creators include Google, Salesforce, Okta, and Slack.To keep things simple, the group has adopted a checklist for users to work their way through, which includes:A website point of contact for vulnerability reportsResponses to vulnerability reports managed in a reasonable time periodAnnual penetration testingData sanitization based on NIST SP 800-88 or equivalentEstablishing minimally permissive Content Security PoliciesSecure backupsBy creating a base standard that organizations are expected to keep – no matter which cybersecurity solutions they adopt or who their favorite vendors are – this could ramp up the pressure on companies to maintain adequate security levels in order to remain competitive and to be considered suitable for future business relationships.MVSP “highlight[s] opportunities for improvement and [can] raise their visibility within the organization, with clearly defined benefits,” the executive commented.Read more about the latest software supply chain attacksHansen added that these controls could also reduce the complexity around contracts, legal negotiations, and compliance.“We recommend that all companies building B2B software or otherwise handling sensitive information under its broadest definition implement the listed controls and are strongly encouraged to go well beyond them in their security programs,” the coalition states.Google and the other project members have also asked for community feedback and for contributions to the MVSP baseline.“Together we can raise the minimum bar for security across the industry and make everyone safer,” Hansen added.CATCH UP Critical flaw in GoCD provides platform for supply chain attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-salesforce-others-team-up-to-launch-mvsp-security-baseline-project,"['Industry', 'News', 'US', 'Secure', 'Development', 'North', 'America', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Google', 'Research', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Organizations', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Compliance', 'Europe', 'Malware']"
no,‘Inaction isn’t an option’ – US lawmakers back mandatory standards for transport and logistics cybersecurity,"House Committee on Homeland Security hearing pulls focus on securing ‘planes, trains, and pipelines’","US lawmakers are calling for mandatory cybersecurity measures for the transport and logistics sector, in the wake of an increase in ransomware and other cyber-attacks.A hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security this week – Transportation Cybersecurity: Protecting planes, trains, and pipelines from cyber threats – heard that transport, including aviation, rail, shipping and ports, is increasingly being targeted by criminal hackers.Following the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack over the summer, members of congress are calling on owners and operators of critical national infrastructure to increase protection of their IT systems.RELATED Colonial Pipeline cyber-attack: US authorities seize $2.3m in DarkSide ransomware paymentsCybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation Subcommittee chairwoman Yvette Clarke told the hearing: “Shocked by what we learned during their oversight of Colonial Pipeline and other recent high-profile cyber incidents, members of congress have begun to question whether the federal government’s approach to cybersecurity – which relies primarily on voluntary partnerships – actually works, or whether some security requirements ought to be mandated.”The congresswoman pointed out that cybersecurity mandates are not new, and that mandates were issued to critical infrastructure operators by then President Obama, under Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. But transport security has continued to be on a voluntary basis.That, she said, poses risks to transport systems and above all, to their users. So, the move by the TSA to mandate requirements marks “a pivotal transition in the federal government’s approach to cybersecurity”.When the gas stops flowingTransportation and Maritime Security Subcommittee chairwoman Bonnie Watson Coleman told the hearing: “I want to be crystal clear: when it comes to transportation cybersecurity, inaction isn’t an option. When gas stops flowing due to a cyber-attack, it doesn’t just impact the pipeline’s owner – it means Americans struggle to fill up their tanks.“If hackers succeed in bringing down a plane or derailing a train, it’s not an airline or railroad that would pay the steepest price. The real cost would be borne by the passengers injured or killed.”But, she said, most transportation operators “currently have no obligation” to meet even baseline cybersecurity standards. She told the hearing that, in recent months, attackers have targeted New York’s public transport authority, the Massachusetts ferry system, and the Port of Houston, Texas.Read more of the latest critical infrastructure security news from around the worldEarlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced new requirements for higher-risk rail and aviation operators. These include mandatory reporting of incidents to CISA, for organizations to identify a security co-ordinator, and to put in place a cybersecurity incident recovery plan. This is set to be followed by a security directive in spring 2022.Subcommittee chairwoman Bonnie Watson Coleman also warned that higher security standards should apply to “all transportation modes”, especially with the growth in connected and autonomous vehicles. And the US Coastguard needs to enforce cybersecurity standards within its domain of ferries, ports, and maritime systems.More collaboration neededWitnesses to the hearing pointed out that better cooperation and collaboration is needed, both between operators and between government agencies. Sometimes security co-operation is made harder by duplication among federal and other government agencies, it was claimed.Witnesses called included Suzanne Spaulding, senior adviser at Homeland Security International Security Program, Center for Strategic and International Studies; Patricia Cogswell, strategic advisor at Guidehouse and former deputy administrator for the Transportation Security Administration; Jeffrey Troy, president and CEO of the Aviation Information Sharing and Analysis Center; and Scott Dickerson, executive director at the Maritime Transportation System Information Sharing and Analysis Center.The US transport and logistics sector has suffered dozens of cyber-attacks over recent months“First, the purely voluntary approach simply has not gotten us to where we need to be, despite decades of effort,” acknowledged Ms Spaulding.“The threat is evolving much more quickly than our defense, even in these key sectors where there has been significant progress on cyber, there is still a need to ensure continued investment across all vital assets.”“The cyber risks to the aviation industry have increased,” added AISAC’s Jeffrey Troy. “Together, both private industry and the public sector that significantly increased cooperation in threat intelligence and best practices and now’s the time for industry and government to partner even more closely in creating and enhancing effective cyber risk reduction frameworks.”RECOMMENDED Ransom Disclosure Act: US bill mandates organizations to report ransomware paymentsCybersecurity professionals welcomed the House Committee’s focus on the threat to transport systems.“There is no question that securing the nation’s critical infrastructure from cyber threats is of paramount importance to maintaining safety as well as the economy,” Tara Wisniewski, executive vice president of advocacy, global markets, and member engagement at infosec non-profit (ISC)² told The Daily Swig.“When (ISC)² recently polled cybersecurity professionals, two-thirds cited a need for state and federal-funded cybersecurity measures, while 57% specifically called for government mandates and enforcement of minimum cybersecurity standards.“The key to establishing and maintaining those standards is education and professional development, which needs to be mandated side-by-side with technology and other best practice measures… To do so ensures a clear and repeatable benchmark for competence while maintaining readiness among the very professionals charged with protecting key infrastructure and services.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/inaction-isnt-an-option-us-lawmakers-back-mandatory-standards-for-transport-and-logistics-cybersecurity,"['US', 'Logistics', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Ransomware', 'Malware', 'Cybercrime', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'North', 'America', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Analysis', 'Government', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Organizations', 'Maritime', 'Secure', 'Development']"
no,WordPress plugin vulnerability opened up one million sites to remote takeover,Gaping OptinMonster security hole patched,"Vulnerabilities in OptinMonster, an email marketing plugin for WordPress, left more than a million websites open to exploitation, security researchers at Wordfence warn.Left unaddressed, the flaws make it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to export sensitive information and add malicious JavaScript to vulnerable WordPress sites, among other exploits.The Wordfence Threat Intelligence team notified developers of the plugin about the problem on September 28. A fully patched edition of OptinMonster, version 2.6.5, was released on October 7.Wordfence went public with a security advisory detailing its findings on Wednesday (October 27).Monster-in-the-MiddleOptinMonster is designed to help website owners to generate eCommerce leads and create sales campaigns on WordPress sites. The software that makes heavy use of API endpoints to provide integration.This feature, security researchers at Wordfence discovered, is something of a weak spot for the technology:The majority of the REST-API endpoints were insecurely implemented, making it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access many of the various endpoints on sites running a vulnerable version of the plugin.The most critical of the REST-API endpoints was the /wp-json/omapp/v1/support endpoint, which disclosed sensitive data like the site’s full path on the server, along with the API key needed to make requests on the OptinMonster site.With access to the API key, an attacker could make changes to any campaign associated with a site’s connected OptinMonster account and add malicious JavaScript that would execute anytime a campaign was displayed on the exploited site.In addition to the /wp-json/omapp/v1/support endpoint, nearly every other REST-API endpoint registered in the plugin was vulnerable to authorization bypass due to insufficient capability checking, the Wordfence researchers said.A further flaw made it possible for unauthenticated attackers – in practice any modestly technically miscreant who visited a WordPress site – to compromise the software without any login credentials.Catch up on the latest WordPress security newsThe issue stems from problems with the logged_in_or_has_api_key function.Fortunately, the “OptinMonster team invalidated all API keys to force site owners to generate new keys in the off chance that a key had been previously compromised” as an added precaution as well as updating the plugin software, according to Wordfence.According to that latest stats from the WordPress plugin store, nearly a quarter (23.6%) of the one million OptinMonster are running badly outdated builds. The remaining figure accounts for all installations in the 2.6 branch, all of which below 2.6.5 remain insecure.There no more granular breakdown on the number of sites that have already upgraded to 2.6.5 or the latest 2.6.6 version of OptinMonster - so the exact percentage of vulnerable installs remains unclear.Any users of OptinMonster are strongly urged to update to the latest, patched version of the plugin (2.6.5 or above) regardless of whatever secondary security protection they might have in order to guard themselves against potential attack.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Injection flaws in popular WordPress plugin could expose credentials, allow admin access",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/wordpress-plugin-vulnerability-opened-up-one-million-sites-to-remote-takeover,"['WordPress', 'Vulnerabilities', 'JavaScript', 'API', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Compliance', 'VDP', 'Email', 'Security', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'WAF', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Data', 'Leak', 'XSS']"
no,Critical flaw in GoCD provides platform for supply chain attacks,Vulnerability in software used by Fortune 500 firms raises fears of SolarWinds-like impact,"UPDATED A critical vulnerability in popular CI/CD tool GoCD could allow unauthenticated attackers to extract encrypted secrets and poison software build processes – potentially paving the way to supply chain attacks.The maintainers of the open source, Java-built platform have addressed the arbitrary file read flaw along with several other bugs discovered by Swiss security firm SonarSource.Miscreants who abuse the vulnerability could take over GoCD servers and execute arbitrary code, as well as impersonate GoCD agents and seize control of software delivery pipelines.The vulnerability was sufficiently serious to prompt the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue a warning urging users to update their systems or apply workarounds. SolarWinds-style threat“Attackers could leak API keys to external services such as Docker Hub and GitHub, steal private source code, get access to production environments, and overwrite files that are being produced as part of the build processes,” said SonarSource security researcher Simon Scannell in a blog post.The flaw, he added, could serve as a springboard for attacks of a similar nature to the SolarWinds hack, “where attackers gained access to the software delivery pipeline and added a backdoor to critical software, leading to one of the most impactful supply-chain attacks thus far”.Catch up with the latest software supply chain attack news and analysisThe lack of public data on how widely GoCD is used makes it hard to gauge the impact of a hypothetical supply chain attack, Scannell tells The Daily Swig, “but we know that it is used by Fortune 500 companies”.He adds: “An attacker who has compromised a CI/CD pipeline can push malicious code into anything the pipeline produces – for example Docker images, JAR files, executables, libraries, etc.“The malicious code would then impact anyone who uses and trusts the produced software.”	Broken authenticationThe researchers unearthed the vulnerability after discovering a breaking change made in August 2018 that removed support for OAuth and made endpoints exposed by add-ons responsible for enforcing authentication. “Prior to this commit, these endpoints were accessible to authenticated users only,” said Scannell.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE NPM package UA-Parser-JS poisoned with cryptomining, password-stealing malwareThe issue was ushered into existence by the introduction in 2020 of Business Continuity, an add-on designed to mitigate the impact of a GoCD server failure or that of its database node.This add-on has been removed from the latest version, but Scannell says he is unsure how the wider breaking change “will be addressed in the long-term”.Timeline and patchesAll GoCD instances running versions between v20.6.0 and v21.2.0 are affected by the flaw.GoCD’s security team were alerted to the vulnerabilities on October 18 through the tool’s vulnerability disclosure program on HackerOne. The issues were subsequently addressed in version v21.3.0, which landed on Tuesday (October 26).“If no update can be run immediately, we recommend setting up firewall rules to prevent any HTTP requests to the /add-on/** and/or /add-on/business-continuity/** endpoints,” said Scannell.The researcher also warned that SonarSource had found “hundreds of instances exposed to the internet” in violation of best practices.“We would like to thank the GoCD security team who have been exceptionally responsive in the disclosure process,” added Scannell.SonarSource says a forthcoming, follow-up blog post will detail a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability and remote code execution (RCE) bug chain in GoCD.This article was updated on November 1 with a reference to a threat alert issued by CISA.DON’T FORGET TO READ Discourse fixes critical validation-related vulnerability in forum software",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/critical-flaw-in-gocd-provides-platform-for-supply-chain-attacks,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'DevOps', 'Research', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Authentication', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Network', 'Security', 'RCE', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Passwords', 'XSS', 'java', 'API', 'DevSecOps', 'VDP', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Enterprise', 'Switzerland', 'Europe']"
no,"Video conferencing platforms must improve privacy for users, data protection authorities warn",New cross-country report highlights need for better policies,"Six national data protection and privacy authorities have released their findings after an investigation into video teleconferencing (VTC) companies’ practices.The bodies, from Australia, Canada, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, China, Switzerland, and the UK, are broadly happy with the level of engagement from the companies concerned, but are calling for improvements to their privacy measures.With the use of teleconferencing rocketing as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold, the authorities last summer asked Microsoft, Google, Cisco, Zoom, and Houseparty to explain their privacy and security measures. All but Houseparty responded.Houseparty did engage with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office as part of a separate enquiry, and in any case closed down its video teleconferencing service two months ago.Findings“The dialogue between VTC companies and data protection authorities has proven effective, efficient, and mutually beneficial,” say the authorities in their report.“Moving forward, the joint signatories highlight this model of engagement as valuable and replicable in circumstances where emerging issues would benefit from open dialogue to help set out regulatory expectations, clarify understanding, identify good practice, and foster public trust in innovative technologies.”The report (PDF) sets out a number of recommendations. They call on VTC companies to make end-to-end encryption available to all users, and to be the default for one-to-one calls of a sensitive nature, such as tele-health communications.Read more of the latest privacy newsThey also want vendors to provide clarity over the secondary use of personal information.“Where personal information is used for secondary purposes, VTC companies should explicitly make this clear to users with proactive, upfront, and easily understandable messaging about what information is used and for which purposes,” they write.“Where secondary purposes include targeted advertising and/or the use of tracking cookies, it is recommended that VTC companies only do this if users have expressly opted-in to such processing.”Finally, the authorities are calling for VTC companies to be completely transparent about where data is stored and how it is routed, and where possible giving users a choice.They should also implement measures, contractual or otherwise, to ensure that information is adequately protected when shared with third parties, including in foreign jurisdictions.Class actionThe report comes as Zoom settles a class action privacy lawsuit in the US for $86 million after claims that it shared personal data with Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn, as well as allowing unauthorized ‘Zoombombing’ to occur.However, in a recent report, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that the cybersecurity and privacy risks of VTC services are no greater than those found on the internet in general.“Instead, the leading services have all begun to converge in the security and convenience of their apps,” it concluded.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Slack contains an XSLeak vulnerability that de-anonymizes users",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/video-conferencing-platforms-must-improve-privacy-for-users-data-protection-authorities-warn,"['Privacy', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Microsoft', 'Google', 'Telecommunications', 'Research', 'UK', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'North', 'America', 'Oceania', 'China', 'Asia', 'Europe']"

no,Attack the block – How a security researcher cracked 70% of urban WiFi networks in one hit,A new attack takes advantage of weak WiFi passwords,"A new attack technique has been demonstrated that is capable of widespread WiFi cracking.CyberArk security researcher Ido Hoorvitch said that properties in urban areas often have unsafe and weak WiFi passwords in use that could be “easily cracked or even guessed by curious neighbors or malicious actors”.Hoorvitch, who lives in Tel Aviv, Israel, decided to put his theories to the test.In total, 5,000 WiFi hashes around his neighborhood were gathered as a sample group by wandering the streets with network sniffing equipment.Read more of the latest hacking newsThe researcher then set to work developing an attack capable of striking each of these networks rapidly and efficiently.The gear used included a ‘monster’ cracking rig, made up of eight xQUADRO RTX 8000 (48GB) GPUs in CyberArk Labs, although Hoorvitch noted that this type of attack does not need such heavy-duty equipment to pull off. Instead, all you need is a laptop and basic sniffing equipment.A vulnerability, discovered by Hashcat’s lead developer, Jens ‘atom’ Steube, is at the heart of the attack. This bug can be exploited to retrieve PMKID hashes and crack network passwords.Wholesale password crackingPMKID hashes, obtained through wireless sniffers with monitor mode enabled, can then be cracked through the generation and cracking of PMKs with SSIDs and different passphrases.When a PMKID is generated that is equal to the PMKID retrieved from an access point, this data has been generated from the correct WiFi password.After using the Hcxdumptool utility to sniff out PMKID hashes, Hoorvitch then used a conversion tool and Hashcat, a password recovery utility.INDUSTRY NEWS Infosec skills gap widens in all regions bar Asia-Pacific – reportAccording to Hoorvitch, many residents of Tel Aviv use cellphone numbers as their WiFi password, and so it was not long before numerous hashes were cracked, their passwords obtained, and doors opened into their networks.In these cases, it took approximately nine minutes for each crack on the researcher’s laptop.In total, the team was able to crack over 3,500 WiFi networks around Tel Aviv, approximately 70% of the 5,000 network sample.Protecting home networksIf routers do not support roaming modes, then they are not susceptible to this form of attack. However, Hoorvitch noted that many routers, “manufactured by many of the world’s largest vendors, are vulnerable”.In order to protect yourselves and your internet connection, complex passwords should be in play – preferably with both lower and upper case, at least one symbol and digit, as well as a length of at least 10 characters – and default username/password combinations absolutely should be changed.The researcher also noted that keeping router firmware up to date will protect your hardware from attacks based on vulnerability exploits. Weak encryption protocols, including WAP/WAP1, should also be disabled.“With the continued shift to remote work due to the pandemic, securing home networks has become imperative and poses a risk to the enterprise if not done so,” Hoorvitch commented.“Home networks rarely have the same controls as enterprise networks. And a security program is only as strong as its weakest link.”Hoorvitch detailed his findings in a technical blog post on October 26.READ MORE SQL injection flaw in billing software app tied to US ransomware infection",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/attack-the-block-how-a-security-researcher-cracked-70-of-urban-wifi-networks-in-one-hit,"['Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Passwords', 'Israel', 'Authentication', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Middle', 'East', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Research', 'Hardware', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Encryption', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Privacy']"
no,Infosec skills gap widens in all regions bar Asia-Pacific – report,Overall worldwide shortfall shrinks 400k to 2.7m unfilled positions,"UPDATED The global information security workforce gap has shrunk for the second consecutive year – but only by dint of pandemic-related progress in the Asia-Pacific region, a new report reveals.The gulf between the supply of, and demand for, cybersecurity talent actually widened in every other region assessed by (ISC)² – namely Europe, North America, and Latin America.Published today (October 26), the US-based infosec certification organization’s latest Cybersecurity Workforce Study cited a comparatively slow economic recovery in the Asia-Pacific, which meant demand for security talent was lower, as the main driver for the region bucking this trend.Supply-side progress(ISC)² now estimates the global infosec skills gap to stand at around 2.7 million unfilled positions worldwide.This represents a fall of around 400,000 from 3.1 million in 2020, when compared to 2019 the gap shrank for the first time in memory, by nearly one million.Significant progress is being made on the supply side, with 700,000 new entrants to the field observed since 2020, increasing the global infosec workforce to 4.2 million.RELATED Cyber awareness initiative aims to close infosec workforce gap with free school curriculumHowever, an accompanying surge in demand, in an increasingly digitally connected world beset by ever-more numerous and sophisticated cyber-attacks, offset much of the advance.The cybersecurity workforce needs to grow 65% from present levels in order to adequately meet global needs, (ISC)² estimates.For 60% of infosec pros surveyed by the nonprofit, cybersecurity staffing shortages were putting their organization at serious risk.Unsurprisingly, growing demand for scarce infosec skills had an inflationary impact on pay packets, with the average global cybersecurity salary rising from $83,000 to $90,900 year on year.Diversity initiativesAsked which people-oriented initiatives organizations were prioritizing in order to attract fresh infosec talent, respondents most frequently cited additional training (36%), more flexible working conditions (33%), and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives (29%).Cited by 40% of respondents (and mirroring the study’s 2020 edition), cloud security was again considered the top current priority for cybersecurity professionals’ skills development.Most information security professionals (85%) continue to work remotely to some degree because of the ongoing pandemic, the latest study also revealed.Misconception“The underlying issue isn’t just that demand is growing, it is that the jobs market consistently can’t attract enough people into cybersecurity careers to service demand,” Clar Rosso, CEO of (ISC)², tells The Daily Swig.“It’s partly an education issue that the whole industry needs to rise to. We recently announced plans for an entry-level certification to build a more accessible career path for younger professionals and first-time cybersecurity workers, at the same time addressing the misconception that cybersecurity is a career only for those with highly technical training and experience.”READ MORE (ISC)² hopes diversity drive will hasten glacial progress on plugging infosec workforce gapRosso adds: “Recognizing and addressing diversity, equity and inclusion will help employers to grow the talent pool immensely. Moreover, it will help to attract more and a far broader selection of people from a variety of backgrounds and social groups, making cybersecurity a profession that is more representative and one more people want to enter and remain in.”Asked about the role of government in tackling the skills deficit, she commented: “Concerted, focused efforts to strengthen the cybersecurity workforce at all levels of government is necessary. The strong growth in the workforce estimate in Singapore, for example, may be attributed to that nation not only shoring up technology and capabilities, but also the workforce.“Governments are also in an advantageous position of being able to recruit more broadly and build their ranks with entry and early-career practitioners – investing in their training and development, solidifying national cyber defences, and ultimately creating a larger, skilled and qualified workforce.”The study’s findings were based on a survey of 4,753 cybersecurity and ICT professionals working for organizations of various sizes in 14 countries.This article was updated on October 26 with additional comments from Clar Rosso of (ISC)²RECOMMENDED ‘Find out what sparks joy’ – YouTube educator and security expert Katie Paxton-Fear on carving out a successful infosec career",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/infosec-skills-gap-widens-in-all-regions-bar-asia-pacific-report,"['Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Education', 'Enterprise', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Research', 'Certification', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'Latin', 'America', 'North', 'America', 'Oceania', 'US', 'Canada', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'UK', 'France', 'Germany', 'Ireland', 'Spain', 'Netherlands', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'Singapore', 'South', 'Korea']"

no,"Africa sees increase in ransomware, botnet attacks – but online scams still pose biggest threat","Fraud is still the primary goal of cybercriminals operating across the continent, Interpol warns in latest market report","Online scams are still the biggest cyber threat to African citizens, a new report has revealed, though ransomware attacks are “expanding rapidly” across the continent.The study (PDF), published by Interpol yesterday (October 25), found that internet-enabled fraud was the biggest risk to African countries, which have reported a sharp increase in the number of online banking scams, including instances of banking and credit card fraud, in 2021.Read more of the latest ransomware newsDigital extortion – defined as “allegations of sexually compromising images or direct blackmail campaigns” – was the second highest recorded cyber threat.While business email compromise (BEC) scams have also risen in prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic, due, in part, to the increase of businesses and organizations relying on bank wire transfers.Better connectedThe number of African citizens who have access to the internet is estimated to be around 500 million, which is a huge figure in itself, though when compared to the overall population only equates to 38%.Leading the way is Kenya with 83% of its population being online, Nigeria with 60%, and South Africa with 56%.RELATED Millions of South Africans caught up in security incident after debt recovery firm suffers ‘significant data breach’Fraud has historically been an issue across the continent – in particular, phishing campaigns and romance scams – however the report found that the increase in digitization across Africa has created new avenues for crime.The report reads: “… the move towards a digital society – particularly within the African region – has created new attack vectors for criminals to both obfuscate their identity and target new victims.”Ransomware risingWhile social engineering remains the most popular attack vector in Africa, the study found that instances of ransomware and botnet attacks are also rising.Ransomware is the fourth most prevalent cyber-attack identified in the report, which states that more than 61% of companies in the region were affected by ransomware in 2020 alone.“These attacks targeted some African countries’ critical infrastructure, including healthcare and maritime sectors,” it reads.CATCH UP Mauritian government’s plan to intercept encrypted web traffic marks ‘death knell for freedom of speech’In fifth place was botnets, networks of compromised machines used as a tool to automate largescale campaigns such as DDoS attacks, phishing, and malware distribution.The report reads: “The number of botnet victim detections in Africa [in 2021] was around 50,000, with a monthly average detection of 3,900.”The damage doneThis shift in tactics is blamed, in part, by Interpol on the lack of cybersecurity practices for businesses in the region, particularly worrying due to the widespread adoption of online banking.Interpol claims in the report that 90% of African businesses are operating “without the necessary cybersecurity protocols in place”.In 2016, says Interpol, cybercrime cost the South African economy $573 million, while the Nigerian economy lost $500 million and Kenyan economy an estimated $36 million.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Bug bounty leader Clément Domingo on cybersecurity in Africa, hacking events, and chaining vulnerabilities for maximum impact",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/africa-sees-increase-in-ransomware-botnet-attacks-but-online-scams-still-pose-biggest-threat,"['Africa', 'Cybercrime', 'Research', 'Ransomware', 'Fraud', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Phishing', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Coronavirus', 'Organizations', 'Government', 'Malware', 'Healthcare', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Privacy', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Maritime', 'Finance', 'DDoS', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service']"
No,"Popular NPM package UA-Parser-JS poisoned with cryptomining, password-stealing malware",Developer moves quickly to address vulnerabilities after his account was compromised,"An NPM package with millions of weekly downloads has been speedily updated after being hijacked and armed with cryptomining and password-exfiltrating malware.Three malicious versions of the UA-Parser-JS library, which detects a user’s browser, engine, OS, CPU, and device via their browser’s user agent, surfaced on Friday (October 22).The deliberately introduced critical vulnerabilities were absent from newer, benign versions released by the JavaScript package’s developer a few hours later.It is thought that the miscreants were able to embed the malware within the package after gaining access to a maintainer’s account.Update ASAPDevelopers who inadvertently downloaded malicious versions, which can execute malicious code on both Linux and Windows devices, have been urged to update their systems “as soon as possible and check their systems for suspicious activity”, reads a security advisory on GitHub.The rogue versions are 0.7.29, 0.8.0, and 1.0.0. The issue was remediated in versions 0.7.30, 0.8.1, and 1.0.1.Read more of the latest software supply chain attack news and analysisMachines with the vulnerable versions “installed or running should be considered fully compromise”, warns the advisory.“All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer,” it continues.“The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.”‘Flooded by spam’Sabotaging UA-Parser-JS was a real coup for the attacker given its reach. The package is downloaded around eight million times a week and is used by Google, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft, among numerous other tech giants.UA-Parser-JS developer Faisal Salman believes the package was hijacked after attackers compromised his NPM account.“I noticed something unusual when my email was suddenly flooded by spam from hundreds of websites (maybe so I [didn’t] realize something was up, luckily the effect is quite the contrary),” he recounted in a bug remediation thread.In the same thread, GitHub user @aimozg said the trojan reads browser user data files, adding that they checked ‘files written’ against their infected PC and “it does look like a script to export OS credentials and a copy of cookies DB file from Chrome”.Based on the package’s weekly download rate and the four hours the malicious releases were available, the developer told The Daily Swig that a guesstimate for the number of malicious downloads might be in the region of 188,000.Impersonator-turned-hijackerThe corrupted package appears to be linked to another trio of rogue NPM libraries discovered earlier in the month by researchers from DevOps automation specialist Sonatype.One of these JavaScript packages, which impersonated legitimate libraries but in fact launched cryptominers on Windows, macOS, and Linux machines, purported to be UA-Parser-JS.Sonatype said it alerted the NPM security team to the malicious packages on October 15 within hours of their release, and the rogue libraries were removed on the same day. The NPM account for the author who released them was also deactivated.Sonatype said the rogue libraries were among thousands of suspicious packages – “either confirmed malicious, previously known to be malicious, or dependency confusion copycats” – that it had detected on the NPM Registry in recent weeks.The firm’s latest annual State of the Software Supply Chain Report recently revealed that software supply chain attacks have soared by 650% year on year, surpassing 12,000 incidents over 12 months.The Daily Swig has sent additional queries to package developer Faisal Salman.

no,Polygon pays out record $2 million bug bounty reward for critical vulnerability,Ethical hacker bags top prize for double spend flaw in smart contract,"UPDATED Polygon, a blockchain technology company, has paid out $2 million in bug bounty rewards for a ‘double spend’ vulnerability that could have wreaked havoc across its network.The flaw, discovered by ethical hacker Gerhard Wagner, enabled an attacker to double the amount of cryptocurrency they intend to withdraw up to 233 times.This could have allowed a malicious actor who has deposited just $4,500 to withdraw $1 million – and an attacker with $3.8 million could exploit the flaw to acquire up to $850 million.Weak bridgePolygon is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.The framework offers a “trustless, two-way transaction channel” between Polygon and Ethereum.This ‘blockchain bridge’ uses a network called Plasma to authenticate and process withdrawals. It was in a contract on Plasma, the DepositManagerProxy, that the flaw was discovered.Read more of the latest cryptocurrency security newsThe vulnerability, which is explained in technical detail in a blog post from Wagner, takes advantage of the fact that when a user deposits funds into the blockchain, they are “locked in” at the first stage (L1) and made available on the Plasma network.An aggregator called the ‘child’ chain bundles the Plasma transactions into blocks and submits checkpoints to L1, which confirms that transactions have been successfully processed on the child chain and can also detect misbehavior.When a user decides to withdraw their funds back to L1, the tokens need to be ‘burned’ on the Plasma chain.The user presents the receipt of the burn transaction to the Plasma bridge as proof that the tokens were burned and, after a challenge period of seven days, the funds can be withdrawn back to the user on L1.A flaw in the network could have allowed an attacker to burn a single transaction up to 233 times – potentially releasing $850 million in funds.Third-party perilWagner said he believes the vulnerability was present because the Plasma network was built based on third-party code.“If I had to guess why the bug happened, I would say it might be due to using someone else’s code and not having a 100% understanding of what it does,” he wrote.Wagner added: “It’s OK to use exiting building blocks when you write smart contracts, but you must understand all implications of doing so. At the end of the day, it’s your code; it does not matter if you or someone else wrote it.”The researcher said that the issue was fixed by “rejecting any encoding that does not start with 0x00”.He said: “It’s not very elegant, but it fixes the double-spending bug by hard coding the encoding meta character.”Bug huntingSpeaking to The Daily Swig, Wagner said that his experience working with fraud-proof systems made him “pretty confident his find was worth the maximum $2 million payout.He said: “When I verified the exploit and did the impact analysis, I was pretty confident that the bug was worth the maximum bounty. The Polygon team quickly came to the same conclusion after their investigation and confirmed the bounty reward.“I have experience with fraud-proof systems, specifically Plasma, so I understand how it works and what can go wrong. I have spent approximately four days looking at the code. In the end, I almost gave up as I thought the implementation was ok until I realized what happened to the proof path. “I had the PoC exploit in minutes as it was easy to create once you knew what to do.”Wagner added: “My recommendation for anyone in infosec thinking about going into crypto is, don’t be afraid to invest time into learning. It takes time to understand this new frontier. It will pay off eventually. “The opportunities in crypto as a hacker are tremendous.

no,Node.js sandboxes are open to prototype pollution,"Sandbox breakout can lead to remote code execution, researchers warn","A bug in vm2, a sandbox for testing untrusted JavaScript code, makes it possible for malicious parties to circumvent the library’s security controls and carry out remote code execution (RCE) attacks, a group of researchers have found.vm2’s GitHub page describes the library as “a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules. Securely!”However, CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, a cybersecurity research group in Germany, found that the library is open to prototype pollution attacks.Prototype pollution is a kind of vulnerability in JavaScript and other object-based languages that allows attackers to run arbitrary code by dynamically injecting properties into sensitive objects.Sandbox breakoutA proof-of-concept (PoC) on Snyk shows how a few lines of code can exploit the vulnerability in vm2 to carry out a prototype pollution and RCE attack on the host.While the bug has been filed as ‘prototype pollution’, Cristian-Alexandru Staicu, one of the researchers who helped discover and report the bug, told The Daily Swig that a better title would be “sandbox breakout”.RELATED Prototype pollution vulnerabilities rife among high-traffic websites, study finds“In the PoC published by Snyk, we show both a prototype pollution payload and an arbitrary code execution. They are both the result of sandbox breakout,” Staicu said. “vm2 is supposed to prevent access to the global object/privileged operations (e.g., require), and we show how an attacker might get around this security control.”While the vulnerability does not provide root access to the host device, it gives complete access to the Node.js API, something vm2 is trying to restrict, Staicu explained.Recurring bugThe team found the bug during a months-long project investigating vulnerabilities in JavaScript sandboxes.In March, they reported a sandbox breakout bug in isolated-vm, another sandbox, which allowed attackers to obtain a reference to the ‘function’ object of the Node.js context.They’ve found similar bugs in at least three other sandbox libraries, Staicu said, though he couldn’t share details since the disclosure process with the relevant developers remains ongoing and patches are yet to be released.“Our results so far show that sandboxing JavaScript code with ES6 proxies is hard,” he said. “We found breakouts in most of the systems we analyzed, so one must be very careful when executing malicious code using these libraries.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Historic scientific notation bug foils WAF defenses",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/node-js-sandboxes-are-open-to-prototype-pollution,"['Node.js', 'JavaScript', 'RCE', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Industry', 'News']"

No,"Japanese punctuation exacerbates privacy flaw that leaks one-word search terms in Google, Firefox browsers",Researcher questions efficacy of proposed remedies as debate rumbles on 18 months after disclosure,"A peculiarity of Japanese punctuation appears to have heightened the impact of a Chrome and Firefox vulnerability whose resolution has been complicated by the potential impact on enterprise users.The privacy flaw leaks Chrome and Firefox users’ search terms to their internet service providers (ISPs) without their consent under certain conditions and, as Mozilla has acknowledged, could potentially expose them to surveillance by malicious actors.BACKGROUND Firefox and Chrome yet to fix privacy issue that leaks user searches to ISPsMozilla and Google were alerted to the problem back in April 2020 by security researcher Duy Khuong, and Firefox 78 launched two months later with support for disabling behavior that caused the vulnerability.Eighteen months after disclosure, Google is now planning to fix the issue by turning a vulnerable feature off by default.One-word searchesModern browsers ordinarily don’t leak users’ online activity to ISPs, albeit ISPs can see which web pages they visit.However, if users enter a single word, or multiple words separated by hyphens, into the address bar of Chrome or (in its default settings) Firefox, the search terms are relayed to the ISP’s servers within DNS queries.The flaw would not be triggered by multi-word search terms without spaces (so ‘infosec news’ would not leak; ‘infosec-news’ would).Even DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and privacy-protecting search engine DuckDuckGo fail to protect users from the bug, Khuong discovered.Linguistic curveballJapanese search terms, it transpires, leak far more readily since words in Japanese sentences are seldom separated by spaces.This revelation appears to have provided some impetus for a belated resolution from Google after Covid-19 initially delayed remediation and, after a July 2020 update indicated a fix was being attempted, the relevant Chromium bug tracker fell quiet for a year. ANALYSIS The future of browser security: Check out the latest features destined for mobile and desktop“This problem is more critical than that original post says,” a Chromium developer observed in July 2021, before explaining that “Japanese, ‘one word’ search text is used more than [with the] English language”.They also said that the way “Chromium broadcasts the ‘one word’ search text to LAN in windows means all IoT device[s] in my house can listen [to] the ‘one word’ search text”.Khuong told The Daily Swig he was hitherto unaware of this impact and that other, as yet-undiscovered impacts may exist. “This also applies to Firefox, because the underlying mechanism is the same,” he added.Decades-old featureAs reported by The Daily Swig last year, the flaw appears to be the legacy of a decades-old feature whereby the browsers consult local DNS in order to distinguish between single-word searches and intentions to visit local, single-word websites used by private and enterprise networks.“Due to the ongoing use of this legacy feature of the DNS system, we do not have immediate plans to change the default behavior,” Mozilla tells The Daily Swig.However, in a related Bugzilla ticket, ‘Tusing’ said earlier this month: “That isn’t [a] reasonable default from a privacy perspective” because “a vanishingly small number of web users access an intranet like that”.‘Balancing act’‘Gregory Pappas’ then countered that Tusing had underestimated the extent of intranet use and was proposing a solution that would “alienate enterprise users even more by forcing them to do even more cajoling to make it suitable for their use”.However, Khuong has echoed Tusing’s sentiments, saying Mozilla have underestimated the bug’s severity and are “putting enterprise support above the user’s privacy protection, and discouraging contributions from others”.Pappas added: “Privacy on the web is a balancing act and Firefox remains the only major browser that offers settings to plug the hole.”RELATED Firefox Suggest lands in the US, bringing ads to the browser search barHowever, a member of the Chromium team indicated on September 14 that the issue would also be remediated in Chrome “in a few weeks”, along with a slew of other security issues, by disabling the omnibox’s Intranet Redirect Detector feature.However, Khuong is unconvinced by the proposal, since enterprises would have the hassle of re-enabling a feature they still need and doing so would mean one-word searches will still “be sent around for DNS lookups”.The researcher proposed an alternative fix on the bug thread on October 19 and is awaiting a reply.Google did not respond to our requests for comment and Mozilla has declined to comment further.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/japanese-punctuation-exacerbates-privacy-flaw-that-leaks-one-word-search-terms-in-google-firefox-browsers,"['Browsers', 'Privacy', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Chrome', 'firefox', 'Google', 'Mozilla', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'DNS', 'Zero-day', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Enterprise', 'North', 'America', 'US', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations']"
no,EU ban on anonymous domain registration welcomed by threat intel firm,"‘This raises the bar and makes it expensive for easy cyber criminality,’ argues DomainTools","Forthcoming European Union regulations that would curtail anonymous domain registration has been welcomed by a security firm despite concerns from some including Germany’s top-level domain registry, DENIC.Wide-ranging proposals to achieve a “high common level of cybersecurity across the Union” and update the 2016 network and information systems (NIS Directive), would restrict the anonymous registration of domains, among other measures.Catch up with the latest internet infrastructure news and analysisAnonymous domain registration is often associated with illegal activities including the distribution of malware and the hosting of phishing sites as well as the authorized distribution of copyright protected works.Whois dataPeople or organizations registering domains are already routinely obliged to supply their name, email address, and physical address. As things stand, this information is seldom checked so that registration under false or assumed names is commonplace.The rule change would introduce provisions that would oblige domain registrars to collect more information from registrants and (crucially) verify that information.This is necessary, in part, to ensure the stability of the Domain Name System (DNS), as the draft regulations (PDF) explain.For the purpose of contributing to the security, stability, and resilience of the DNS, ?Member States shall ensure that TLD registries and the entities providing domain ?name registration services for the TLD shall collect and maintain accurate and ?complete domain name registration data in a dedicated database facility with due ?diligence subject to Union data protection law as regards data which are personal ?data.While broadly welcoming Article 23, which covers databases of domain names and registration data, Germany’s TLD registry DENIC expresses significant reservations about the proposals in its feedback to the EU Commission. It worries that collecting registration data wouldn’t necessarily help in preventing abuse.“While accurate and complete registration data is already collected in the context and for the purpose mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is not obvious to us, how failure to do so would affect the security, stability, or resilience of the DNS as such,” DENIC said.The German registry added: “Identification of the registrant does not provide information about the entity exercising actual technical control over the delegated namespace and even less so about entities providing content or services within that namespace.”DON’T MISS Hong Kong’s anti-doxxing law comes into force despite human rights criticismHowever, Chad Anderson, senior security researcher for DomainTools, a domain-name and DNS-based cyber threat intelligence firm, said access to registration information would offer a vital tool for network security defenders.“We’ve certainly found other ways of fingerprinting actors based on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), but taking down large swaths of domains tied to a single individual is much quicker when they can actually be tied to that individual and time is increasingly of the essence,” according to Anderson.Anderson compares the registration of domains (a form of digital property) to the operation of a property registration systems for houses.Doxxing fearsThe plans could mean the end of ‘whois privacy’ services for proxy registration of domains, threatening the safety of activists and whistleblowers, according to German MEP Patrick Breyer of the Pirate Party.“This indiscriminate identification policy for domain holders is a big step towards abolishing anonymous publications and leaks on the internet,” Breyer warned in a blog post.“This policy endangers website operators, because only anonymity effectively protects against data theft and loss, stalking and identity theft, doxxing and ‘death lists’.”Concerns that the registration of domain would impacts whistleblowers and activists are misplaced, according to DomainTools’ Anderson.“They should all be using Tor and pre-built sites anyways to protect their anonymity,” according to Anderson, who added, “if anything this will force their hand to use better operational security”.More difficult, more expensiveEven though once the regulations come into effect cybercriminals can still hide behind corporations or registrars in other countries, the result will still be to make malicious activity more difficult and expensive, DomainTools argues.Anderson concludes: “This raises the bar and makes it expensive for easy cyber criminality like business email compromise (BEC) and credential phishing campaigns. Additionally, this reduces the attacking area left to monitor as it reduces the number of registrars that attackers can use.”The draft directive was amended (PDF) in March and may be further changed before ratification. The amendments clearly specify that telephone contact information needs to amongst the information collected.Member States shall ensure that the database infrastructure of domain name registration data… contains relevant information, which shall include at least the registrants’ name, their physical and email address, as well as their telephone number, to identify and contact the holders of the domain names and the points of contact administering the domain names under the TLDs.The amended measures also clarify that the registrars will be obliged to provide “domain name registration data, including personal data, upon duly justified requests of legitimate access seekers, in compliance with Union data protection law” within 72 hours of receiving a request.A complete catalogue of feedback to the proposals can be found here.The lead committee ITRE is expected to take a position on the proposals by the end of October. Even after that stage the bill still needs to be negotiated with the EU Council, and may be subject to further amendments before it comes into effect.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE NSA warns of heightened wildcard TLS certificate risk",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/eu-ban-on-anonymous-domain-registration-welcomed-by-threat-intel-firm,"['Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Europe', 'DNS', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Privacy', 'OpSec', 'Tor', 'Phishing', 'Malware', 'Cybercrime', 'Industry', 'News', 'Government', 'Germany']"

Worse still, from a security point of view, 62% said patching often has to give way to other priorities.Yet despite the hassle caused by patching, some vendors are now starting to alert sysadmins to pending security releases, via pre-advisories.The idea is to give security and IT administrators forewarning that a system or application will need to be patched or updated.But the move has both proponents and detractors, with some industry players concerned that pre-advisories will help malicious hackers more than they help security teams.Security pre-advisories: Advanced warning for sysadminsA standard security advisory is simply a notice to users of a system or software of a vulnerability. It describes the issue, lists any CVE IDs, and details the affected systems or projects.For years, this standard format has served the industry well, allowing security teams to identify relevant vulnerabilities, prioritize fixes and, once available, applying patches.But a growing number of vendors and open source project maintainers are moving towards pre-advisories, with the goal of giving IT teams, and other professionals, including pen testers, more notice of security vulnerabilities and when a patch might be available.RECOMMENDED Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowIn some respects, Microsoft pioneered pre-advisories, with its regular Patch Tuesday releases – a pattern other large vendors have followed.When used correctly, however, pre-advisories could move users away from the idea of patching on a specific day and potentially boosting security by reducing the time it takes for an organization to implement important patches.“Pre-advisories could help get us away from this notion of ‘timetabled’ patching that sees sysadmins make time in the diary on a specific day to patch,” Stuart Walker, senior consultant at Prism Infosec, a cybersecurity consultancy, told The Daily Swig.“Yes, that allocates time but it also downplays the importance of patching, which is why it gets sidelined and forgotten.”Walker added: “I’d like to think this approach [pre-advisories] will escalate patching up the security agenda so it becomes a much more immediate concern, so that patches are applied when and as needed.”Save it for another dayPushing patching up the agenda is certainly worthwhile as data breaches are all too often traced back to unpatched, and often older, systems. And it could put pressure on vendors to release CVEs, and patches, more quickly to reduce the number of zero-day, or near-zero-day (so-called ‘n-day’), vulnerabilities.“In an ideal world, all security patches would be automatically deployed with no system downtime or impact. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case,” Todd Gifford, chief technology officer at Optimising IT, told The Daily Swig.“So, their deployment needs to be managed like any other system change to minimise operational impact and balance security requirements.”Gifford added: “In terms of out and out effective security improvement [pre advisories] won’t actually increase absolute security in terms of adding additional controls. But mitigating information security risk is why patching is fundamental to securing systems and data.“Being able to plug security hole with a patch sooner rather is a good thing, as it minimises the amount of time a known vulnerability is available for an attacker to exploit.”Security advisories play an important role in the information security industryAccording to Daniel Spicer, chief security officer at Ivanti, part of the problem is the speed at which threat actors can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities. This can be within hours of their release.“Organizations need time and tools to prioritize vulnerabilities to remediate and reduce exposure to cyber-attacks – particularly when time is of the essence,” he says, noting that pre-advisories can help by alerting users to the fact that a patch is coming (and how much downtime might be needed to deploy it).At the same time, though, pre-advisories released by independent security researchers are putting pressure on vendors. And there are also those who believe that pre-advisories actually play into the hands of criminal hackers.“Researchers are putting increased pressure on vendors to close vulnerabilities they find on their platforms,” Brendan Kotze, CDO and co-founder of Performanta, told The Daily Swig.“Meanwhile, vendors have an almost unmanageable backlog of pre-advisories. This dilemma is causing increased friction between researchers and vendors, which seems to be playing into the hands of attackers, in some cases causing a media storm as researchers announce pre-advisories publicly, exposing unpatched vendors.”In the wrong handsThe risk of pre-advisories giving more ammunition to bad actors appears obvious: obtain a vulnerability before there is a patch, and it can be exploited. If vendors give advanced warning through pre-advisories, it could be argued that risk is higher still.Fortunately, most security researchers feel that the risk is small, or at least small enough to be outweighed by the benefits.“While it’s true that public pre-advisories could allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities, when a patch is released, an attacker can revert it to take advantage of any system that wasn’t suitably covered,” notes Kotze.Read more of the latest enterprise security news from around the worldBut although this is not impossible, the resources needed are significant, according to Prism Infosec’s Walker.“If advanced notice of security advisories and patches fell into the wrong hands it would only be of use to extremely well-resourced attackers such as those financed via a nation state,” he says.“They’d need access to dedicated exploit development teams that were able to turn something around within very tight timeframes and to have already identified their high value targets that were using that particular software.“I’d argue that if you have that level of skill and know the window is closing, you’d be unlikely to devote your time and energy to exploiting something that you know was going to be patched really soon.”As important, though, is the need to plan for software updates and maintenance, to head off security vulnerabilities as well as costs associated with aging systems.“The biggest issue is getting the budget, resource and the political will to upgrade systems to current operating systems, let alone patching them routinely,” Sebastian Hope, a cybersecurity expert at PA Consulting told The Daily Swig.“Greater advance notice of the need for patching is not the real issue. What is needed is a commitment from the organization to resourcing the upgrades.”READ MORE ‘Find out what sparks joy’ – YouTube educator and security expert Katie Paxton-Fear on carving out a successful infosec career",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-pre-advisories-a-simple-way-to-improve-the-patch-management-process,"['Deep', 'Dives', 'Analysis', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Research', 'Interviews', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Malware', 'RCE']"
no,Historic scientific notation bug foils WAF defenses,AWS WAF and ModSecurity get ‘blinded by science’,"Security researchers have discovered that a historic vulnerability affecting both MySQL and MariaDB databases caused serious flaws for security technologies from AWS.AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) customers were left unprotected against SQL injection attacks that relied on a scientific notation bug first discovered in 2013, research from GoSecure has revealed.The same, somewhat obscure flaw also affected customers of ModSecurity, an open-source WAF.Catch up on the latest vulnerability-related newsThe issue dates back to a Black Hat presentation from 2013, delivered by security researcher Roberto Salgado, that delved deep into various SQL injection techniques. The GoSecure team discovered that the aforementioned scientific notation bug, which was cited by Salgado, was far more powerful than first suspected.The flaw allowed SQL syntax to remain valid even when it should have been deemed invalid, confusing security defenses such as WAFs in the process. Problems ensued when handling scientific notations, specifically the e notation (exponential), as explained in a detailed technical blog post from GoSecure.The Montreal-based firm disclosed this WAF bypass bug to Amazon in August, receiving confirmation that it had been resolved at the start of October.It was only at this time that GoSecure discovered the Libinjection component of ModSecurity was similarly vulnerable. After confirming that stricter lockdown settings (specifically the paranoia level 2 workaround in ModSecurity/libinjection) alleviated the problem, GoSecure went public with its findings.Confusion bugAmazon Web Services (AWS) offers a product called CloudFront that can be combined with AWS WAF with predefined rules. Tests by GoSecure showed that these rules might be circumvented by taking advantage of the scientific notation vulnerability in the underlying technology.This flaw neither affects the data handling of MySQL or MariaDB, “nor did it let you escalate your privileges until we found the WAF bypass”, the researchers at GoSecure explain.“The security implications of this issue are outside the control of MySQL and MariaDB,” according to GoSecure. “Any WAF or similar security products that would disregard SQL requests formed like this would be vulnerable.”Problems arise for WAFs because what look like invalid requests become valid once the scientific notations are parsed by backend systems.“If requests are malformed, it is natural that security products wouldn’t consider them valid SQL, thus making them unnecessary to block,” GoSecure concludes.In response to a request to summarise their findings from The Daily Swig, GoSecure offered a concise explanation:“There’s a problem in MySQL and MariaDB’s SQL syntax parsers that silently drops some characters in a SQL query. By abusing this we could bypass WAFs including Amazon's AWS WAF (that’s fixed) and can bypass ModSecurity (fixable via config change).”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Node.js was vulnerable to a novel HTTP request smuggling technique",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/historic-scientific-notation-bug-foils-waf-defenses,"['WAF', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Amazon', 'Research', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"
No,Slack contains an XS-Leak vulnerability that de-anonymizes users,"Research inspired by similar flaws previously unearthed in Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft Live","A security hole in the file-sharing feature of Slack enables malicious actors to identify users outside of the workforce messaging platform.Slack apparently has no plans to patch the flaw in its web application, saying users can prevent such attacks by ensuring everyone in their workspace is ‘trusted’.Known as a cross-site leak (XS-Leak), the vulnerability allows attackers to circumvent same-origin policy, a browser security feature that prevents tabs and frames of different domains from accessing each other’s data.XSLeaks in social media platformsIn 2019, researchers from TU Darmstadt documented an XSLeak channel in image-sharing features of Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft Live, among other popular messaging and social media platforms.Basically, when users upload an image in their private chat threads, the host service creates a unique URL for that resource that is only accessible by parties within the thread. An attacker can abuse this mechanism to create a unique URL for a target user and then force the browsers of visitors to another website to request the same URL.RECOMMENDED What does the future hold for browser security? Check out the latest features destined for mobile and desktopDepending on the browser’s response, the attacker will determine if the visitor is the same user. This technique can be used for fingerprinting or spear phishing attacks.Security researcher Julien Cretel told The Daily Swig that the paper inspired him to check “whether Slack's file-sharing functionality was vulnerable to Leaky Image, and sure enough, it was... and still is”.From file-sharing to de-anonymizationThe XSLeak in Slack, which Cretel has documented comprehensively on his blog, is contingent on the attacker having a user account in the same Slack workspace as their targets and being able to send them direct messages.When a user uploads a file in a direct messaging channel, Slack generates a URL that is only accessible to parties to the conversation. Other users, regardless of being part of the Slack group or not, will be redirected to the main page when they try to retrieve the URL.Slack uses the ‘SameSite=lax’ directive to protect its session cookie, which means it is only available to requests from domains under specific conditions. However, Cretel shows that with some simple JavaScript coding, an attacker can create a webpage that circumvents the SameSite protection and fetches the URL. If the resource is accessible, the attacker confirms that the visitor is in fact the same Slack user.Cretel created a novel technique leveraging ‘form-action’, a directive available on Chromium-based browsers, in order to detect multiple Slack users. He also used Slack’s group DM messages to reduce the number of file uploads required to identify target users.Mitigation, not remediationThe bug has some limitations: it does not work on the desktop and mobile app or non-Chromium browsers such as Firefox and Safari.Cretel has filed an issue on the Chromium bug-reporting platform in the hope of getting the form-action directive quirk addressed.However, the researcher said Slack has declined to fix the bug on the grounds that, contrary to public services like Twitter, Slack is a trusted workspace and “there is at least some implied measure of trust, or at least familiarity, between two users in a Slack Workspace”.Read more of the latest news about security vulnerabilitiesHowever, he told The Daily Swig that “Slack’s response is somewhat conflicted. On the one hand, they assume that members of a given workspace are benevolent and trust each other; on the other hand, they urge workspace admins to diligently curate the list of members in order to prevent abuse.”In many Slack workspaces, the barrier of entry is very low. For example, Slack has a default setting that allows non-guest members to invite others to their workspace. And some Slack workspaces have effectively become very large, cross-business messaging forums.A spokesperson for Slack told The Daily Swig:“Slack is always working to ensure the safety and security of our platform, and we’re grateful to the security research community for their work in supporting that effort. “The best way to prevent attacks between members of a workspace is to ensure everyone in your workspace is a trusted member or partner. Slack gives each organization control over permissions to send invitations and tools to restrict membership as appropriate.“We know there are organizations that use Slack where membership may be more broad – for tighter control in these instances, we recommend setting permissions to only let Workspace Owners and Admins send invitations to new members.” Cretel said: “Although I'm underwhelmed by their response, I must admit I’m grateful that Slack allowed me to disclose the bug. Now that it’s in the open, perhaps pressure from their customers will make them reconsider their stance.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/slack-contains-an-xs-leak-vulnerability-that-de-anonymizes-users,"['XS-Leak', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'Privacy', 'Social', 'Media', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Mobile', 'JavaScript', 'Browsers', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering']"

no,L0phtCrack password auditing tool goes open source,Original developers invite OS community to develop further capabilities,"L0phtCrack – the venerable Windows system password auditing tool – has been released as an open-source utility.Christien Rioux (DilDog), one of the original authors of L0phtCrack while a member of hacker collective L0pht Heavy Industries more than 20 years ago, first said he planned to release an open source version of the tool in early August, around the time of the DEF CON conference.The release of L0phtCrack as an open source software utility this week follows the successful resolution of business-related obstacles.DON'T FORGET TO READ Latest web hacking tools – Q4 2021Terahash purchased the password auditing tool in April 2020 but the financing of the deal fell through and the technology fell back into the hands of Rioux and his colleagues as previous owners in June 2021.No updates or even bug fixes were released during Terahash’s 15-month stewardship of the project, The Daily Swig is informed.Viable, but nicheA decision was taken by Rioux and his former hacker colleagues at L0pht Heavy Industries not to find an alternative buyer but instead to develop the technology further as an open source project.The technology still had a future despite being difficult to support commercially as a standalone project.Rioux told The Daily Swig: “It was still a commercially viable product, but niche enough to not warrant further investment on the part of the development team. There's a big difference between ‘will people pay for it’ vs ‘are people willing to spend their time supporting it’”.Catch up on the latest open source software-related newsChris Wysopal (WeldPond), a former member of L0pht, added: “The original team found it took too much time to support part-time but not enough revenue was there to hire full-time employees or even contract employees.”Auditing Active Directory passwords was the most common use of L0phtCrack. It also can import and crack passwords from Linux, BSD, Solaris, and AIX (Unix-based systems).Wysopal has big ambitions for the technology, now that L0phtCrack 7.2.0 has been released to the open source community:That people to step in to assist with maintenance and project leadershipThat the plugin system and API are formalized and support for multiple cracking tools such as HashCat are addedThat support for new versions of Windows and other operating systems continuesAnd for integrations with more hash collection mechanisms such as ResponderMore than just password crackingWysopal told The Daily Swig: “I could hope that an organization such as OWASP or similar could assist with getting motivated people involved. I think this could be a framework for more than just password cracking eventually, rather the general automation of commonly performed ‘security audit’ tasks.”Rioux has been involved in writing code for L0phtCrack for more than 20 years, so the time has come for him to step back and let other developers take the lead while still being around to mentor the development of the project.L0phtCrack has a flexible plugin architecture that could potentially be extended over time to support better reporting and possible integrations with services such as Have I Been Pwned.It might be possible to ‘plug in’ nmap scanning and other vulnerability scanners with some effort, to schedule password and network audits on a recurring basis, and to generate reports in the background.The possibilities are myriad, but whether they will be realized or not depends on if the project can capture the interest of the open source community.Wysopal concluded: “The fact that Dil[Dog] has been developing and maintaining a commercial security tool for 20+ years is pretty unprecedented.

No,Node.js was vulnerable to a novel HTTP request smuggling technique,Bad line termination and incorrect parsing of chunk extensions exposed one of two HRS flaws,"The maintainers of Node.js have patched two HTTP request smuggling (HRS) vulnerabilities in the JavaScript runtime environment, including one found using what appears to be a new HRS technique.A server-side technology that allows JavaScript to be executed out of the browser, Node.js is an increasingly popular way of developing and hosting web apps.HTTP request smuggling interferes with how websites process sequences of HTTP requests received from users.Read more of the latest Node.js security news and analysisThe vulnerabilities were discovered by Mattias Grenfeldt and Asta Olofsson as part of research for a bachelor’s thesis in computer science at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. This has since been rewritten as a conference paper and accepted for IEEE EDOC 2021.“We set out to look for HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities in six open source web servers and six open source proxies. Node was one of them, but initially we didn't find any issues in it,” Grenfeldt tells The Daily Swig.“Some time later, while working on reporting the other issues found during the project, we just stumbled upon these two issues.”‘Classic HRS technique’The first, CVE-2021-22959, allows HTTP request smuggling due to spaces in headers, with the HTTP parser accepting requests with a space after the header name and before the colon.“This is a classic HRS technique,” says Grenfeldt. “Node interprets ‘Content-Length : 5’ as ‘Content-Length: 5’. If combined with a proxy which ignores such headers, but forwards them unmodified, then HRS is possible. There have been many issues in the past similar to this.“Interestingly, Regilero has also reported this exact issue to Node earlier, together with a bunch of other issues; they were collectively assigned CVE-2016-2086. All of the issues were fixed, except for the space + colon issue.”Novel techniqueMeanwhile, CVE-2021-22960 appears to represent a novel HRS technique, whereby combining bad line termination in one of the proxies investigated and incorrect parsing of chunk extensions in Node allows request smuggling.Grenfeldt and Olofsson found that the vulnerable proxy looked for a single newline (LF) character to terminate the line containing the chunk size, but didn’t, as is usual, check whether there was a carriage return before the LF.“Right before this line termination is the place for the seldom used chunk extensions feature. In chunk extensions you can specify extra parameters, like ‘a=b’, after the chunk size. However, parsing for this is rarely implemented in systems and many instead just allow any bytes in this region,” explains Grenfeldt.“These two problems combined enables us to construct a chunked body that the proxy interprets one way and Node interprets another way. We also found the same server behaviour in three other servers we investigated, making this the most severe problem we found.”Grenfeldt and Olofsson reported the issues on June 19 and 20, with Node releasing a fix on October 12.RELATED HAProxy vulnerability enables HTTP request smuggling attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/node-js-was-vulnerable-to-a-novel-http-request-smuggling-technique,"['Node.js', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Research', 'JavaScript', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Privacy', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Database', 'Security', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Bugs in malware create ‘backdoors’ for security researchers,Black hat trickery switched around to boost security defenses,"The multiple bugs and coding errors in malware offer defenders a means to create better defenses.This is according to a team presenting at the Virus Bulletin conference last week whose research suggests the tables can be turned on malicious actors to further web security.Malware authors often take advantage of vulnerabilities in software packages and flaws in security products to plant malware on vulnerable systems.New research from cloud security firm Zscaler, presented at the recent VB2021 conference, turns that approach on its head by exploiting bugs and coding errors in malware code to thwart infections by assorted botnet agents, ransomware, and trojans.Catch up on the latest malware related news and analysisTypically bugs in malware code cause the malicious software to crash and arise from multiple causes, Zscaler discovered.Sometimes malware doesn’t validate the output of a queried API or are unable to handle different types of C&C (command and control) response.Authors often develop malware according to their local environment and don’t consider other techniques, e.g ASLR (Address Space Layour randomisation), DEP (Data Execution Prevention), required to load modules in malware which cause them to crash.Zcaler’s research is based on a large-scale analysis of a data set of malicious samples that crashed in the Zscaler Cloud Sandbox between late 2019 and March 2021, so it builds on previous work by systematically looking for flaws in a large sample of real malware over an extended period.Dr Nirmal Singh Bhary, director of the malware labs at Zscaler, told The Daily Swig: “The malicious samples that we analyzed were from in-the-wild infections. Focus of our research was to find vulnerabilities that can be used to prevent infection on the client side or can be used as a kill switch.”READ MORE Introducing Malvuln.com – the first website ‘exclusively dedicated’ to revealing security vulnerabilities in malwareThe research team discovered that vulnerabilities in malware not only typically persist in malware families for a long time but offer a means for security researchers the find the Achilles Heel of malware strains.“An example of a case study that we mentioned in the research paper is Vidar malware,” Dr Bhary explained. “This malware steals different types of information from the infected system, but a specific registry key can be created to prevent the infection.”More examples of the research can be found on the conference website.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Israeli hospital cancels non-urgent procedures following ransomware attack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/bugs-in-malware-create-backdoors-for-security-researchers,"['Malware', 'Antivirus', 'Ransomware', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Events']"
No,"Google, Mozilla close to finalizing Sanitizer API for Chrome and Firefox browsers",Latest specification is a work in progress,"Leading browser vendors are putting the finishing touches to a set of APIs that make it easier for developers to protect their web applications against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.Many websites rely on dynamically generated content in the browser. Often, the generated markup includes content provided by outside sources, such as user-provided input, which can include malicious JavaScript code.Sanitizing dynamic markup and making sure it does not contain harmful code is one of the most serious challenges of web security.Native sanitization supportCurrently, web developers rely on third-party libraries such as DOMPurify to sanitize HTML content and prevent XSS attacks.The Sanitzer API, which was first proposed earlier this year in a draft specification, will give browsers native support to remove harmful code from markup that is dynamically added to web pages.The API is being jointly developed by Google, Mozilla, and Cure53, the maintainer of the DOMPurify library.Read more of the latest browser security news“The new Sanitizer API proposal is the first step towards a standardized API for a common task that many frontend libraries (e.g, React, Vue) or sanitizers (e.g, DOMPurify, sanitize-html) already perform when developers need to explicitly render unsafe HTML where they want to,” Lorenzo Stella, application security engineer at Doyensec, told The Daily Swig.Stella says that delegating sanitization to the browser makes it more accessible, secure, and hopefully faster.“The browser already has a good and safe parser, and knows best how it will treat each active element in the DOM. An external parser written in JS has overhead and is likely to be worse and outdated compared to the browser,” he said.Work in progressThe Sanitizer API is still in test mode and available in Firefox Nightly and Chrome 94+ through special flag settings.“We’re calling for developers with various different perspectives to test and experiment with the preview in order to ensure that the Sanitizer API clearly solves developers’ needs and expectations at initial rollout, which includes allowing the easy adoption of existing code,” Frederik Braun, security engineer at Mozilla, told The Daily Swig.The latest update to the draft, published last week, has ironed out some of the kinks in the original specification.The new version of the sanitizer takes the DOM context into account when sanitizing markup snippets, which patches some of the XSS security holes that previous sanitizers had. It also makes it easier to update old code to use the native sanitization features.“XSS is still one of the most dangerous security issues, and consistently ranked highest in the list of the Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses by MITRE,” Braun said.“The Sanitizer API is going to help developers mitigate the XSS problem by exposing a primitive that accepts potentially harmful HTML and returns guaranteed safe HTML.”READ What does the future hold for browser security? Check out the latest features destined for mobile and desktopIn comments to The Daily Swig, browser security researcher Jun Kokatsu called Sanitizer API “an important step towards securing the web”.The reliance on third-party sanitization opens the way for mutation XSS, a type of attack that takes advantage of the differences in how various browsers parse HTML data, Kokatsu said.“With Sanitizer API, browsers are now responsible for sanitization as well, and it’s more likely that changes to the HTML parser will be more carefully done,” Kokatsu said.“For example, adding a new HTML tag has to go to the Sanitizer API’s owner to discuss if it should be blocked by the sanitizer or not.”Complementing other security toolsDoyensec’s Stella warned that the Sanizer API should not be considered as a “catch-all mechanism for all web applications”.“There can be sanitization requirements that are not easily met by a general-purpose API like this. However, the library should play well with other enforcement mechanisms,” he said.Kokatsu said that the Sanitizer API can be a good complement for other security mechanisms being built into browsers, including Trusted Types, a new specification that makes it difficult to stage DOM-based XSS attacks on websites.“While Trusted Types aims to prevent DOM-based XSS, HTML sanitization had to be provided by the developers. However, with Sanitizer API, developers can simply use the built-in Sanitizer API,” he added.DON’T MISS Firefox Suggest lands in the US, bringing ads to the browser search bar",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-mozilla-close-to-finalizing-sanitizer-api-for-chrome-and-firefox-browsers,"['Browsers', 'XSS', 'Google', 'Mozilla', 'Chrome', 'firefox', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Industry', 'News', 'JavaScript', 'Vulnerabilities']"
no,Missouri governor criticized for confusing vulnerability disclosure with criminal hacking,Politician’s accusations unleash torrent of criticism and snarky memes from incredulous infosec pros,"Missouri governor Mike Parson has sparked derision among the infosec community over allegations that a journalist who reported a security vulnerability in a state government website had violated computer crime laws.The controversy relates to a story published by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Wednesday (October 13) disclosing an alleged security vulnerability in the site, which is maintained by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE).The flaws, unearthed by one of its reporters, potentially exposed more than 100,000 Social Security numbers (SSNs) belonging to teachers and other school staff, said the publication.The newspaper said it notified DESE of the flaws and delayed publication of the story to give the agency time to secure the data in question – an approach in line with vulnerability disclosure as routinely practiced by professional security researchers.Missouri’s Office of Administration Information Technology Services Division (OA-ITSD) has now disabled the vulnerable tool, which is used by local education agencies to verify educators’ certifications, and says it has fixed the vulnerability.‘No malicious intent’However, in a series of tweets posted yesterday (October 14), Governor Parson said the journalist “had no authorization to convert and decode the code” and DESEx had referred the case to the county prosecutor.Citing a Missouri state statute, he said: “Under Missouri law, a person commits the offense of tampering with computer data if her or she knowingly and without authorization accesses, takes, and examines personal information.”Read more of the latest data leak newsBut in a statement published by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, its attorney, Joseph Martineau, said “the reporter did the responsible thing by reporting his findings to DESE so that the state could act to prevent disclosure and misuse”, and that “there was no breach of any firewall or security and certainly no malicious intent”.However, Governor Parson said: “An individual accessed source code and then went a step further to convert and decode that data in order to obtain Missouri teachers’ personal information. This data was not freely available, and by the actors own admission, the data had to be taken through eight separate steps in order to generate a SSN.”‘Not a hacking situation’But Rachel Tobac, a prominent US-based hacker and infosec educator, suggested the journalist’s actions required no special technical skills: “If your code leaks personal data via public development tools that any person can see by simply pressing F12 on a keyboard then you have a huge data leak issue, not a hacking situation, on your hands. Fix your website,” she tweeted.Hitting the F12 key on a Windows computer or right-clicking on a web page enables users to view a web page’s source code.RELATED Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: What the ‘landmark’ Van Buren ruling means for security researchers“This person reported a vulnerability – a big data leak issue that anyone could see – and took time out of their day to report it to keep people safe,” said Tobac. “Changes were made to protect data, *and now they want to slap that person with criminal charges?* Absolutely not.”Ben Goerz, founder of infosec firm Guardero, tweeted: “This is more than a ‘security blunder’. @GovParsonsMO, your web developers encoded (without encryption) SSNs and displayed them openly on the web.“You have a massive data breach here. You need to engage a competent Incident Response firm & legal counsel immediately.”RemediationIn a statement, Jeff Wann, chief information officer for the State of Missouri, said: “All similarly situated public-facing systems were evaluated for this vulnerability and no other instances were found.”OA-ITSD said “a number of vulnerability scans” conducted since the 2011 launch of the vulnerable tool “did not yield any concerns or potential threats”.DESE sought to downplay the scope of the vulnerability, saying “these records were only accessible on an individual basis”, and said “the state is unaware of any misuse of individual information or even whether information was accessed inappropriately outside of this isolated incident”.The agency said the state would “make every effort to contact” potentially affected educators “to share information about the next steps”.DESE declined to comment further in response to queries from The Daily Swig.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/missouri-governor-criticized-for-confusing-vulnerability-disclosure-with-criminal-hacking,"['US', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Government', 'Industry', 'News', 'North', 'America', 'Social', 'Media', 'Education', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Database', 'Security', 'Privacy', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Analysis', 'Authentication', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Compliance']"

no,Dutch police warn DDoS-for-hire customers to desist or face prosecution,We know what you DDoSed last summer,"Dutch police have sent warning letters to 29 individuals who purchased services from a DDoS-for-hire website.The caution was sent to customers of the website www.minesearch.rip, where illegal Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks were sold.Recipients are being told in no uncertain terms that what they did was criminal. They are not being prosecuted on this occasion, but the authorities warn that the notice should be taken as a final warning that if an individual becomes tied up in similar malfeasance in future, then a criminal prosecution will follow.Legitimate alternativesRecipients of the letter – individuals who have dipped their toes into the murky world of cybercrime – are being encouraged to explore alternative, legitimate routes to learning about computer security and related topics. Various sites including a Dutch police site (https://publicaties.politie.nl/changeyourgame) and that of a well know security conference (https://www.hackthebox.eu) are offered as suggestions.Catch up on the latest cybercrime news and analysisThe warning letters to local customers of minesearch.rip follows the earlier takedown of the service and arrest of two 19 year-old suspects back in July 2020. Computer equipment seized during arrests was submitted to forensic examination and the police investigation of the case remains ongoing, as explained in a Dutch-language police statement on the latest action.The police investigation was prompted by a report from a game server that was the victim of a DDoS attack originating from minesearch.rip. The same so-called booter service has been linked to dozens of similar reports from other companies and authorities.‘Pragmatic approaches’Eddy Willems, a cybersecurity expert at anti-malware firm G Data, commented: “Personally, I would have taken action against them without sending the warning. Maybe the police force knows that the DDoS criminals are very young and is taking that in account. But seriously, the warnings are a strange strategy IMHO.”However, security researcher Martijn Grooten was more positive about the Dutch police approach. “I don't know enough details of this case to comment, but I'm all for pragmatic approaches that avoid treating kids as criminals,” Grooten commented on Twitter.The minesearch.rip. action marks the latest in a series of attempts made by Dutch authorities to clamp down on cybercrime. For example, in April last year Dutch police took down 15 DDoS-for-hire platforms.One common route into cybercrime is when gamers figure out how to turf rivals out of a game through launching a DDoS attack, before realizing that the same facility can be rebadged as a booter service and sold via cybercrime marketplaces or marketed through social media apps, such as Telegram.RELATED Cybercrime cases in the Netherlands more than doubled in 2020",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/dutch-police-warn-ddos-for-hire-customers-to-desist-or-face-prosecution,"['DDoS', 'Netherlands', 'Cybercrime', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Legal', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Gaming', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Europe']"

Medical treatment is continuing as usual, aside from non-urgent elective procedures.”Operational continuityThe Times of Israel has reported that the Health Ministry has sent a letter to hospitals across Israel advising them to print out patients’ medical files to ensure operational continuity in case of further attacks.It also reports that hospital director Mickey Dudkiewicz said attackers had not yet requested a specific ransom amount, but that Health Ministry officials believe hackers were likely motivated by financial gain rather than geopolitical goals.Israel suffered 2.5 times as many cyber-attacks as the global average in the first half of 2021, according to American-Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point.Many attacks against the country are attributed to attackers backed by Iran, including a ransomware attack against call center service company Voicenter last month, a cyber-attack that hit dozens of Israeli logistics companies in December 2020, and an attack targeting its water management systems in April 2020.The Daily Swig has sent additional queries to the INCD, the Israeli Ministry of Health, and Hillel Yaffe Medical Center.

no,Git providers revoke weak keys generated in vulnerable GitKraken crypto library,Weak SSH keys have been revoked by vendors to protect their users,"In what could have been considered a cryptographic supply chain security incident in the making, GitLab and other providers have blocked known, weak SSH keys generated through GitKraken.On October 11, the Axosoft team behind GitKraken, a cross-platform Git GUI client, said in a blog post that the organization uncovered a security flaw in an open source SSH generation library – keypair – used by the client.According to GitHub, the software was generating identical RSA keys used in SSH, leading to weak random number generation. The critical vulnerability, discovered by Axosoft’s Ross Wheeler, is tracked as CVE-2021-41117 and has been issued a CVSS severity score of 8.7.Read more of the latest open source software security newsThe cryptographic library was implemented in versions 7.6.x, 7.7.x, and 8.0.0 of GitKraken, distributed between May 12 and September 27, 2021.According to the team, the vulnerability resulted in weak, public SSH security keys being generated.“Weak keys are created with low entropy, meaning there is a higher probability of key duplication,” GitKraken says.Users of the software, therefore, may have been generating weak keys and then implemented them encrypt connections to the GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and Azure DevOps repositories.DON’T MISS Nagios XI updated to address trio of security vulnerabilitiesIn GitKraken’s disclosure, the team says the issue has been resolved as of version 8.0.1 by removing the old dependency and replacing it with a new key generation library.Users should upgrade to the latest build, but GitKraken cautions that if keys were generated through the past, vulnerable versions of the GUI, they still must be replaced – a software upgrade alone is not enough.ReactionGitKraken reached out to Git hosting providers that could be impacted further down the chain to warn them of the security flaw. The teams have since worked together to invalidate weak SSH keys found in active use.GitLab has emailed customers to make them aware of the issue and has asked self-managed customers to revoke old, GitKraken-generated SSH keys immediately.Bitbucket has also launched an investigation and has both revoked and blocked keys, preventing them from being used in the future.The Azure DevOps team found a small subset of users “with potentially insecure SSH keys” and has revoked them, informing impacted users in the process.“Where possible, the affected keys are now permanently blocked by the Git hosting service providers,” GitKraken says. “We will continue to work toward the highest security standards possible for all of our users.”As of now, no repository has found any evidence of exploitation in the wild.For instructions on how to generate new keys, GitKraken has provided separate guides for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Unresolved GitHub Actions flaw allows code to be approved without review",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/git-providers-revoke-weak-keys-generated-in-vulnerable-gitkraken-crypto-library,"['Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'GitHub', 'Industry', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Encryption', 'Authentication', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security']"
no,Unresolved GitHub Actions flaw allows code to be approved without review,Mitigations are available for yet-to-be-fixed vulnerability,"A security loophole in GitHub Actions allows software code to be automatically passed without any peer or supervisor review.The vulnerability, discovered by security researcher Omer Gil and colleagues from security startup Cider Security, circumvents security controls and exists even in the installations of organizations that have not enabled the recently introduced feature.Catch up with the latest secure development news and analysisThe team from Cider Security – a startup focused on CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) security – uncovered the issue in GitHub during research into novel attack vectors in the arena of DevOps.Gil told The Daily Swig: “Required reviews is one of the most widely used security mechanisms in GitHub, and since GitHub Actions is installed by default nearly any organization is vulnerable to this.”In a blog post on Medium, Cider Security explained how the shortcoming clears the way for a rogue developer or attackers with access to a single compromised account to push malicious code into production software by circumventing a process that would normally mandate independent checks:“A newly discovered security flaw in GitHub allows leveraging GitHub Actions to bypass the required reviews mechanism and push unreviewed code to a protected branch, potentially allowing malicious code to be used by other users or flow down the pipeline to production.”Unchecked privilegeGitHub Actions – GitHub’s CI service – offers a mechanism to build and run workflows from development to production systems. The technology is installed by default on all software repositories of organizations that use GitHub’s software development platform to manage projects.Even those with only user privileges can change workflows, therefore admin privileges are not needed to push potentially malicious code through the software process without review.“Anyone with write access to a repository can modify the permissions granted to the GITHUB_TOKEN, adding or removing access as required, by editing the permissions key in the workflow file,” Cider Security explains.These changes have a big effect when pull requests are made.“As the PR is created, it cannot be merged since approval is required. However, the workflow immediately runs and the PR is approved by the GitHub-actions bot, which the GITHUB_TOKEN belongs to,” Cider Security explains.“It’s not an organization member, but counts as PR approval, and effectively allows the attacker to approve their own PR, basically bypassing the branch protection rules.”Cider Security has produced a video (via YouTube) illustrating the hack.Cider House RulesRemediation aimed at resolving the problem is ongoing and the issue is not yet fully fixed.“GitHub’s response was standard for a bug report – I reported it through their bug bounty program, they acknowledged it, and said they’d work on a fix,” Gil said. “I asked to disclose it, and they approved.”The Daily Swig approached GitHub’s press team for comment on the issue. We’re yet to hear back but we’ll update this story as soon as more information comes to hand.In the absence of any specific advice to date from GitHub, Cider Security has come up with a list of potential mitigations. Organizations should consider disabling GitHub Actions across their whole enterprise or for specific (more sensitive) repositories.Where GitHub Actions is in use, mitigation is still possible by making changes to ensure that two code approvals are needed, for example.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Apache HTTP Server update fails to squash path traversal, RCE bugs",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/unresolved-github-actions-flaw-allows-code-to-be-approved-without-review,"['GitHub', 'DevSecOps', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'DevOps', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations']"

I’m glad we now celebrate Ada Lovelace Day because that is changing a lot. But even though I never had someone to look up to [in the industry], my family really encouraged my passion for computing even at a young age, and from that I think even though I didn’t have someone to look up to, I had a dream to look towards instead.I remember as a kid I told my dad I wanted to make Neopets, and he bought me ALL the web dev books after that! I never did remake Neopets but I think I have the skills now!DS:Why do you think Ada (Lovelace) is one of the coolest people ever?KPF:So I am kinda a computing history nerd, so in my mind the coolest thing she did was write instructions for a machine THAT DID NOT EXIST, LIKE WHAT? How do you even do that? I sometimes get errors writing hello world applications!Related: one of the reasons I am also really interested in the colossus computer from Bletchley is because it deciphered a code and the allies did not even see the machines which produced the code until after the war. Computing history is genuinely amazing.READ MORE‘I thought it was a complete fluke’ – Katie Paxton-Fear on her bug bounty baptism and why AI will never fully replace security researchersDS:If you could change one thing about the industry, what would it be?KPF:I think greater collaboration. I was a dev [developer] for a time and I definitely had the not a ‘me problem’ attitude. Security was simply someone else’s problem. And then I was the only one in when the production servers got ransomwared and I had no idea what to do apart from panic.This doesn’t stop at tech though: I know a lot of folks through my knitting club who aren’t great with computers so I try to help out with their security when I can and give them some advice.P.s my solution for the ransomware was simply to turn off the server and cower behind my boss as he sent the entire company home early.Ada Lovelace, as sketched here, is considered the pioneer of computing programmingDS:What do you think about the trend of researchers giving a vulnerability a name, logo, website etc – is this necessary?KPF:So as someone who is dyslexic I cannot remember a single CVE number, but I can remember ImageTragick which I think is a pro. I know it’s a bit dramatic overall. I really do think the names help users and practitioners communicate without confusion.I wish we had more soft and cuddly names instead of what could be death metal band names. Where is the ‘sparkle unicorn friendship attack’?DS:What are your thoughts on the new OWASP top 10?KPF:Oh this is going to get me in trouble! I overall like the top 10, but I think it represents a general trend of lumping all web dev together but with that it ends up being very general. Maybe like we have an API top 10 we should have a JavaScript top 10, enterprise top 10 etc to better describe the hodgepodge of tech the modern internet has become.I am glad to see SSRF get a mention, I think it’s somewhat misunderstood, and I do think ‘Injection’ as a catch all is more ‘future proof’ than XSS/SQLi. Plus I think using a data driven approach was a good call overall.DON’T MISSInfosec pro Vandana Verma on improving diversity and helping to grow the Indian security communityDS:Is it okay to have experience in any sub-domain of IT (e.g. tech support, dev, testing) before stepping into security roles? Will companies actually consider those people?KPF:Yeah for sure. I think it’s all about how you position your career, really making sure you go for every opportunity you can, if your employer gets attacked, you can make the point that training you would be a good way to prevent it in the future. It will take time though, and it’s important in job interviews to not lie about your experience but look at how being in support for example can transition into security (e.g empathy for users). Things like bug bounty [participation] can help a ton in getting experience outside of work!DS:How did you get started in cybersecurity? What suggestions would you have for others starting out fresh?KPF:I think my biggest advice is to not to get attached to one field right away, spend some time figuring out what about security really sparks joy for you. There are SO MANY careers in security from techies to creatives to people-people and everyone in-between, it can be easy to get overwhelmed, so I’ve found friends and mentor figures have really helped guide me and advise on what opportunities are out there. And while I may never do forensics and investigate a crime scene, the experience was really fun and I had a blast learning!Read more of the latest bug bounty newsDS:What made you decide you wanted to work in infosec?KPF:I kinda ended up here accidentally a little, I finished Uni and got a graduate job doing software engineering and data science, and one day at lunch I realized wow I don’t like my job, and decided to apply for a PhD. Now unfortunately I realized this in October and PhD admissions were closed.So I didn’t have a lot of choice in my field (natural language processing), I went for the PhD that combined both NLP and infosec and originally it was just a domain for my work, but within a year I found myself really interested in security!DS:[What is] the first bug that a beginner with basic knowledge in bug hunting can start learning?KPF:I cannot stress this enough, IDORs! They don’t require technical skills, just perseverance and they are EVERYWHERE.Seriously they are one of the most common bugs and while the impact of some can be low, depending on the organization they can be high or critical, especially with the current direction of the modern web – I think they will take over XSS. Best way to find them is to sign up with two accounts and see if you can do actions to account A while using the cookies of account B.Katie's YouTube channel provides free hacking education tools and resourcesDS:What is one thing you suggest infosec people do to take some time off and relax?KPF:I think it’s important to have a hobby away from the computer. I can’t stress how much getting away from the computer helps me to think and process as well as randomly get inspiration. I really enjoy knitting because I like to create and it’s nice to have a thing to point at and go, ‘Hey I made that!’.I can’t stress how important it is to take time off and manage your work-life balance, especially if you’re a student or starting a business, it’s really easy to let it take over and feel bad when not working but it’s essential to being successful.Also my mum doesn’t understand anything about computers and I can’t stress how useful she is for chatting through my problems. My partner often teases me about me treating him and my mum as code ducks when I have problems!DS:What class of vulnerabilities are you studying at the moment?KPF:Ooh great question, I’m currently learning about vulnerabilities that targets AI/ML and data science more broadly. We’re often rushing to put in fancy algorithms that are deployed without thinking about security concerns. We can all laugh at GitHub co-pilot finding API keys but there are many of types of vulnerability that affect AI/ML systems and many have privacy risks!Web wise I’m really trying to drill into HTTP request smuggling for a video. I think I understand it and then I’ll try to write it and realize I don’t quite get it. Me and HTTP have an off again, on again relationship.DS:And finally Katie, do you have any final words of advice for our followers?KPF:Thank you for having me!

No,Nagios XI updated to address trio of security vulnerabilities,Post-auth flaws could give attackers a platform from which to pivot to other parts of the network,"Three vulnerabilities have been addressed in Nagios XI, which monitors mission-critical enterprise infrastructure components.Nagios XI monitors applications, services, operating systems, network protocols, systems metrics, and network infrastructure, and has privileged access to network and server configuration and reporting.Researchers at the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center discovered medium-severity SQL injection, path traversal, and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that could be exploited by authenticated attackers.‘Tempting target’“ An attacker would need an initial foothold in the system through which to target them, which is why they have a ‘medium’ rating in the advisory,” Scott Tolley, the Synopsys security engineer who discovered the vulnerabilities, tells The Daily Swig.“However, the nature of network monitoring software such as Nagios is that is has privileged access to a lot of assets on the target network. That makes them a very tempting target for attackers looking to pivot to other parts of an already compromised system.”The first flaw, CVE-2021-33177, allows an authenticated user with access to the bulk modifications tool, such as admin, to inject arbitrary SQL into an UPDATE statement. In the default configuration, this allows execution of arbitrary PostgreSQL functions.Read more of the latest enterprise security news and analysisMeanwhile, a path traversal vulnerability in the NagVis reporting module (CVE-2021-33178) allows an attacker with access to the NagVis ManageBackgrounds endpoint, such as admin, to delete arbitrary files on the server limited by the rights of the Apache server effective user.“The user is given the opportunity to delete a background image,” says Tolley.“Unfortunately, with a few extra characters in the request the attacker can point to any file on the system and the application will happily delete it. This can have implications for the availability of the software, and possibly the security as well, depending on what files the attacker chooses to delete.”Finally, a reflected XSS on the core config manager (CVE-2021-33179) could enable a malicious URL to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim’s browser and surface local session data from Nagios XI.Synopsys alerted Nagios to all three vulnerabilities on May 12, and fixes were issued on July 15, September 2, and June 10 respectively.“Nagios were extremely responsive and pleasant to deal with.

No,"Firefox Suggest lands in the US, bringing ads to the browser search bar",New feature has been rolled out to a select group of users in the US,"Mozilla’s Firefox is styled as a privacy-centric browser, but a new feature may send more data to the organization than you would like.Firefox 93 started to land on users’ systems on October 5, bringing with it a range of privacy and security enhancements.These included a default block placed on potentially insecure HTTP downloads from HTTPS pages, sandboxed iframe downloads prohibition, and the introduction of SmartBlock 3.0, a tracking protection feature.Amid these advances, the latest stable branch of the browser also introduced Firefox Suggest – and this change has not been met warmly by all parties.‘A trustworthy guide’Introduced on September 15, Firefox Suggest is described by Mozilla as a feature for clearing up clickbait, decluttering the web, and getting people where they want to go quickly.The system, built directly into the browser, is what Mozilla calls a “trustworthy guide to the better web, surfacing relevant information and sites to help people accomplish their goals”.“Firefox Suggest will enhance this [search] by including other sources of information such as Wikipedia, Pocket articles, reviews, and credible content from sponsored, vetted partners and trusted organizations,” the organization says.“Users outside of the US will have local results only (browsing history, bookmarks, and open tab suggestions).”DEEP DIVES What does the future hold for browser security? The latest features destined for mobile and desktopSpeaking to The Daily Swig, Mozilla spokesperson Ellen Canale said Firefox Suggest with smarter contextual suggestions has, so far, been rolled out to a “very small percentage of US users” who can allow it if a prompt appears.If a prompt has not appeared, the feature has not been included in what the spokesperson calls the “study”.Sponsored contentFirefox already offers search bar suggestions, but the Suggest feature takes this a step further by offering sponsored content from partners vetted by Mozilla based on what you're searching for.If users are prompted and opt-in to the new offering in the Firefox suggest experience, Search queries, city-level location data, and whether or not a user clicks on a suggestion (and which suggestion) are collected and sent to partners through one of Mozilla’s proxy services.Mozilla says that no personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, and other data points are only used in ways that the user has consented to.“The sponsored content the majority of US users are likely seeing does not include access to any new data types and can be turned off at any time,” the spokesperson added.Read more of the latest browser security news“Data collection needed to provide the service is only enabled if the users offered the experience explicitly opt-in through a prompt.”Firefox Suggest is intended to be customizable, but the issue is that in the latest release, there is confusion over whether or not the feature has been enabled or not.“We’ve heard the feedback that it’s difficult to verify when these smarter contextual suggestions are available or enabled,” Canale said. “We are working to improve the experience to make this clearer.”Mozilla says that each ad partner – such as adMarketplace – must meet Firefox’s vetting standards. Results from Wikipedia, which is not sponsored, may also appear.How to disable Firefox SuggestTo see if you are opted-in to Contextual suggestions after updating your Firefox build, you can go to Preferences > Privacy & Security > Address Bar > Firefox Suggest.If the Contextual suggestions string (‘Firefox will have access to your location, search queries, and visited sites’) has been checked, you can also choose to uncheck this and disable the feature.“If you do not see that label then the default experience is enabled with no new kinds of data sharing,” Mozilla says.RELATED Firefox 93 lands with HTTP download blocking, new user privacy featuresUnder Contextual suggestions you will also find a tab for “Include occasional sponsored suggestions” – and it is this option you want to uncheck to stop sponsored ads from appearing.The Firefox team has acknowledged the concerns around sponsored ads appearing, which arguably could undermine the browser’s privacy-based foundation.“We get it,” Canale told us. “We also want to provide a choice for people who want a purpose-driven and independent company to create software for them that provides real privacy, transparency, and valuable help with navigating today’s internet.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/firefox-suggest-lands-in-the-us-bringing-ads-to-the-browser-search-bar,"['Browsers', 'Mozilla', 'Privacy', 'Industry', 'News', 'firefox', 'Surveillance', 'Organizations', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'US', 'North', 'America']"

yes,NSA warns of heightened wildcard TLS certificate risk,Wild Alpaca peril,"The US National Security Agency (NSA) is warning organizations to avoid using wildcard digital encryption certificates in order to minimize the risk from a new form of TLS traffic decryption attacks.As they cover multiple domains, so-called ‘wildcard’ TLS certificates remove the need for an organization to obtain a certificate for every subdomain they own.While common practice among enterprises, wildcard certs were recently revealed to open the door to a hacking technique dubbed ‘ALPACA’ (Application Layer Protocols Allowing Cross-Protocol Attack).NSA warning“Wildcard certificates have legitimate uses, but can confer risk from poorly secured servers to other servers in the same certificate’s scope,” warned an alert (PDF) from the NSA this week.ALPACA is a technique used to exploit hardened web applications through non-HTTP services secured using the same or a similar Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate.Catch up on the latest encryption-related news and analysisThis attack, discovered in June and demonstrated at Black Hat USA, allows threat actors to confuse machine identities that run multiple protocols and trick servers to respond to encrypted HTTPS requests via unencrypted protocols.These unencrypted responses offer a means for miscreants to capture cookies and private user data.Don’t show your handThe use of wildcard certificates to verify web server identities during the TLS handshake process increases the risk from ALPACA-style attacks, so administrators are urged to review their environments and check their usage.Wildcard certificates have long been frowned upon from a secure development perspective, but the NSA’s latest announcement acts as an indication that this attack vector may be one to watch over the coming months.Kevin Bocek, vice president of security strategy and threat intelligence at Venafi, commented: “Typically, organisations use wildcard certificates to reduce costs and because security teams find them helpful to manage their machine identities.”Bocek continued: “However, it is a double-edged sword: because they are so easy to use, often security teams forget to monitor them regularly. Without proper security, control, and monitoring of wildcard certificates cybercriminals can exploit them in other attacks – such as phishing.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Ransomware forensics research reveals cybercrime tradecraft secrets",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nsa-warns-of-heightened-wildcard-tls-certificate-risk,"['Encryption', 'TLS', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Government', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Browsers', 'Privacy', 'MitM', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Certification']"

no,Ransomware forensics research reveals cybercrime tradecraft secrets,Resident REvil,"Research into the hacking techniques that result in companies being infected with ransomware offers organizations some useful pointers towards how best to avoid this increasingly common form of cyber-attack.Ransomware attacks have grown at an alarming rate over the last few years, driven by the proliferation in strains of malware and the emergence of affiliate programs that bring less skilled cybercriminals into play, among other factors.The basic scam – breaking into systems and encrypting data before extorting victims into paying for decryption keys – is so lucrative (partly because of the growing utility and value of cryptocurrencies) that it has fueled development of a diverse and growing cybercrime ecosystem.Setting the sceneAnalytical research from Security Scorecard, presented at the VB2021 security conference last week, reports that 20 different ransomware families threaten to publicly expose the data belonging to companies that are unwilling to pay the ransom cybercriminals demand.Attackers typically use Tor domains to disclose the identity of the companies they’ve infected as well as to upload files they’ve stolen before starting the encryption process.Catch up on the latest ransomware-related news and analysisResearchers from US-based Security Scorecard scoured Tor websites maintained by the attackers in order to gain intelligence on attacks against non-paying victims.The firm looked at ransomware-linked data leak websites to gather a list of companies known to have been victims of ransomware.Happy families?Around 750 companies had their data leaked following ransomware infection between March and May 2021, according to work by the Security Scorecard team.Conti, Avaddon, and REvil were the most common vectors of these leaks but several other ransomware families were involved too.The number of ransomware attacks continues to skyrocketThe same researchers sinkholed unused command and control domains tied to particular ransomware families in order to get a secondary source of data for active ransomware attacks.Ransomware infects systems through other malware families or exploit kits, exposed network services, software vulnerabilities, and spam campaigns proffering malware-tainted messages, among other techniques.For example, infections by the Emotet malware are “highly correlated” with ransomware infections, a finding researchers reached after analyzing network traffic sent to malware command and control servers.RELATED REvil infrastructure disappearance sparks speculation about fate of infamous ransomware slingersCobalt Strike – a legitimate pen testing tool with dual use capabilities – is frequently used by ransomware authors, according to Security Scorecard.“By correlating the victims of these malware families and exploit kits, the entities running these vulnerable services, as well as the entities that have poor email hygiene with the victims of ransomware attacks, we can estimate the risk those exposures added to the probability of ransomware infection,” said the firm.The Daily Swig asked Security Scorecard a number of questions about its research but we’re yet to hear back from the researchers.

no,Ransom Disclosure Act: US bill mandates organizations to report ransomware payments,Newly proposed law hopes to further understanding of cybercrime landscape,"UPDATED US Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed a new piece of legislation that will force organizations to disclose when and how much they have paid to ransomware gangs.Last week, together with Representative Deborah Ross, Warren announced the Ransom Disclosure Act, which aims to provide the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with critical data on ransomware payments in order to “bolster our [the government’s] understanding of how cybercriminal enterprises operate and develop a fuller picture of the ransomware threat”.Warren said the reporting of ransomware payouts will help the government “to learn how much money cybercriminals are siphoning from American entities to finance criminal enterprises – and help us go after them”.DisclosureIf passed, the bill would require ransomware victims (excluding individuals) to disclose information about ransom payments no later than 48 hours after the date of payment, including the amount of ransom demanded and paid, the type of currency used for payment, and any known information about the entity demanding the ransom.Read more of the latest ransomware newsIt will also require the DHS to publicly report the information disclosed during the previous year, excluding identifying information about the entities that paid ransoms, and to establish a website through which individuals can voluntarily report payment of ransoms.The law will also mandate the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out a study focused on finding patterns among ransomware attacks and the extent to which cryptocurrency facilitated these attacks, and to provide recommendations for protecting information systems and strengthening cybersecurity.Increasing attacksA news release from Warren’s team noted the rising frequency of ransomware attacks across the nation.Between 2019 and 2020, the release said that ransomware attacks rose by 158% in North America.In 2020, it reported, the FBI received nearly 2,500 ransomware complaints, up 20% from 2019 and accounting for losses of over $29 million.This is evident by the increasing number of ransomware attacks impacting predominantly the healthcare, education, and critical infrastructure industries in the US.Callum Roxan, head of threat intelligence at F-Secure, commented: “Governments know ransomware is a problem, but just how much of a problem is unclear. Compulsory reporting of ransomware payments can help shed light on the true scale of the problem and not just the tip of the iceberg we see reported in the media.“The legislation may run in to issues on reporting based on how and where organizations decide to pay the ransom. If they organise payment through and intemediary will they have to report?“If they pay the ransom from a company in their portfolio that is not under US jurisdiction (aka abroad) will they have to declare? There will always be ways round this type of legislation, but if constructed well it can have a positive impact on informing government of the real scope of the issue.“The most interesting aspect of the suggested legislation is the directive to the DHS to investigate the cryptocurrency facilitation of ransomware. This may spark further legislation and focus on this medium by the US government. It certainly will help arm it with the information it needs to decide if this is an effective avenue for combatting ransomware.”This article has been updated to include further comment.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE US policy change states healthcare apps must follow data breach notification rules",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ransom-disclosure-act-us-bill-mandates-organizations-to-report-ransomware-payments,"['US', 'Ransomware', 'Cybercrime', 'Organizations', 'Government', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Legal', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Healthcare', 'Education', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'North', 'America', 'Malware', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Cyber', 'Warfare']"

no,Hong Kong’s anti-doxxing law comes into force despite human rights criticism,Violations could attract hefty fines and up to five years in prison,"UPDATED Hong Kong’s controversial new anti-doxxing law, which criminalizes the non-consensual disclosure of individuals’ sensitive personal data, has come into effect despite opposition from both technology firms and privacy advocates.Effective October 8, the law gives the regional government’s privacy watchdog powers to prosecute doxxing-related offences, with offenders potentially liable for jail terms of up to five years and fines of up to HK$1 million (US$128,200).“Anyone who discloses the personal data of another person without consent, whether recklessly or with intent to cause specified harm to the person or his or her family, such as harassment, molestation, pestering, threat, intimidation, bodily or psychological harm or damage to property, commits the offence of doxxing,” said the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD), the domestic data protection regulator.The harshest penalties are imposed if victims suffer harassment, intimidation, physical or psychological harm, damage to their property, or a threat to their safety or wellbeing.The law, an amendment (PDF) to the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance 2021, was passed by Hong Kong's legislature on September 29.Pro-democracy protestsThe amendment was drafted in the wake of a surge in doxxing-related incidents during pro-democracy protests that convulsed the special administrative region (SAR) in 2019, as reported by The Daily Swig in January 2020.Sparked by a controversial treaty that enabled the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, the protests saw numerous demonstrators investigated for sharing photos and other personal data online of what protestors claimed were rogue police officers.BACKGROUND Hong Kong aims to tackle doxxing with overhaul of data privacy lawsPolice officers were themselves accused of doxxing too, with two reported instances involving the live streaming of videos in which journalists’ identity cards were visible.The PCPD says it has handled more than 5,800 doxxing cases between the very first report in June 2019 and the end of June 2021, and has detailed a number of convictions under the previous legal framework.“Doxxing acts have become rampant and personal data has been weaponised since 2019 in Hong Kong,” the PCPD told The Daily Swig.The amendment “aims to combat doxxing acts that are intrusive to personal data privacy,"" it added. “The legislature and the Hong Kong SAR government have made reference to relevant laws in other jurisdictions, including Singapore, Australia and New Zealand during the legislative process.”‘Not aligned with global norms’The PCPD is also empowered to conduct searches on online service providers’ electronic equipment, order arrests without a warrant, and request that content be removed from websites hosted outside Hong Kong. Failure to comply could see local representatives face up to HK$100,000 in fines and two years’ imprisonment.These provisions have provoked alarm among tech firms, which fear staff could be exposed to the risk of prosecution over the publication of user-submitted content.The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), a Singapore-based trade association that represents Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Amazon, explained its concerns in a letter sent to the Hong Kong government in June.Read more of the latest data privacy news and breaches“Introducing sanctions aimed at individuals is not aligned with global norms and trends,” it said, warning that technology companies might be tempted to “refrain from investing and offering their services in Hong Kong” as a result.However, the PCPD told The Daily Swig: “The Privacy Commissioner met with representatives of the [AIC] in early July 2021 and there was a good exchange of views between the parties. The representatives of the AIC reaffirmed that doxxing is a matter of serious concern and that it is necessary to combat doxxing in order to protect personal data privacy”.Having criticized a National Security Law passed in 2020 for curtailing freedom of speech and protest, human rights and pro-democracy groups are similarly concerned the anti-doxxing legislation is yet another tool for stifling dissent.‘Clear, focused and target-specific’But the PCPD commented: “The Amendment Ordinance has struck a reasonable balance between the protection of privacy and freedom of speech, and will not affect the freedom of speech and free flow of information that members of the public currently enjoy. It has no bearing on normal and lawful business activities in Hong Kong.”The PCPD added that other proposed amendments to Hong Kong’s 1996 privacy law – including establishing a mandatory data breach notification mechanism, data retention period, powers to impose administrative fines, and regulation of data processors – are still being considered.This article was updated on October 16 with additional comments from the PCPD.RELATED OPPA: Ohio could become the third US state to enact a new consumer privacy law in 2021",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/hong-kongs-anti-doxxing-law-comes-into-force-despite-human-rights-criticism,"['Hong', 'Kong', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Privacy', 'Censorship', 'Surveillance', 'Legal', 'China', 'Social', 'Media', 'Google', 'Amazon', 'Facebook', 'Asia', 'North', 'America', 'US', 'Analysis', 'Industry', 'News']"

No,OPPA: Ohio could become the third US state to enact a new consumer privacy law in 2021,"Ohio Personal Privacy Act will grant Ohioans an expansive set of new rights, writes US attorney David Oberly","State legislatures in the US have been busy this year, with both Virginia and Colorado passing new consumer privacy statutes mirroring the now well-known California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).And there may be further, similarly momentous changes to the privacy legal landscape before the year is over, after Buckeye State legislators recently introduced their own consumer privacy bill.The Ohio Personal Privacy Act (OPPA) has strong support from Ohio’s governor and lieutenant governor, increasing the likelihood that the Midwestern state may soon join the ranks of a growing number of states with consumer privacy statutes on the books.If enacted, the OPPA would provide an expansive set of new rights to Ohio consumers, and impose a corresponding set of stringent obligations on businesses that collect and handle their data.The OPPA: Scope and applicabilitySimilar to the CCPA and other consumer privacy statutes, businesses would have to meet certain thresholds to fall under the scope of the OPPA.Specifically, the law applies to any business that conducts operations in Ohio or produces goods/services targeted at Ohio consumers and satisfies one or more of the following criteria:Annual gross revenue generated in Ohio above $25 million.Controls or processes the personal data of 100,000 or more consumers during the calendar year.Derives more than 50% of its gross revenue from the sale of personal data and processes/controls the personal data of 25,000 or more consumers during a calendar year.Consumer rightsLike other consumer privacy statutes, the OPPA grants consumers a broad range of rights, including:Right to know: The right to know the personal data that a business collects pertaining to a given consumer.Right to access: The right to request access to, and the disclosure of, the personal data that a business collects about the consumer.Right to deletion: The right to request that a business delete the personal data that the business has collected from the consumer for commercial purposes.Right to opt-out: The right to request that a business that sells personal data to third parties will not sell the consumer’s personal data.Non-discrimination right: The right to not be discriminated against by a business for exercising any of the rights provided to consumers under the OPPA.Privacy noticesThe OPPA also requires businesses to give notice to consumers regarding the personal data that they process. Unlike other privacy statutes, however, the OPPA provides that a failure to maintain a privacy notice that reflects the entity’s data processing practices to a reasonable degree of accuracy constitutes an unfair or deceptive practice under Ohio law.Affirmative defenseBy far the most significant aspect of the proposed bill is an affirmative defense offered to businesses which maintain a written privacy program that reasonably conforms with the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) privacy framework.Read more of the latest data privacy newsBusinesses that satisfy requirements for the affirmative defense are afforded protection from any cause of action brought under Ohio laws, or in Ohio courts, alleging a violation of the OPPA or similar claims based on alleged violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act’s privacy-related provisions.Liability and enforcementThe OPPA does not offer a private right of action for individuals to pursue litigation against entities for alleged violations of the law. Rather, enforcement authority rests exclusively with the Ohio attorney general, who may seek civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.However, before initiating an enforcement action, the AG must give at least 30 days’ notice to cure any alleged violations.Compliance tipsWith the support of the state’s governor and lieutenant governor, buttressed by the success of other states in swiftly moving consumer privacy bills through the legislative process this year, the Buckeye State may well become the third US state to pass a new consumer privacy statute in 2021.From a broader perspective, the increasing momentum for consumer privacy laws across the globe should serve as a reminder for all companies to take proactive steps to build out a comprehensive privacy and data protection program.Specifically, companies should consider implementing the following measures if they have not already done so:Complete a data-mapping and inventory exercise.Properly inform consumers of the entity’s data processing activities through the implementation of a publicly-available privacy policy and just-in-time notices where required.Design and implement processes and procedures for responding to consumer requests.Ensure the maintenance of a robust data security program – ideally one designed in conformity with a universally-recognized security framework, such as NIST’s privacy framework or the ISO:27001 information security standard.Update service provider and vendor contracts to include language limiting the processing of personal data by the service provider to that which is required to perform services for the company.And consult with experienced privacy counsel to ensure compliance with today’s constantly-evolving privacy legal landscape.?RECOMMENDED What does the future hold for browser security?

no,Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in child monitoring app Canopy ‘could risk location leak’,Pair of unpatched security bugs are ‘just the tip of the iceberg’,"A security researcher has reported multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in a child monitoring app that could leak data including a minor’s location.Tripwire’s Craig Young said that he discovered the security flaws in Canopy after the application was advertised to him by his child’s school.Canopy allows parents to control how much screen time their children have on a device, manage the device itself and all communications, and prevent the child from accessing inappropriate content.Risky behaviorIn a blog post, Young detailed how he discovered not one but three persistent XSS vulnerabilities – two of which remain unpatched – that could allow a malicious actor to access and control the app.The researcher found that a child’s request explanation can contain XSS which executes in dashboard, a parent’s rejection explanation can contain XSS which executes on a kid’s phone, and a URL referenced in a request can contain XSS which is executed in the dashboard.An attacker with knowledge of these flaws could inject a new script into the dashboard for any or all Canopy parent accounts, Young told The Daily Swig.This could give them access to a whole host of data belonging to the family, including the child’s location.“I think a more likely scenario though is that someone would monetize the exploit by selling data dumps, injecting advertisements, or mining Monero,” explained Young.Young said the issues were all very deliberate findings, and that the first two used “nothing more than a regular <script> tag, while the last one only required some extra characters to confuse a naïve filter”.Rough disclosureYoung described the disclosure process as “rough”, telling The Daily Swig that he tried to email his findings three times and was eventually told that all issues were fixed – however, he said, this is not the case.Canopy has so far only patched the child-to-parent XSS, Young added.“On September 21, I confirmed that the child to parent XSS has been fixed but that the other two issues persist, and provided another set of details for reproducing the issue. They have been unresponsive since and I do not have an account now to see if anything has changed,” Young said.The researcher eventually took his findings public and has advised users not to use the products, claiming he believes this disclosure to be “just the tip of the iceberg”.Read more of the latest news about security vulnerabilitiesYoung said: “JavaScript blocking extensions can be helpful at thwarting XSS payloads but the best protection for a Canopy customer is to stop being a Canopy customer.“I performed a very narrowly scoped security audit looking specifically for XSS and nothing else.“The fact that I was successful at finding XSS literally everywhere I looked, leads me to believe that it may just be the tip of the iceberg.”The Daily Swig has reached out to Canopy and will update this article if and when more information comes to hand.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE OnionShare: Secure communications platform used by whistleblowers and journalists patches data exposure bug",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/multiple-xss-vulnerabilities-in-child-monitoring-app-canopy-could-risk-location-leak,"['XSS', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Mobile', 'Privacy', 'Zero-day', 'Research', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'JavaScript', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques']"
Yes,"Firefox 93 lands with HTTP download blocking, new user privacy features",Roadblocks erected against untrusted content and unwanted ads,"Mozilla has added a number of security features that collectively serve to bolster the security of its Firefox browser.Potentially insecure HTTP downloads from HTTPS page will be blocked by default by Firefox 93, which started to land on user’s desktops as a stable branch release yesterday (October 5).In addition, downloads initiated from sandboxed iframes will be blocked, unless the 'allow-downloads' attribute is set.The measures are designed to protect against insecure downloads for users of the latest version of Firefox, as explained in a blog post by Mozilla.Anti-track defensesFirefox 93 also disables Triple DES by default, deprecating an obsolete encryption algorithm.Other changes mean that Firefox 93 debuts improved privacy protections with SmartBlock 3.0.If Private Browsing and Strict Tracking Protection are engaged, the SmartBlock will block third-party scripts, images, and other content from “cross-site tracking companies reported by Disconnect”.This is not an ad blocking technology as such, but rather an approach that blocks tracking technologies used by some ad slingers, as explained in another blog post by Mozilla.DEEP DIVES What does the future hold for browser security? Check out the latest features destined for mobile and desktopThe latest version of the open source browser also features new referrer tracking protections that mean Firefox 93 will prevent websites from downgrading referrer policies for cross-site requests when Strict Tracking Protection and Private Browsing is activated.The browser will also trim the HTTP referrer for cross-site requests, regardless of the website’s settings.Gareth Hayes, a browser technology security expert and security researcher at PortSwigger, the parent company of The Daily Swig, welcomed Mozilla's browser security improvements.""These are good changes, sandboxed iframes are often used to embed untrusted content - usually adverts,"" Hayes commented. ""Preventing sandbox iframes from downloading files definitely improves security and prevents malicious adverts from forcing a download on the user.""Catch up with the latest browser security newsThe security researcher continued: ""Blocking HTTP downloads is another good feature because someone on the same network could change your download.""Stricter referrer controls will also improve user privacy for Firefox users, according to Hayes, tightening up features that debuted with Firefox 87.Hayes explained: ""The referrer change is also good for security, any cross-site requests in Firefox 93 will not send the full referrer. This means, for example, that when you search for something on a web site and click a link to another site it cannot see the query you did on the other site by looking at the referrer.""Released yesterday (October 5), Firefox 93 comes bundled with several security fixes, including mitigations for a use-after-free bug in MessageTask, along with several high-severity memory safety issues.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Safari adds strict CSP support, catches up with other leading browsers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/firefox-93-lands-with-http-download-blocking-new-user-privacy-features,"['Browsers', 'firefox', 'Mozilla', 'Privacy', 'Industry', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Encryption', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'XS-Leak']"

The team conducted an independent assessment of the software and uncovered two bugs, tracked as CVE-2021-41868 and CVE-2021-41867, which exist in versions of the software prior to v.2.4.CVE-2021-41868 was found in OnionShare’s file upload mechanism. By default, OnionShare generates random usernames and passwords in Basic Auth at startup in non-public mode, IHTeam says, and so uploading functionality should only be limited to those with the right credentials.However, while analyzing the receive_mode.py function, the team found that a logic issue caused files to be uploaded and stored remotely before an authentication check took place.DON’T MISS Mission accomplished: Security plugin HTTPS Everywhere to be deprecated in 2022The second vulnerability reported by the Italian security team, CVE-2021-41867, could be exploited to disclose the participants of a chat session. This problem, found in OnionShare’s -chat parameter (chat_mode.py), allowed websocket connections from unauthenticated users, whether or not they owned a Flask session cookie.“It seems that without a valid session ID it was not possible to intercept messages between users, since the system heavily [relies] on the session to connect into the default room – and without a valid one, messages remain undelivered to unauthenticated users,” the disclosing researcher Simone ‘d0td0tslash’ said.“It is however recommended to avoid initiating a socket.io connection without prior validating the session cookie.”OnionShare developers have now tackled both issues and released a new version of the software, v.2.4, on September 17.Discussing the disclosure, OnionShare creator Micah Lee told The Daily Swig: “Both of those advisories are pretty low risk because the attacker is required to know the onion address but not the password – something that’s not very likely to happen since both the onion address and the password part of the same URL that people would share.“But that said, I very much appreciate IHTeam digging into our code hunting for bugs, and I hope others do the same in the future.”This article has been updated to include comment from Micah Lee.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Critical encryption vulnerability found in secure communications platform Matrix",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/onionshare-secure-communications-platform-used-by-whistleblowers-and-journalists-patches-data-exposure-bug,"['Privacy', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Authentication', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Tor', 'Windows', 'Linux', 'Apple', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Surveillance', 'Censorship', 'Passwords', 'Python']"
No,"Safari adds strict CSP support, catches up with other leading browsers",Apple offers users greater defense against XSS and other vulnerabilities,"Safari, the default browser for Apple devices, will soon employ a much-needed security feature to better protect against script-injection attacks.According to a thread on the bug-tracking platform for WebKit, the browser engine that powers Safari, Apple’s developers have added support for strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to WebKit Nightly, the preview release of the engine.Discussions concerning the addition of the strict CSP have been ongoing since 2018, the thread shows.The technical detailContent Security Policy is an HTTP response header that sets restrictions on JavaScript, CSS, and other client-side resources allowed by the browser. CSP is mainly used to stop cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other script-related attacks.The original CSP specification was inflexible and limited, which forced developers to make compromises on the security of their web applications. Strict CSP, marked by the strict-dynamic directive, addresses these shortcomings.“Without strict-dynamic, the CSP has to include a list of hosts where the page is allowed to load scripts from,” Dominic Couture, senior application security engineer at GitLab, told The Daily Swig.“This is a tedious task and there are risks of CSP bypasses if the attacker is able to host scripts on one of the allow-listed hosts.”DON’T MISS What does the future hold for browser security? Check out the latest features destined for mobile and desktopStrict CSP uses an unpredictable random value called a ‘nonce’ that the web application safely generates on the server-side to validate the scripts used on the page.The strict specification makes CSP more manageable for developers and XSS exploits more difficult for attackers.“Strict CSP strikes the balance between security and flexibility for developers. Therefore, it should make CSP easier to deploy while maintaining security,” browser security engineer Jun Kokatsu told The Daily Swig.Catching upOther major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge have been supporting this feature for a long time. Safari’s lack of support for strict-dynamic has been a point of frustration for developers who wanted to secure their websites across all platforms.“This is very significant for iOS users, where all browsers are forced to use Safari’s rendering engine (i.e. WebKit),” Kokatsu said.“In many websites where they chose to deploy Strict CSP, all iOS users were getting fallback CSP mitigation which was basically to allow any scripts (due to Safari not supporting strict-dynamic).”Couture added: “This new support for strict-dynamic will make CSP maintenance easier for engineers thanks to feature-parity across all the major browsers.“With that said, the biggest impact is for Safari users, who will be more secure on the internet as they will benefit from the same security features as the users of other browsers.”READ MORE Better future?

yes,Let’s Encrypt root cert update catches out many big-name tech firms,Back on the chain gang,"UPDATED The expiration of Let’s Encrypt's root certificate last week threw up a number of problems, though not perhaps in the areas predicted ahead of the event.A legacy certificate used by the certificate authority – the IdentTrust DST Root CA X3 – expired on September 30.Let’s Encrypt saw this issue coming more than two years ago, repeatedly advising its community and subscribers on how to move over to a new root cert.BACKGROUND Device 'breakage' concerns persist days before Let’s Encrypt root cert expiryThe non-profit delayed the transition earlier this year in order to allow updates for Android to become available, and in the interests of making the changeover as smooth as possible.Digital SSL certificates that underpin the HTTPS protocol are issued by trusted certificate authorities, with indexes updated through operating system updates.If these indexes have not been updated, then affected systems will fail to recognize the new Let’s Encrypt root certificate – thereby breaking the chain of trust between a website and a user’s browser.By way of example, the AddTrust External CA Root expired in May 2020, leaving multiple organizations with problems as a result.Unchained melodyLast week's Let’s Encrypt root cert change also proved to be a bumpy road.Issues arose not so much because of clients running obsolete versions of operating systems, but because the servers of several organizations failed to serve updated certificate chains to clients due to configuration problems.Web security expert Scott Helme – who posted a detailed blog post warning of potential trouble with the Let’s Encrypt root cert shortly before the event – helped us survey the wreckage.Ahead of the event, Helme had predicted that slightly older devices and software, particularly systems depending on OpenSSL 1.0.2, could be at risk. Let’s Encrypt previously expressed concerns about older Android devices.Chain of foolsAs it turned out, systems depending on OpenSSL 1.02 (which has been obsolete since December 2019) accounted for the majority of issue with the Let’s Encrypt root cert transition logged so far.Big companies with an issue included: Palo Alto, Bluecoat, Cisco Umbrella, Catchpoint, Guardian Firewall, Monday.com, PFsense, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure Application Gateway, OVH, Auth0, Shopify, Xero, QuickBooks, Fortinet, Heroku, Rocket League, InstaPage, cPanel, Ledger, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, Sophos, AWS, and DigitalOcean.OpenBSD issued an alert on the Let’s Encrypt issue.Read more of the latest browser security newsMost of the issues might be categorized as glitches, and the problem is largely in hand. However, anything that affects the fragile chain of trust that underpins e-commerce and much else ought to be a concern.Issues for Fortinet users are more gnarly than the norm, even though the firm has since offered a workaround, as detailed in an advisory from the network security appliance firm:The issue being seen by Fortinet customers is due to Fortinet devices validating the full chain of trust and then invalidating the chain when it sees that the CA IdenTrust DST Root CA X3 is expired, even though the cross-signed ISRG Root X1 root is valid for longer.We have removed the offending expired certificate from the certificate store, however, this still does not solve the problem due to the Authority Information Access - CA Issuers entry.The networking equipment firm concluded: “Fortinet is working on a longer-term solution to improve certificate validation and add additional intelligence to rebuild missing certificate chains in these cases going forward, and will include this in a future release.”Unforced errorMany of the issues that Fortinet and customers of other tech firms experience as a result of the Let’s Encrypt root certificate expiry were preventable.“A lot of the orgs that saw failures was because they depend on software (mainly OpenSSL) that was either old or missing an option being set to allow it to continue working,” Helme told The Daily Swig.“It certainly seems to be the culprit for the Google and AWS ones, probably the Microsoft issue too.”Helme has created a test site to help identify issues with clients.The Daily Swig asked Let’s Encrypt for an update on the situation but we’re yet to hear back.In earlier correspondence, a spokesperson for Let’s Encrypt asked us to reiterate that the organization had been trying to spread the word about the root expiration for more than two years.“Our first blog post on the topic was posted in April 2019,” the spokesperson said.In a pinned Tweet, published on September 30, the same day as the root cert expiry, Let’s Encrypt said: “Our cross-signed DST Root CA X3 expired today. If you are hitting an error, check out fixes in our community forum.

no,"Cryptocurrency funds removed from 6,000 Coinbase accounts due to flaw in SMS authentication",Victims are told they will be reimbursed,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has admitted that a fault in its implementation of SMS-based authentication led to the compromise of at least 6,000 users accounts.In a letter (PDF) to victims, the US-based exchange said that a third-party actor had gained access to Coinbase accounts and removed funds.The incident, which happened between March and May 20, 2021, was due to a vulnerability in its two-factor authentication protocol.Security woesCoinbase said that the malicious actors were able to carry out the attack as they had prior knowledge of email addresses, passwords, and phone numbers associated with victims’ accounts.The company said it is not able to “determine conclusively” how the actors obtained the information, but suggested: “This type of campaign typically involves phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques to trick a victim into unknowingly disclosing login credentials to a bad actor.”Coinbase added: “We have not found any evidence that these third parties obtained this information from Coinbase itself.”Read more of the latest security news about cryptocurrenciesUsually, two-factor authentication methods can stop a bad actor from accessing an account even if they have the credentials.However, a flaw in Coinbase’s SMS-based authentication meant that they were able to bypass this extra line of defense.Coinbase explained: “For customers who use SMS texts for two-factor authentication, the third party took advantage of a flaw in Coinbase’s SMS Account Recovery process in order to receive an SMS two-factor authentication token and gain access to your account.”Data breachThe company also warned that the third party could have had access to all information in the affected accounts, which could include the victim’s full name, email address, home address, date of birth, IP addresses for account activity, transaction history, account holdings, and balance.In the letter, Coinbase said it has “updated” its authentication protocols, but urged users to switch to using an authentication app or hardware security key.Customers were also told that they will be reimbursed for any lost funds.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Bitcoin.org hack nets giveaway scammers $17,000 overnight",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cryptocurrency-funds-removed-from-6-000-coinbase-accounts-due-to-flaw-in-sms-authentication,"['2FA', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Cybercrime', 'Finance', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Organizations', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Authentication', 'Phishing', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Passwords', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,‘Prolific’ ransomware operators arrested in Ukraine – Europol,Assets also frozen over ‘string of targeted attacks’ against US and European targets,"Two individuals have been arrested in Ukraine over ransomware attacks for which ransom demands were set as high as €70 million ($81 million), Europol has announced.The suspects are alleged to be members of an organized crime group “suspected of having committed a string of targeted attacks against very large industrial groups in Europe and North America from April 2020 onwards”, said the law enforcement agency in a press release published today (October 4).The arrests were made on September 28 during an operation that saw law enforcement search seven properties, resulting in the seizure of $375,000 in cash and two luxury vehicles worth around $250,000.Assets of $1.3 million in cryptocurrencies have also been frozen, according to Europol.‘Extortionate ransom demands’Europol described the arrestees as “prolific ransomware operators” who were known for making “extortionate ransom demands” that ranged between €5 million ($5.8 million) and €70 million ($81 million).The attackers deployed malware and stole then encrypted sensitive data, before offering a “decryption key in return for a ransom payment of several millions of euros, threatening to leak the stolen data on the dark web should their demands not be met”.Catch up on the latest cybercrime news and analysisUkrainian police were supported in the investigation by French law enforcement, the FBI, Interpol, and Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT).Europol said it helped the agencies established a joint strategy, provided analytical, malware, forensic, and crypto-tracing support, and established a virtual command post to facilitate coordination.The news comes against a background of increasingly frequent ransomware attacks, which have soared by 1,070% year on year according to a report published last week by enterprise security firm Fortinet.DON’T FORGET TO READ Malicious hackers are exploiting known vulnerabilities because organizations aren’t quick enough to patch – report",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/prolific-ransomware-operators-arrested-in-ukraine-europol,"['Ransomware', 'Cybercrime', 'Europe', 'Europol', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Legal', 'Enterprise', 'Malware', 'Network', 'Security', 'North', 'America', 'US', 'France', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Encryption', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Dark', 'Web']"
no,"Prototype pollution vulnerabilities rife among high-traffic websites, study finds","Technique is exploitable at scale because it’s so overlooked, speculate researchers","More than 1,000 popular websites and 18 widely used JavaScript libraries are vulnerable to prototype pollution, an obscure attack technique that targets the structure of JavaScript objects, according to security researchers.A study, led by researchers ‘s1r1us’ and ‘BlackFan’, documented vulnerabilities found in Apple.com, Jira Service Management, HubSpot Analytics, Segment Analytics, and the websites of several undisclosed companies, netting them a collective $40,000 in bug bounties.“Throughout our research period, we have reported this kind of vulnerability to a lot of renowned companies,” the research duo told The Daily Swig.In total they reported around 80 bugs to vulnerability disclosure programs.JavaScript trade-offJavaScript, the language of the front-end web, allows developers to dynamically change the properties and functions of objects, the basic construct of a program.But this flexibility comes with a trade-off: if the programmers are not careful, malicious actors can use security holes in their application to inject malicious code into their objects’ prototypes.BACKGROUND Prototype pollution: The dangerous and underrated vulnerability impacting JavaScript applicationsTools and techniques for finding prototype pollutionKey attack vectors for prototype pollution include user input fields and query parameters passed on to websites. If a site’s JavaScript code iterates through query parameters without sanitizing them, then it might end up running commands that change the object prototype.The researchers wrote a bot that “runs on a huge subdomains database” and looks for JavaScript code patterns that are vulnerable to prototype pollution. They also developed a browser extension called PPScan that provides similar functionality while running in the background.And they found ways to zero in on the line of code where the prototype pollution vulnerability kicked into action. For this, they used a combination of browser developer functionalities and search patterns.Finally, they used tools to find ‘script gadgets’: legitimate fragments of JavaScript code that can be exploited through prototype pollution to stage cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.Neglected research areaWhile the research duo believe the vulnerabilities were not necessarily the result of bad coding practices, they are worried that prototype pollution is being neglected.Read more of the latest JavaScript security news“When we look at the pitfalls of JavaScript or secure coding practices for JavaScript, we don’t find many references about prototype pollution and we think that’s the reason it’s exploitable at this scale,” the researchers said.“We hope our blog gives more light to this attack surface and helps people mitigate these issues at scale with the provided information.”Team efforts1r1us and BlackFan enlisted the support of 13 other researchers with expertise in the field who helped in developing the right tools for the task. With prototype pollution defense still an underdeveloped space, this proved crucial.“Having a group of skilled people can be helpful when conducting large-scale research,” they explained. “Every one of the researchers brought something new to the research. No wonder we are doing this research for over a year.“Having people around you still poking at things without being demotivated can be very encouraging.

no,Malicious hackers are exploiting known vulnerabilities because organizations aren’t quick enough to patch – report,Cybercriminals are scanning Shodan for easy marks,"Organizations are urged to be more proactive when it comes to protecting against vulnerabilities, after a report found that malicious attackers routinely exploit unpatched systems.The 2021 Trustwave SpiderLabs Telemetry Report, released this week, found that a huge number of companies are falling foul to cyber-attacks despite having ready access to suitable fixes.This is happening because malicious actors are using Shodan to scan for networks that are exposed to known vulnerabilities and exploit them before the victim can apply the patch.ResearchTrustwave SpiderLabs researchers reported that there was a record-breaking number (around 18,352) of new security vulnerabilities in the year 2020, a 6% increase from 2019 and a “staggering” 184.66% increase from 2016.And while some of these flaws were deemed to be high severity, more than 50% of the servers were vulnerable to exploitation weeks and even months after a security update was released.Researchers said this was because either the servers were not patched in a timely manner or had an unsupported (and therefore unpatchable) version of the software running.High-profile targetsThe report assessed a number of high-profile vulnerabilities that appeared in 2021 including the Apache Tomcat HTTP request smuggling vulnerability (CVE-2021-33037), multiple vulnerabilities in VMware vCenter (CVE-2021-21986 and CVE-2021-21985), and multiple vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server aka ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-26857, and CVE-2021-270650).The team used Shodan to determine how many networks were still left open to these security issues, despite patches being widely available.The results were varied – while just 5.9% of networks were still vulnerable to ProxyLogon, 49% were open to exploit by the issues in VMware vCenter, and a staggering 54% were vulnerable to the Apache Tomcat HTTP request smuggling bug.The full report contains more details of other vulnerabilities studied.READ MORE VMware warning: Multiple vulnerabilities in vCenter Server could allow remote network accessThe report reads: “Attackers are leveraging telemetry from Shodan to gather information about vulnerable instances, sometimes faster than ethical hackers.“Thus, it is imperative that organizations proactively identify vulnerabilities and patch them.“The Shodan telemetry report reviewed some of 2021’s high-profile vulnerabilities on targets accessible on the Internet. As mentioned, our team observed that for the vulnerabilities reviewed, at least 3 of them saw over 50% of instances accessible over the Internet were vulnerable.“Indeed, this was the case weeks and even months after patch release. Another key observation saw high numbers of end-of-life and end of general support software on the Internet.“Unsupported versions of software do not receive security patches, greatly increasing the risk of exploitation.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE OWASP toasts 20th anniversary with revised Top 10 for 2021",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/malicious-hackers-are-exploiting-known-vulnerabilities-because-organizations-arent-quick-enough-to-patch-report,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Network', 'Security', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps']"
no,US retailer Neiman Marcus notifies 4.6 million customers of data breach,Department store chain forces password reset after discovering 2020 incident last month,"UPDATED US retail giant Neiman Marcus Group is alerting 4.6 million customers to a data breach that involves payment card and virtual gift card information.The company, which runs 37 luxury department stores in 17 states, said an unauthorized party obtained information associated with customers’ online accounts in May 2020.It said it discovered in the incident in September, some 17 months later.Catch up with the latest cybersecurity news from the USStolen data “may have included names and contact information; payment card numbers and expiration dates (without CVV numbers); Neiman Marcus virtual gift card numbers (without PINs); and usernames, passwords, and security questions and answers associated with Neiman Marcus online accounts”, said the company in a press release issued yesterday (September 30).Neiman Marcus said 3.1 million payment and virtual gift cards were impacted, but more than 85% of these were “expired or invalid”.It added that “no active Neiman Marcus-branded credit cards were impacted”, and that no evidence had yet surfaced that customers of Neiman Marcus subsidiaries Bergdorf Goodman and Horchow were affected.Neiman Marcus said it has notified law enforcement of the incident, while an “investigation is ongoing and the company is working quickly to determine the nature and scope of the matter”.Password resetUpon learning of the incident, Neiman Marcus said it enforced “an online account password reset for affected customers who had not changed their password since May 2020”.A dedicated call center and webpage have been set up to help customers protect themselves against fraud and identity theft.“At Neiman Marcus Group, customers are our top priority,” said Geoffroy van Raemdonck, the company’s CEO.“We are working hard to support our customers and answer questions about their online accounts. We will continue to take actions to enhance our system security and safeguard information.”Martin Jartelius, CSO of cybersecurity firm Outpost24, commented: “According to the information, not only have credit card numbers leaked which means that the company has been storing credit card numbers in a format that is readable, but also that 85% of those would have expired meaning that the organization had little to no justification to keep processing and storing those cards.“While the breach notification is good, the lack of hygiene in this case is considerable.”However, in response, a spokesperson for Neiman Marcus Group told The Daily Swig that “the affected credit cards were not stored in ‘readable form’ – they were encrypted using encryption algorithms AES128 and AES256”.This article was updated on October 4 with comment from Neiman Marcus Group.RELATED Data breach at US restaurant and gambling chain Dotty’s may have leaked sensitive customer information",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/us-retailer-neiman-marcus-notifies-4-6-million-customers-of-data-breach,"['US', 'Retail', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Hacking', 'News', 'E-Commerce', 'Cyber-attacks', 'North', 'America', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Compliance', 'Legal', 'Fraud', 'Privacy', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Bug Bounty Radar // The latest bug bounty programs for October 2021,New web targets for the discerning hacker,"Apple’s bug bounty program came in for some pretty damning criticism this month, after the Washington Post interviewed two dozen security researchers about their experiences probing its applications for vulnerabilities.They claimed Apple was slower in paying up than most organizations, poor at communication, and slow to fix bugs once they’d been reported.The most valuable tech company in the world also paid out a lot less overall than other tech giants, they said. Luta Security CEO Katie Moussouris described Apple’s crowdsourced security offering as “a bug bounty program where the house always wins”.VMware has also come under fire in recent weeks, with accusations made that it leaked an exploit for a critical vulnerability in Atlassian’s Confluence that was identical to one previously submitted by the accuser. The company said it had investigated the claims and found no evidence to support them.It was a better month for OWASP, which celebrated its 20th anniversary by announcing the top 10 web security vulnerabilities for 2021. It cited broken access control as the biggest threat, followed by cryptographic failures, injection, and insecure design.In browser security news, Opera’s product security manager Cezary Cerekwicki highlighted the benefits of its private and public bug bounty programs when quizzed by The Daily Swig about its privacy and security features.We spoke to Cerekwicki as part of a rundown of leading web browsers’ privacy and security features.

no,Latest web hacking tools – Q4 2021,We take a look at the latest additions to security researchers’ armoury,"As this year’s hybrid version of Black Hat and DEF CON fades from memory and the nights close in for those in the northern hemisphere, the time has come to restock the security tools arsenal.Given the heightened threat environment, it’s fortunate that security researchers have been hard at work forging new utilities – many of which are free and open source.Here’s our roundup of the latest hacking tools available to pen testers, security teams, and others available at the start of the fourth quarter of 2021.TruffleHog browser extension finds secret keys in JavaScript codeA recently released Chrome browser extension offers a mechanism to root out stray credentials and keys that have inadvertently become incorporated in JavaScript code.The TruffleHog browser add-on offers a means to find API Keys for software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud providers that have stray into published code.Permissive cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) security settings in Amazon AWS and other environments are a major root cause for credential leakage according to Truffle Security, the developers of the tool.TruffleHog is currently undergoing a security audit by Google for the Chrome store so, for now, it can only be side-loaded.Read more about the TruffleHog credential hunting toolRaider – a tool to test authentication in web applicationsRaider offers a powerful utility geared towards testing authentication mechanisms in web applications.Developers DigeeX claim the framework plugs the gaps left by existing vulnerability scanning tools.The Python-based Raider tool keeps track of the client’s state while offering an interface to handle elements important to the authentication process such as cookies, headers, and CSRF tokens.Read more about the Raider authentication testing toolHunting ransomware and bot infections in MongoDB installsInternet-facing MongoDB instances can be scanned for ransomware or the Meow malware using the Enfilade tool.The utility, developed by security researcher Aditya K Sood, also offers a more comprehensive but intrusive scan that checks databases for signs of malware infection.Sood developed the tool with Rohit Bansal, principal security researcher at SecNiche Security Labs. Other functions built into Enfilade include the ability to check access permission for potentially susceptibility to remote code execution attacks and user enumeration.The availability of Enfilade comes against the backdrop of widespread exploitation of MongoDB databases by criminals, a growing concern for organizations that rely on the document-oriented NoSQL database platform for application development.Read more about the Enfilade MongoDB database toolGrep the whole web with WARCannonScanning the whole web for systems vulnerable to a particular web vulnerability became a more viable proposition with the release of the WARCannon tool at Black Hat USA.WARCannon offers a platform to non-invasively test regex patterns across the entire internet and match these with corresponding vulnerability indicators. As such, the utility offers a means to scour for flaws in web applications, frameworks, and open source components.The process involves handling big data on an epic scale but WARCannon’s architecture and approach makes what would normally be a hugely expensive project reduced to an affordable cost.The utility was developed by cloud security expert Brad Woodward who said it was a component of what he described as a “sort of Apache Project for hackers”.Read more about the WARCannon scanning utilityCredential leak detection tool ScrapesyAnother Black Hat release witnessed the arrival of an open source tool designed to help organizations identify credential leaks.Scrapesy is designed to scour both the clear web and dark web on the hunt for leaked credentials.The utility, developed by Standard Industries and released as open source software, is designed to speed up the process of incident response following data leak incidents.Read more about the Scrapesy credential leak detection toolHopper – machine learning applied to detect lateral movementHarnessing machine learning to detect lateral movement attacks is just one possibility offered by the Hopper tool.Lateral movement is the process by which attackers use phishing or exploit various vulnerabilities to gain an entry point in targeted organizations, then typically engage in a series of stepping stone attacks in order to get at the administrator-level user accounts, databases, and resources they covet.Hopper, a tool developed by researchers at Dropbox, UC Berkeley, looks out for the tell-tale signs of this form of malicious activity.During lateral movement attacks, miscreants typically seek to access a server that their original victim would not have access to, and to do so, they will need to hack privileged accounts such as sysadmins.By filtering and examining login paths based on these two criteria, Hooper can determine which activities merit investigation.Read more about the Hopper lateral movement detection utilityUSBsamurai leaves even air-gapped networks open to attackA malicious USB cable that leaves air-gapped networks open to attack allows pen testers to play as Ronin.USBsamurai – developed by security researcher Luca Bongiorni and unveiled during Black Hat – is made up from a cable, unifying dongle, and a USB radio transceiver features and open source design and costs just $15.“USBsamurai uses a proprietary wireless protocol that is not detected by any WiFi intrusion detection system,” according to Bongiorni who said the technology was particularly well suited to pen testing and security awareness exercises in industrial environments.Read more about the USBsamurai air gap attack toolMore hacking tools and related news this quarterHackerOne published a collection of tools and useful scripts that make use of the HackerOne API was released on GitHub in September. Bug bounty hunters are being encouraged to incorporate their own tools and add to the growing resource.A Bash-based script, Reconky, that automate the task of recon and information gathering, was also released on GitHub. The utility allows bug bounty hunters and the like to sort the wheat from the chaff and narrow down their hunt for potential targets that seem ripe for exploitation.August marked the green light for GoKart, a security scanner for apps developed in the Go programming language.

no,RCE vulnerabilities in open source software Cachet could put users at risk,Patches released for status page management system flaws,"Multiple security vulnerabilities in open source status page system Cachet could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and steal sensitive data, researchers have warned.Cachet is a project that allows users to do such tasks as listing service components, reporting incidents, and customizing the look of their status page, among other features.However three vulnerabilities in the software, discovered by researchers from SonarSource, could put its users at risk of remote takeover.Troublesome trioThe first bug (CVE-2021-39172) is a newline injection that is triggered when users update an instance’s configuration, such as the email settings.It allows attackers to inject new directives and to alter the behavior of core features, ultimately leading to the execution of arbitrary code.A second vulnerability (CVE-2021-39174) is also related to this feature, and allows attackers to exfiltrate secrets that are stored in the configuration file – for example, database passwords and framework keys.Finally, the last bug (CVE-2021-39173) is “much simpler” according to researchers, and allows an attacker to change the setup process even if the target instance is already fully configured.“That way, attackers can trick the Cachet instance into using an arbitrary database under their control, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution,” the researchers wrote.Read more of the latest news about open source softwareThe one caveat to the success of the vulnerabilities is this – the attacker must already have access to a user account with basic privileges.This, however, is easy to obtain, argues SonarSource, either by using credentials stuffing, “thanks to the considerable amount of accounts leaked every year”, a compromised or malicious user, the presence of a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the same perimeter, or by exploiting a pre-authenticated SQL injection (CVE-2021-39165) in Cachet which was fixed in January 2021.SonarSource researcher Thomas Chauchefoin told The Daily Swig: “Once the prerequisites are met, e.g by exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-39165 or getting access to a user account with any level of privileges, our findings are very straightforward to exploit.“They only require one request, and this can be easily automated.”Cachet, awayThe vulnerabilities have since been patched, though Chauchefoin told The Daily Swig that the disclosure process was not smooth sailing.Chauchefoin said that the team tried to contact the maintainers during a 90-day disclosure period, without success. “The upstream project appears to be abandoned,” he said.“Rather than immediately disclosing the details to the public, we reached out to the most active community fork (maintained by the UK company FiveAI) and suggested patches.“They merged it and quickly published a new release.”Patches for the vulnerabilities are available in release 2.5.1 of the FiveAI fork, while more technical details can be found on the SonarSource blog.DON’T MISS What does the future hold for browser security?

no,Navistar confirms data breach involved employee healthcare information,US truck manufacturer breaks bad news to employees and retired workers,"UPDATED An investigation at US truck maker Navistar has revealed that a data breach on its systems exposed employee healthcare information.Navistar hired external cybersecurity experts and began an investigation after learning of a security incident on May 20. By the end of May, the firm had confirmed that an “unauthorized third party had accessed and taken certain data from Navistar’s IT systems”.On June 7, Navistar filed 8-K papers with the US Security and Exchange Commission, warning investors about the incident. The notification generated press coverage about the incident from Reuters and other outlets, as investigators continued to access the scope and impact of the incident.By August 20, Navistar’s team had confirmed that attackers had “accessed and taken” the personal information of participants to its healthcare and life insurance plans.The potentially compromised data included the full names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers of an unspecified number of Navistar employees past and present, according to an updated statement by Navistar on the breach.Catch up on the latest data breach newsNavistar began notifying affected individuals, who are each being offered two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection, in late September. Those affected are advised to be on the lookout for incidents of fraud and identity theft.Compromised personal data is commonly used and traded by cybercriminals because it offers a means to run more convincing phishing scams that would seek still more information, or to apply for fraudulent lines of credit under false names.Navistar employs 13,00 people worldwide. The Daily Swig has asked the firm how many people have been warned that their data had been exposed.We also asked for comment on whether or not the breach had been notified to law enforcement and, if so, what progress had been made on that front.No word back as yet but we'll update this story as and when more information comes to hand.Information disclosed to US regulators reveals that 49,000 records were exposed.RELATED South Africans caught up in security incident after debt recovery firm suffers ‘significant data breach’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/navistar-confirms-data-breach-involved-employee-healthcare-information,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Automotive', 'US', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Healthcare', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'North', 'America', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Compliance', 'Organizations']"
no,What does the future hold for browser security? Check out the latest features destined for mobile and desktop,A rundown of leading web browsers’ privacy and security features – both in place and in the pipeline,"Taking responsibility for our personal privacy and security is more important than ever, and browser developers continually support these efforts with new and improved privacy and security features.However, not all web browsers are created equal, and in many cases a balance needs to be maintained between privacy and security on the one hand, and convenience on the other.But given browsers are the gateway to the internet, security and privacy features – from warning users of expired certificates to blocking trackers and blocklisting malicious websites – should be a top priority for today’s developers.Catch up on the latest browser security newsAccording to Statcounter, Google Chrome remains the most popular browser with an estimated two-thirds global market share (65%), followed by Apple Safari (18%), Microsoft Edge (3%), Firefox (3%), Samsung Internet (3%), and Opera (2%). Other browsers have collectively snagged 6% of the overall market share.While familiarity with a particular brand may influence our choice of browser, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the most popular varieties offer the best security today.So, how do the leading browser developers compare in terms of current and in-the-pipeline features designed to combat modern-day threats to our security and privacy?Chrome is by far the world’s most popular web browserGoogle ChromeWhen it comes to Chromium-based browsers, developers aim to stick to four core principles: speed, security, stability, and simplicity.As the overwhelming market leader, Google Chrome bears a heavy responsibility in protecting its userbase.RELATED Google Chrome to incorporate new secure payment featureOver the past year, the tech giant has made a number of improvements, including implementing stricter privacy rules for extensions, warning users when their credentials have been compromised and found online, and the launch of enhanced Safe Browsing to mitigate phishing attacks.Google has also worked on Site Isolation for Android, image-based phishing classification system, and Chrome actions for completing tasks such as deleting passwords and performing safety checks.An upcoming feature slated for Chrome 94, meanwhile, is HTTPS-First Mode, which will attempt to upgrade connections from HTTP to HTTPS and warn users before loading sites that don’t support the upgrade.Apple SafariThe Safari browser only works within Apple’s ecosystem, and iOS and macOS are considered relatively secure.There are features that block cookies and cross-site tracking, enable or disable JavaScript, and implement Google’s Safe Browsing to warn users when they are likely visiting a malicious or fraudulent website.Apple has also implemented a new anti-tracking feature that requires user consent before third-party advertisers can make use of Apple’s Identifier for Advertiser (IDFA).According to Verizon Media’s Flurry Analytics, over 80% of iOS users have, so far, denied tracking requests.The Edge browser is now built on ChromiumMicrosoft Edge, Internet ExplorerMicrosoft Edge, released in 2020, includes a number of interesting security controls including Kids Mode for minors, a dedicated tracking prevention module, private browsing, a password monitor and generator, and Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, an optional scanner for malware and phishing-based web threats.The Redmond giant is testing new features and improvements in both the Microsoft Edge Developer and Canary builds. In addition, Microsoft is investing in the open source Chromium engine project to boost the platform for applications including touch and ARM64.Despite the new Microsoft Edge, based on Chromium and released in January last year, there are still some Windows users and enterprises that choose to rely on 1995’s Internet Explorer while browsing.Microsoft is trying to encourage a shift to its more modern – and secure – successor, especially given the browser includes an Internet Explorer ‘mode’ which is compatible with many legacy websites and applications. The IE 11 desktop application will be retired on June 15, 2022.“Microsoft puts customers in control of their privacy and security with easy-to-use tools and clear choices,” a Microsoft spokesperson told The Daily Swig. “We recommend customers remain compliant with the latest security and privacy updates on their devices, apps, and services.”Mozilla FirefoxStyled as a privacy-first browser, Mozilla Firefox places a big emphasis on protecting its users from tracking and privacy leaks.The browser’s development team has improved the software by implementing DNS-over-HTTPS for some demographics as default, which leans upon the Trusted Recursive Resolver project for transparent DNS services, as well as increasing the availability of Mozilla VPN.Over the past year, Firefox has honed in on third-party cookies and trackers with Enhanced Tracking Protection, with elements including Supercookie isolation and SmartBlock, as well as total cookie protection and HTTPS-First by default in private browsing mode.RECOMMENDED Mission accomplished: Security plugin HTTPS Everywhere to be deprecated in 2022The company is also getting ready to roll out Fission, a new site isolation feature for sandboxing web pages and frames.A Mozilla spokesperson told The Daily Swig that Fission will address specific types of vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown, making Firefox the only “non-Chromium browser to offer such protection to users”.“At Mozilla, we think people that use the internet can have it all with Firefox: they can have the best experience of the web without compromising on privacy, performance, or convenience,” the non-profit added.SamsungSamsung’s browser claims a modest market share, but the handset manufacturer is making inroads into the mobile browser market.One notable feature is Secret Mode, which wipes cookies and browsing history upon exit. In addition, Samsung offers an always-on anti-tracking mode and a running tally of how many times users are tracked – and by whom on a weekly basis.Pop-ups and backward redirections can also be blocked, and users are warned when they are visiting malicious websites.The browser’s Secret Mode can also be locked with either a password or biometric marker.Opera browser comes bundled with several privacy and security featuresOperaAccording to Cezary Cerekwicki, Opera's product security manager, Opera is the “people’s personal browser of choice”.This browser comes with a VPN, ad and tracker blocker technology, scanning for malicious and fraudulent websites, phishing protection, and an interesting means for preserving a computer’s resources: cryptocurrency mining protection.Cerekwicki told The Daily Swig that Opera, which has the competitive disadvantage of not coming pre-installed on devices, has 380 million active monthly users.“We’re also actively working with the bug bounty community to discover and resolve any security and privacy issues,” Cerekwicki commented.“We encourage dedicated bug bounty hunters to participate in our private and public programs in order to help the community at large, and maybe even earn some money in the process.”There are further security improvements in the pipeline, which will be revealed later in the year.Tor BrowserTor Browser is a very specific form of privacy-preserving web browser. Developed and maintained by the Tor Project, the browser is based on Firefox but leverages onion routing – a decentralized system that relies on relays and proxies to mask a user’s IP.The project also recommends ways to ensure as much anonymity as possible, such as restricting the use of plugins, avoiding torrenting, and only downloading files through OnionShare.INSIGHT Tor security: Everything you need to know about the anonymity networkAlas, speed is an unavoidable trade-off for protecting anonymity and privacy by way of proxies and routing.While Tor Browser is used to access .onion addresses online, it is considered invaluable in a more substantial way: as a means to fight censorship and dodge surveillance.BraveThe Chromium-based Brave browser blocks trackers by default. Compatible across multiple platforms, the browser now accounts for 36.2 million monthly active users and 12.5 million daily active users.Brave strips ads and ad trackers, while also curating new content from different sources. Consenting users can ‘support’ content creators by opting-into the Brave ads scheme, in which marketers can push ads and users earn Brave tokens in return.DuckDuckGoDuckDuckGo is primarily a privacy-preserving search engine, but is also available as Android and iOS browser apps that account for over 50 million downloads over the past 12 months.Planned improvements include App Tracking Protection for Android, and tests have also begun around fingerprint protection and click-to-load Facebook widget restrictions, which DuckDuckGo told us may prevent Facebook tracking content to load unless it is essential.INTERVIEW DuckDuckGo: ‘We deserve simple tools that empower privacy, without trade-offs’This year, a DuckDuckGo desktop app is set to be released to serve as a web browser.“At a high level, we'd encourage folks to understand that it’s never too late to start protecting your privacy and it doesn't have to mean changing everything you do or the services you use,” Allison Goodman, DuckDuckGo senior communications manager, told The Daily Swig.RECOMMENDED New side-channel attack can bypass Chrome’s protections against Spectre-style exploits",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/what-does-the-future-hold-for-browser-security-check-out-the-latest-features-destined-for-mobile-and-desktop,"['Browsers', 'Privacy', 'Analysis', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Apple', 'Chrome', 'Tor', 'Edge', 'firefox', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Mozilla', 'Safari', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Phishing', 'Censorship', 'Surveillance', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Mobile', 'Passwords', 'Industry', 'News', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Android', 'JavaScript', 'Side-channel', 'Biometrics', 'CSRF', 'VPN', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'VDP', 'Cryptojacking', 'XS-Leak', 'SSRF', 'XSS', 'RCE', 'MitM', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise']"
no,WordPress security: CookieYes GDPR plugin patches XSS bug following large-scale PHP audit,Researchers claim five plugins use extract() function insecurely – but some maintainers disagree,"UPDATED A hugely popular GDPR compliance plugin for WordPress contained an authenticated, persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability related to the insecure use of PHP’s extract() function, according to security researchers.As a result, the CookieYes GDPR Cookie Consent & Compliance Notice plugin, which has more than one million active installations, no longer uses the extract() function in the shortcodes module, as per a software update released today (September 29).In a blog post published on September 24, Plugin Vulnerabilities, a WordPress security service, said it tested the 100 most popular plugins in the WordPress Plugin Directory for similar issues and identified five in total that used the extract() function insecurely.extract() guidanceThe extract() function imports variables into the local symbol table from an array, converting array keys into variable names, and array values into variable values.The researchers claim the five plugins’ use “the function on user input in the form of shortcode attributes”, thereby contravening PHP documentation, which warns developers not to “use extract() on untrusted data, like user input (e.g. $_GET, $_FILES)”, as well as WordPress coding standards, which advise against using the function at all.They first started investigating extract() after the function surfaced in a July blog post in which a Jetpack security researcher analyzed a local file inclusion vulnerability in WooCommerce Currency Switcher.Plugin security auditIn a subsequent blog post, published on September 16, Plugin Vulnerabilities then claimed that Jetpack itself, the most popular WordPress security plugin with more than five million installs, also used extract() insecurely.Steve Seear, Jetpack product engineering lead, told The Daily Swig: “We haven’t been able to identify any exploitable issues relating to the use of the extract() function in the Jetpack plugin. However, we have reevaluated the use of extract() and have decided to remove all calls to that function in the next release of Jetpack.”INTERVIEW Patchstack’s Oliver Sild on securing WordPress, one plugin vulnerability at a timeThe researchers have since disclosed that the issue was also present in the Advanced Custom Fields plugin, which has more than two million installs, and WordPress slider plugin MetaSlider, which is used by 700,000 websites.The maintainers of Advanced Custom Fields told The Daily Swig: “We’ve confirmed our use of extract is limited to places where user input cannot cause any security issues. That said, we are still planning to remove the few instances of extract left in ACF’s codebase in an upcoming release.”The maintainers of MetaSlider have yet to reply to our queries, but we will update this article if and when they respond.OceanWP refutes claimsThe XSS flaw in CookieYes GDPR relates to a lack of validation or sanitization on user input, said Plugin Vulnerabilities.In yet another blog post, published on Monday (September 28), Plugin Vulnerabilities claimed to have found effectively the same bug in Ocean Extra, a companion to the OceanWP theme with more than 700,000 installs.However, a developer and customer support manager for OceanWP has refuted claims Ocean Extra misuses extract().Catch up on the latest WordPress security news“The extract method has been used in accordance with its purpose – to assign each array key a variable role, to put it in layman’s terms,” he told The Daily Swig.He also points out that Ocean Extra has not been red-flagged by iThemes’ weekly rundown of WordPress vulnerabilities because “they involve a human factor before making any reports”, and that OceanWP’s use of get_trail() can reveal whether Plugin Vulnerabilities’ claims have any merit.Proof of conceptPlugin Vulnerabilities responded that they also manually check their automated findings and pointed to a proof-of-concept in the blog post. “We just double checked the proof of concept and confirmed again that it works,” they added.However, the OceanWP developer claims the proof of concept only shows that “any website owner or admin can edit any theme/plugin file, or even the WordPress files, and insert any codes they want”. Nevertheless, he said the extract() function had now been removed from all shortcodes in the latest release to eliminate “the opportunity for anyone to further misuse and misrepresent the info and the codes by spreading false info”.The OceanWP developer said they had not been contacted directed by Plugin Vulnerabilities over the issue.Plugin Vulnerabilities’ latest blog post includes a screenshot of a post they submitted to the WordPress Support Forum notifying Ocean Extra maintainers of the supposed vulnerability post-disclosure.However, the Ocean Extra developer responded, saying:“The post from the screenshot does not exist, which means it was not approved by the moderators and everyone should ask themselves why. We don't have the option to ban/remove/approve anyone's post.”Researchers from Plugin Vulnerabilities have long maintained a stance of disclosing vulnerabilities in plugins listed in the WordPress Plugin Directory before alerting developers (via the WordPress Support Forum) in “protest” at forum moderators’ “inappropriate behavior”.This article was updated on September 29 with a response from the Jetpack security team, and additional comments from OceanWP, then on September 30 with comments from Plugin Vulnerabilities, and October 12 with further comments from OceanWP.RELATED WordPress security: Information leak flaw addressed in Ninja Forms",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/wordpress-security-cookieyes-gdpr-plugin-patches-xss-bug-following-large-scale-php-audit,"['WordPress', 'PHP', 'Research', 'XSS', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'GDPR', 'Compliance', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'E-Commerce']"
no,Mission accomplished: Security plugin HTTPS Everywhere to be deprecated in 2022,"Browser extension can be retired as push to encrypt the web is almost complete, says EFF","UPDATED The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is planning to retire the HTTPS Everywhere browser extension because, 10 years on from the release of the plugin, its security mission has largely been accomplished.Growing HTTPS adoption and native browser support to enforce HTTPS-only connections are making the plugin redundant.HTTPS Everywhere – an open source browser extension for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, Tor and Firefox for Android or Brave for Mobile – automatically set up a more secure HTTPS connection instead of a HTTP link where sites supported the technology. Users could also block or unblock HTTP-only sites.‘S’ for securityForcing usage of HTTPS automatically where possible is nowhere near as necessary as it once was, hence the decision to phase out and retire the HTTPS Everywhere extension by the end of 2022.Users should enable HTTPS-only mode in their browsers, as explained in a blog post by the EFF yesterday (September 27).Read more of the latest browser security news“Thanks to efforts of parties like EFF, Let’s Encrypt and browser vendors, most web traffic is over a secured channel nowadays,” said infosec blogger John Opdenakker in a post typical of the reaction of many in the community on Twitter.Certificate authority Let’s Encrypt added in the “10 years since they launched it, the internet actually has HTTPS (almost) everywhere. What an exciting milestone!”Romanian software developer Alex Nedelcu said “Interestingly there are still people thinking HTTPS isn’t needed for all websites, but they are wrong. TLS/SSL connections aren’t useful just for protecting what user sends, but also for signing what the server sends.”Great progress has been made but it may perhaps be a little premature to mark the project of moving to a fully-encrypted web as ""job done"" just yet.A list - compiled and regularly updated by security researchers Scott Helme and Troy Hunt - shows all of the sites that still don’t have an automatic redirect to https and load over http.

no,Social media scam: Twitter bots are tricking users into making PayPal and Venmo payments into fraudsters’ accounts,Social engineering scammers are using cloned social media accounts to carry out deceit,"Fraudsters are using Twitter bots to trick unsuspecting tweeters into making PayPal and Venmo payments to accounts under their control.The bots appear to be activated when a legitimate user asks another for their payment information, presumably discovering these tweets via a search for keywords such as ‘PayPal’, ‘Venmo’, or other services.They masquerade as the other user by scraping their profile picture and adopting a similar username, before supplying them with false payment information in the hopes the original tweeter will pay into this account.By way of example, Twitter user ‘Skye’ (@stimmyskye) posted a screenshot online detailing how they were targeted by a bot.A screenshot of the Twitter bot in actionSkye noted that the bot blocks the account that it is mimicking, and in their case copied the whole profile and added an underscore to the end of the name.“Because you’re blocked, you’ll see that there’s one reply to that question but the reply tweet won’t show up,” Skye wrote.“If you see a ghost reply to a comment like that, it’s almost always a scam bot. They delete as fast as they clone your account. You won’t even know it happened.”Skye also warned: “They will delete the reply tweet, but the account itself will usually not be deleted, just change the username. So the accounts are usually not brand new, they even have followers. You need to check closely.”Big issueVenmo and other online payment services have become a popular means for users to pay for things such as charity donations or for goods such as the resale of event tickets.This latest scam, however, is a stark warning against making or disclosing any sort of transaction on a public forum.Skye’s tweets have already garnered thousands of retweets and likes. They also claimed that this issue is “months, if not years old”.Read more of the latest security news about social media networksThe Daily Swig has reached out to Twitter to confirm whether it is aware of these payment-requesting bots and what steps it intends to take to protect users.In the meantime, Skye has advised: “A failsafe option is to ask for payment info via DM only, or request they be sent to you via DM.“With DMs, either you’ve got them closed so the scam bot can’t send you any, or you’ve got them open and it’ll show as a DM request rather than just appear in your inbox.”They added: “It would be extremely easy to detect and prevent this behavior, let’s hope that @TwitterSupport finally does something about it… I would like for this warning to become obsolete.”Pay close attentionAndy Patel, researcher with F-Secure’s Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence, told The Daily Swig that he hasn’t seen this kind of bot during his own research, but reiterated Skye’s advice for users.Patel said: “Given that the mechanism is automated, I’m willing to bet that the attack is fairly successful.""A Twitter user would need to pay close attention to what is going on in order to notice what’s happened.”He added: “Don’t publicly link to your PayPal (or similar) account – deal with payments via direct message instead.”The Daily Swig has reached out to Twitter and will update this article if and when we receive a response.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Better future?

no,Better future? Safari browser extension is preparing for Apple’s ‘post-privacy’ world,"‘Apple’s plans to violate your privacy have left a sour taste in our mouths’, says developers","Better was released in 2016 as a privacy extension for the Safari browser on Apple iOS and macOS. But it might soon have to find a new home.“Better protects you from trackers in Safari on iOS and macOS, where it is available as an app,” Aral Balkan, the developer of Better, told The Daily Swig.With some technical knowledge, it can be applied to other browsers as well.“You can also use the blocking rules on other platforms (e.g, GNOME Web and Firefox etc) by adding the rules to your browser (in WebKit content blocker format) or to a separate extension like uBlock Origin (in EasyList format),” Balkan said.?Thomas Reed, director of Mac and mobile at Malwarebytes, who looked at Better, told The Daily Swig: “The app privacy disclosure info on the App Store says that Better does not collect any data, which is great and what I would expect.“Ironically, not all ad and tracker blocking extensions for Safari can make the same claim, and I would only choose to use one that doesn’t collect data.”RELATED New iCloud Private Relay service leaks users’ true IP addresses, researcher claimsReed added, however, that all Safari extensions are limited in their capabilities due to Apple’s policy on how extensions can interact with web pages.“On the one hand, this is good, because it protects you against malicious browser extensions more than other browsers,” he said.“Chrome in particular has a big problem with malicious extensions. On the other hand, it really reduces the capabilities of what a Safari extension can do.”Future uncertainIn the five years since its release, Better has gathered a loyal user base – despite the fact that it is a paid app as opposed to other free ad blockers.But in the wake of Apple’s recent plans to scan content on users’ devices, Small Technology Foundation, the Ireland-based not-profit outfit that maintains Better, is unsure of the future of their project.“Our focus on Safari was because Apple’s platforms have historically been safe spaces in terms of protecting your privacy,” Balkan said.“With Apple’s announced (now delayed) plans to violate your privacy by implementing client-side scanning, that has changed. So, we are re-evaluating the future of Better.”Read more of the latest Apple security newsIn August, Apple declared plans for a feature on new versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS meant to fight child pornography and exploitation.The tech giant will scan images and videos on user devices and check them against a database managed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.The decision has caused outrage among digital rights activists, who are concerned about the precedence that this measure will set. In response to the public backlash, Apple declared in September that it will be delaying the feature.But privacy advocates like Balkan are not convinced. He wrote on his blog: “Whether or not Apple bows down to pressure on this and reverses course, it offers you precious insight into how they think. It’s their phone, not yours.“Tim Apple [Cook] is your daddy and as long as you live under his roof, you live under his rules. And he’s just made it clear he can enter your room whenever he likes and search your drawers.”What does this mean for Better? “We don’t know at this point,” he said. “Apple’s plans to violate your privacy on your own device by implementing client-side scanning have left a sour taste in our mouths.“Our goal in the future is to concentrate our efforts only on platforms that are free and open.

no,Google Chrome to incorporate new secure payment feature,New tech touted as faster and stronger than web-based authentication alternatives,"Google has begun bundling a new secure payment feature with the latest prototype version of its Chrome browser.The secure payment confirmation feature, incorporated into Chrome 95 beta, hooks into the Web Authentication API to offer another layer of web-based authentication.The feature adds a new ‘payment’ extension to that API, allowing organizations such as banks to optionally offer a PublicKeyCredential. This credential can be queried by merchants during payment transactions via the Payment Request API using the ‘secure-payment-confirmation’ payment method.Catch up with the latest authentication-based security news and analysisSecure payment confirmation enables FIDO-based authentication for web payments.Users enrol a payment instrument using on-device biometrics, creating a FIDO credential that can be held by a payment service provider, such as Stripe (a partner with Google in trials of the technology).

During trials, secure payment confirmation ""provided a higher conversion rate and faster authentication time"" thanthe latest version of 3-D Secure authentication flows, according to Google.Google’s new secure payment confirmation technology uses FIDO-based authenticationThe authentication approach, comparable but more advanced than WebAuthn, is touted as faster and more secure than web-based authentication alternatives.Support for the technology in Google Chrome comes against a backdrop of regulatory changes designed to enforce stronger authentication for online payments in many regions, including the European Union.Deprecating U2FChrome 95 beta, released last week, comes ahead of the newest version’s mainstream launch, due October 19.The release deprecates Chrome’s legacy U2F API for interacting with security keys.However, “U2F security keys themselves are not deprecated and will continue to work,” Google explains in its release notes. “Affected sites should migrate to the Web Authentication API”.Chrome 95 beta also removes support for FTP (File Transfer Protocol) URLs, a little-used legacy technology that has been superseded by more capable FTP clients.As browser support for legacy technologies such as FTP heads into the sunset, Chrome 95 also debuts support for access handles for the File System Access API.Google said the introduction of the technology is the first step in broader plans to “merge the origin private file system of the File System Access API with the Storage Foundation API to reduce the number of entry points for getting access to file-based storage in the browser”.RELATED Opera browser patches MyFlow remote code execution vulnerability",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-chrome-to-incorporate-new-secure-payment-feature,"['API', 'Authentication', 'E-Commerce', 'Browsers', 'Google', 'Chrome', 'Industry', 'News', 'Biometrics', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Europe', 'Retail', 'Finance']"
no,OWASP toasts 20th anniversary with revised Top 10 for 2021,Non-profit confirms latest iteration of web attack hit list during 24-hour live event,"OWASP celebrated its 20th anniversary last week with a 24-hour webinar that saw the organization officially launch the top 10 web security vulnerabilities for 2021.The online conference, which took place on September 24-25, saw speakers from across the globe present on topics including privacy, infosec industry trends, and diversity in the workplace.INSIGHT OWASP shakes up web app threat categories with release of draft Top 10During a session on Friday afternoon, Andrew van der Stock, executive director at OWASP, presented the revised top 10 to event attendees.As previously reported by The Daily Swig, this year’s top 10 contains important changes to how the non-profit categorizes today’s web app threats, which have not been refreshed since 2017.Injection downgradeAddressing these changes, van der Stock told the audience that while injection attacks were once thought to be the number one web security risk, this attack has been downgraded to number three.In its place is ‘broken access control’, which has moved up from the fifth position to the number-one threat to web app security.The ‘cryptographic failures’ category has shifted up one position to number two. This risk previously known as ‘sensitive data exposure’ but has been changed by OWASP after it determined the term described a “broad symptom rather than a root cause”.Read more of the latest industry newsOWASP wrote: “The renewed name focuses on failures related to cryptography as it has been implicitly before. This category often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.”Cross-site scripting (XSS) has been bundled into the now third-place ‘injection attacks’ category.The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in 2021:Broken access controlCryptographic failuresInjectionInsecure designSecurity misconfigurationVulnerable and outdated componentsIdentification and authentication failuresSoftware and data integrity failuresSecurity logging and monitoring failuresServer-side request forgeryMajor updateAside from the category shake-up, there have been major updates to how the OWASP Top 10 project is displayed to users.Firstly, the list will be available in a mobile-friendly version and a PDF poster will be released, which van der Stock told the conference will make it more accessible.“We want to make sure its consumable in the way it hasn’t been in the past,” he explained.The Top 10 logo has also been updated with a fresher, more modern design.Discussing the release, Ollie Whitehouse, chief technical officer at NCC Group, told The Daily Swig: “It’s good to see OWASP is evolving the Top 10. In a world where we continue to learn about threat and vulnerability against a backdrop of rampant innovation, this natural evolution is going to be a constant.“Some may raise an eyebrow at some of the OWASP descriptions. For example, the description of SSRF (number 10) – considering it was this class of issue that gave us the [Microsoft] Exchange vulnerabilities earlier in the year, one may argue that the industry is indicating incidence rates are not as low as OWASP believes they are.”RELATED Microsoft Exchange Server had ‘ProxyToken’ vulnerability that leaked incoming emailsWhitehouse added: “Another example is Software and Data Integrity Failures (number eight) – this is quite a large bucket covering everything from deserialization through to software updates and potentially CI/CD pipelines.“One might expect this to be one of the quicker growing buckets over the next year as a result.”Addressing the issuesElsewhere during the online conference, Philippe De Ryck delivered a talk that asked: is AppSec too hard?Speaking to delegates, De Ryck, founder of Pragmatic Web Security, discussed whether the ever-expanding checklist of best security practices is, in fact, making it harder for individuals to keep themselves safe online.“I would love to be in a world where I can just tell them [people], ‘Use this and this, and this and this and you’re done’,” he said. “We’re not there yet, but I’m really hoping we can get there in the future.”Delivering the closing remarks, the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Eva Galperin asked: who deserves cybersecurity?Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the foundation, argued that security should be available and accessible to all people regardless of income or position, and that there needs to be less of a focus on making tools for money.“Cybersecurity is often focused on protecting people and organizations with money,” she told conference attendees.“For the same reason why Jesse James robbed banks – it’s where the money is.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Google announces partnership to review security of open source software projects",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/owasp-toasts-20th-anniversary-with-revised-top-10-for-2021,"['Industry', 'News', 'Events', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Privacy', 'XSS', 'SSRF', 'Organizations', 'Cyber-attacks', 'DevOps', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cybercrime', 'Browsers', 'CSRF', 'RCE', 'Email', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'Research', 'VDP', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Encryption', 'Mobile']"
no,VMware vCenter deployments under attack as enterprises urged to update systems,Mass scanning detected after RCE exploits surface online,"Attackers are actively exploiting a critical vulnerability in VMware vCenter Server that exposes vulnerable enterprise networks to the risk of infiltration.The arbitrary file upload flaw (CVE-2021-22005) – one of a raft of vCenter vulnerabilities addressed by software updates released on September 21 – can be abused regardless of configuration settings, says VMware.BACKGROUND VMware security warning: Multiple vulnerabilities in vCenter Server could allow remote network accessThe situation was serious enough to prompt the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to warn on Friday (September 24) that “widespread exploitation” was likely after RCE exploits surfaced online.On the same day, threat intelligence firm Bad Packets reported that it had indeed detected “mass scanning activity” against its VMware honeypots. VMware updated its security advisory on the same day to acknowledge that in-the-wild exploitation had been detected.CISA has urged organizations with vulnerable installations to update their systems as soon as possible and apply a temporary workaround provided by VMware in the meantime.Aaron Portnoy, principal scientist at attack surface management specialists Randori, has set out detection methods and indicators of compromise to help defenders determine whether they’ve been infiltrated via CVE-2021-22005.Post-intrusion threatAs reported by The Daily Swig last week, VMware released patches for 19 CVEs in total, with high severity local privilege escalation (CVE-2021-21991), reverse proxy bypass (CVE-2021-22006), and unauthenticated API endpoint (CVE-2021-22011) vulnerabilities the most severe.These lower impact flaws – ranging from CVSS 4.3 to 8.8 – could be leveraged to damaging effect once attackers get inside networks, VMware has warned.RECOMMENDED Opera browser patches My Flow remote code execution vulnerability“Attackers often compromise a desktop and/or user account on the corporate network, and then patiently and quietly use that to break into other systems over long periods of time,” the Palo Alto-based company said in a blog post.“They steal confidential data, intellectual property, and at the end install ransomware and extort payments from their victims.”The critical flaw, which has a CVSS of 9.8, affects vCenter Server versions 6.7 and 7.0 and Cloud Foundation versions 3.x and 4.x. Other flaws also affect vCenter Server 6.5.Prime targetInfosec expert Kevin Beaumont praised VMware’s handling of the vulnerabilities last week, tweeting that “VMware do an incredible job nowadays of communicating high severity security vulnerabilities”.However, VMware’s popularity among enterprises, many of which can be slow to update their systems, nevertheless makes its server virtualization technologies compelling targets for attackers.Read more of the latest enterprise security newsIn June, for instance, The Daily Swig reported that around 4,000 vCenter Server instances were still vulnerable to a pair of critical security flaws in vSphere Client (HTML5) three weeks after their disclosure.And in February, it emerged that more than 6,000 vCenter installations were potentially at risk as attackers probed systems for the presence of another critical RCE vulnerability.The Daily Swig has invited VMware to comment further, and we will update the article should they do so.RECOMMENDED APT focus: ‘Noisy’ Russian hacking crews are among the world’s most sophisticated",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vmware-vcenter-deployments-under-attack-as-enterprises-urged-to-update-systems,"['Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Enterprise', 'RCE', 'Research', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'OpSec', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'API']"
Yes,Opera browser patches My Flow remote code execution vulnerability,A bug bounty hunter was able to pivot from XSS to full-blown RCE,"Opera has patched a severe cross-site scripting (XSS) to remote code execution (RCE) web browser flaw.The browser-maker runs a technical blog series on the most interesting vulnerabilities reported through its private bug bounty program.In a post dated September 24, Opera detailed the latest discovery of a bug bounty hunter with the handle ‘Renwa’, a member of the private disclosure scheme.READ MORE Opera security team discloses multiple flaws in open source web proxy, PrivoxyThe researcher chose to explore what he calls one of the “cooler” features of the Chromium-based browser, known as My Flow and described as an “encrypted space shared between Opera Touch and your Opera computer browser”.The technology allows users to exchange files, links, YouTube videos, photos and personal notes, and access them at any time from their connected mobile device or computer.Go with the FlowMy Flow can be used by scanning a QR code within the Touch mobile Opera browser. My Flow’s interface is loaded from web.flow.opera.com, a feature that contained an XSS issue in its drag-and-drop functionality that could be used to launch an alert box.The bug bounty hunter has published a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates the exploit.After examining the HTML page further, Renwa also found a hidden browser extension called Opera Touch Background.Read more of the latest browser security newsThe extension contained “higher privileges and access to native functions”, according to Renwa, and two of these functions, designed for use with My Flow, were of particular interest.These functions were “send file” – used to pull information on user-provided content and to upload it to My Flow – and “open file,” intended for use in opening images but able to open any file type. Together, they provided “an arbitrary file write and open” on a target machine.Renwa was then able to create proof-of-concept code, beginning with the XSS trigger, that resulted in an RCE for My Flow users.Browser bug bountyAfter reporting the bug to Opera, the issue was resolved in several days and a bug bounty of $8,000 was awarded.This is the second vulnerability submitted by Renwa to Opera’s program. Another flaw was discovered recently in Opera Pinboards, a storage and sharing feature for bookmarks, screenshots, and notes.Here, the XSS bug could be triggered to allow local file read, a vulnerability that earned the researcher $4,000.RECOMMENDED Developers fix multitude of vulnerabilities in Apache HTTP Server",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/opera-browser-patches-my-flow-remote-code-execution-vulnerability,"['Browsers', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'RCE', 'XSS', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Privacy', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'VDP', 'Organizations', 'Mobile', 'Secure', 'Development', 'YouTube', 'Encryption']"
yes,Developers fix multitude of vulnerabilities in Apache HTTP Server,High-impact SSRF and request smuggling bugs among flaws addressed in bumper patch cycle,"Numerous vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4, including high-impact server-side request forgery (SSRF) and request smuggling bugs.The Apache HTTP Server Project is a collaborative project to develop and maintain an open source software-based HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows. The technology is claimed to be the most popular web server on the internet.Catch up with the latest secure development newsA high-severity vulnerability with a CVSS score of 8.1, CVE-2021-40438, was discovered by the Apache HTTP security team. The security flaw allows a remote attacker to perform SSRF attacks, and stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the mod proxy module.Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a chosen uri-path could trick the web server into initiating requests to arbitrary systems. This would allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive data in the local network or send malicious requests to other servers.Meanwhile, CVE-2021-33193, rated as a moderate severity vulnerability, was reported by PortSwigger security researcher James Kettle on May 11.The flaw allows a crafted method sent through HTTP/2 to bypass validation controls and get forwarded by mod proxy, potentially leading to request splitting or cache poisoning.Those interested in learning more about Kettle’s HTTP/2 request smuggling research should check out our recent coverage from Black Hat USA.Patches issued on 16 September resolves these vulnerabilities, along with three others. These include a medium-severity NULL pointer dereference error, a boundary condition in module mod proxy uwsgi that could trigger a denial of service (system crash) condition and a low impact flaw only involving third party modules.All five flaws are resolved with HTTP Server 2.4.49.Check out Apache’s release notes for full details, here.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE VMware security warning: Multiple vulnerabilities in vCenter Server could allow remote network access",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/developers-fix-multitude-of-vulnerabilities-in-apache-http-server,"['Vulnerabilities', 'SSRF', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Research', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Meet TruffleHog – a browser extension for finding secret keys in JavaScript code,API keys are accidentally being leaked by websites. Here’s how to find them,"A new Chrome browser extension has been released to help bug bounty hunters find keys that have made their way into JavaScript online.The open source extension, now available on GitHub, is called TruffleHog and is the work of Truffle Security.The cybersecurity firm’s co-founder, Dylan Ayrey, said in a blog post dated September 19 that often, API Keys for software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud providers are making their way into JavaScript, and so the company is “proud” to offer a Chrome extension able to find them.In a video describing the extension, Mike Ruth, infrastructure security engineer at Bex, said that such keys could be utilized to “access something we shouldn’t”.Ayrey was able to find one such secret – an AWS key that was buried in the code of the front page of weather.com, a domain that has received over 740 million visitors in the past six months.Truffle shuffleThe original TruffleHog tool was originally released back in 2017 as a git repository scanner.However, it proved controversial after it was used by a member of the drone hacking community to discover leaks in drone developer DJI’s enterprise GitHub repository.Read more about the latest open source hacking toolsThe developer allegedly responsible for the accidental leaks was fined and jailed by the Chinese government.This time around, Ayrey told The Daily Swig that he worked with HackerOne and a few select researchers in an early beta to clean up “low-hanging fruit” ahead of public release, and the extension was prompted by the need to examine cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) security flaws – an area the researcher says “has not been explored much”.Flip the scriptAccording to Ayrey, many of today’s SaaS applications are built in a way that “encourages frontend applications to contain keys in their JavaScript”.Many are not accidents, nor are they in “observable text blocks”, the developer says, but are actually in active use by JavaScript on a page when APIs allow CORS.Some APIs may have permissive CORS settings, encouraging websites to make requests to an API – such as AWS – but as they are credentialed, a common method employed by website owners is to employ JavaScript that contains the credentials necessary.RECOMMENDED HAProxy vulnerability enables HTTP request smuggling attacks“Because multiple frontend applications often consume the same backend API, many internal apps unfortunately get scopes with permissive CORS settings,” Ayrey commented.“Unfortunately, CORS issues can often cascade and lead to multiple points of failure compromising the integrity of the keys on internal apps.”This may result in a foreign origin able to make requests to internal apps and APIs – and, potentially, become an avenue for key theft. TruffleHog will scan for these keys, which could then potentially be reported to vendors for bug bounties.In addition, the software is able to detect exposed and related .git repositories and .env files which may contain credentials and scan backends for them, the developer says. A check has also been included for environment variable scripts.There are limitations to the extension, however. Ayrey says that at the current time, the extension reads out full document trees, parses all of the JavaScript links, and fetches static assets twice for scanning, which can impact performance levels. There is also no caching.The extension is currently undergoing a security audit by Google for the Chrome Store and so, as of now, can only be side-loaded.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Raider: A tool to test authentication in web applications",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/meet-trufflehog-a-browser-extension-for-finding-secret-keys-in-javascript-code,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Vulnerabilities', 'JavaScript', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Amazon', 'Authentication', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Google', 'Chrome', 'GitHub', 'Privacy', 'API', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'IoT', 'Government', 'Research', 'China', 'Asia']"

no,Netgear fixes RCE flaw in routers’ parental controls feature,"Bug in third-party code offers salutary lessons around enterprise risk management, say researchers","UPDATED Multiple Netgear routers contained a third-party vulnerability that could lead to remote code execution (RCE) via Manipulator-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, security researchers have revealed.Now patched, the vulnerability (CVE-2021-40847) was found in the update process for Circle, a third-party application that provides parental control features in the affected, small office/home office (SOHO) devices.The Circle update daemon,circled, “connects to Circle and Netgear to obtain version information and updates” for its filtering database, infosec firm GRIMM explained in a blog post published on Tuesday (September 21).RELATED VPN users unmasked by zero-day vulnerability in Virgin Media routersHowever, database updates from Netgear were unsigned and downloaded via HTTP, which meant attackers could “respond tocircled update requests with a specially-crafted, compressed database file, the extraction of which gives the attacker the ability to overwrite executable files with attacker-controlled code.”DNS-based MitMSuccessful exploitation of the high-severity bug (CVSS 8.1) hinges on attackers being able to intercept and modify a vulnerable router’s network traffic.But while the MitM “requirement does reduce the number of scenarios in which the vulnerability is exploitable, it doesn't change the impact of successful exploitation,” GRIMM told The Daily Swig.The researchers outlined a DNS-based MitM attack that raced DNS queries from the Circle update daemon. These races are reliably won with GRIMM’s proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, making code execution “trivial to obtain”, said GRIMM.Other forms of MitM attacks could potentially work too, added the firm.The researchers said compromised routers could also form “part of a larger chain to infiltrate more secure environments”.This could involve compromising the internet service provider (ISP) via phishing, before compromising vulnerable Netgear routers as well as computers connected to the devices via a flaw such as the PrintNightmare vulnerability, suggested GRIMM.Attackers could then pivot to the corporate network to “exfiltrate corporate data or launch further attacks”.‘Attack surface reduction’GRIMM also said the “vulnerability once again demonstrates the importance of attack surface reduction” given that the Circle update daemon, unlike the parental controls, is enabled by default.“While it doesn’t fix the underlying issue, simply disabling the vulnerable code when Circle is not in use would have prevented exploitation on most devices,” reads the blog post.Read more of the latest hardware security newsEven though SOHO devices are designed for home offices or small businesses, the dramatic increase in home working due to the Covid-19 pandemic highlights a blind spot for enterprises, argued GRIMM.“SOHO devices typically fly under the radar when it comes to cybersecurity risk management,” said the infosec firm, which recommends that enterprises use virtual private networks (VPNs) to mitigate SOHO risks.GRIMM first attempted to notify the vendor of the flaw on July 23, making three attempts overall before notifying the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on August 9 and subsequently coordinating with Netgear.The vendor released firmware upgrades on September 21. Affected models include R6400v2, R6700, R6700v3, R6900, R6900P, R7000, R7000P, R7850, R7900, R8000, and RS400.Netgear has not responded to additional queries from The Daily Swig.

The Beego project is available on GitHub.Read more of the latest open source software security newsLast month, application security researcher Omri Inbar, who is also a member of the Checkmarx team, disclosed the XSS vulnerability to Beego.Tracked as CVE-2021-39391, the bug, of which a CVSS score is yet to be assigned, was found in the administration panel of Beego v2.0.1.Speaking to The Daily Swig, Inbar said that when a user navigates to a page on a website managed by the framework, the request details – such as the requested URL and Method type – are then logged and stored on the ‘Request Statistics’ page in the administrator panel.However, it was possible for attackers to try to navigate to a page that did not exist while including a payload – such as HTML tags or JavaScript – and, as there is a lack of sanitization, this would then be forwarded to the Request Statistics page and would run on the admin’s browser.Blind XSSThis form of attack is known as a blind XSS (a variant of a stored XSS) because the potential victim needs to run a payload before the attacker knows whether or not the code has successfully been executed.In this case, it could be that a threat actor would be able to hijack accounts by stealing session cookies, initiate activities based on the victim’s privilege level, and more.Inbar reported the flaw on August 15.

yes,Device ‘breakage’ concerns persist days before Let’s Encrypt root cert expiry,Many devices and systems may not be ready for the switchover,"Let’s Encrypt’s root certificate is expiring in little over a week, breaking a chain of trust that could result in widespread problems.The certificate currently used by the non-profit certificate authority, the IdentTrust DST Root CA X3, will expire on September 30.A new root cert is ready to come into operation but even so, the changeover may not run smoothly, both independent experts and Let’s Encrypt itself warn.Catch up on the latest encryption-related news and analysisThe change potentially impacts anything that uses TLS/PKI (public key infrastructure) on everything from web servers to smartphones and internet-connected devices. Digital certificates that underpin HTTPS are issued by certificate authorities, with indexes updated through operating system updates.On updated systems the changeover is transparent. But if these indexes have not been updated for some time, then affected systems will not recognize the new Let’s Encrypt root certificate and the chain of trust will be broken. There are precedents for this.In May 2020, the AddTrust External CA Root expired leaving organisations such as Roku, Stripe, Spreedly, and many others with problems as a result.Ch-ch-changesWhether or not the Let’s Encrypt root cert change will sever the chain of trust that underpins secure connections from a device or server broadly depends on how up to date a technology is, although in practice there’s more factors involved than this simple benchmark alone.Web security expert Scott Helme told The Daily Swig: “The device needs to either not check the expiration date of the root (so it will keep working regardless) or the device needs to have updated recently enough to get the new ISRG root. Any other device will fail.”Servers must also be configured correctly. “They need to have an updated certificate chain to serve to clients,” Helme explained.Research carried out so far by Helme and others suggests some breakage is all but certain, even though the extent of potential problems is far less clear cut. In a detailed technical blog post, Helme outlines the root certificate issue and points to potential faultlines where things might break.Systems depending on OpenSSL 1.0.2, released in January 2015 and last updated in December 2019, is particularly at risk along with earlier libraries. Manual updates on these systems are required, as explained in an OpenSSL advisory.Catch up with the latest internet infrastructure newsA range of older Windows, Mac, iOS, and other clients could run into trouble, as listed by Helme. Older versions of Microsoft’s IIS web server software may be at risk too, although this remains unproven.“IIS looks like it has some manual work required for the transition to be smooth, but it’s not too much,” Helme explained. “The problem is people won’t know it needs doing until it breaks and they figure out why.”Point breakIn response to queries from The Daily Swig, Let’s Encrypt thanked Helme for his research and acknowledge the root certificate breakage issue was real, while suggesting the main area of concern lies with Android devices.“In order to make the transition easier, primarily for Android clients, we got a new cross-sign[ature] that extends past the life of the expiring root,” Josh Aas, executive director of the Internet Security Research Group at Let’s Encrypt, explained.Aas went on to offer specific advice:Probably the most important things people can do in advance of the expiration are look at how many clients are using affected versions of OpenSSL (an issue Scott described nicely in his post) and older versions of Android. Encourage clients to upgrade where possible and if it's not possible look into whether serving a certificate chain with our new cross-sign makes sense.Helme commented: “Anecdotally, I think Let’s Encrypt are used more for websites, and their typical client will be a web browser, which puts them in a better position here with less likely issues to come… That said, I can’t shake the feeling that at least one important thing, somewhere, will break.”The researcher concluded: “The main concern will be slightly older devices/software and we can only take a guess at how widespread that is. In truth we will never know everything that will break until it breaks!”RECOMMENDED New iCloud Private Relay service leaks users’ true IP addresses, researcher claims",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/device-breakage-concerns-persist-days-before-lets-encrypt-root-cert-expiry,"['Encryption', 'Industry', 'News', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'IoT', 'Android', 'Hardware', 'Research', 'Microsoft', 'Windows', 'Apple']"
no,VMware security warning: Multiple vulnerabilities in vCenter Server could allow remote network access,Several issues including one critical bug have been remedied in latest patch cycle,"Multiple critical security vulnerabilities in two VMware network administration tools that could allow an attacker to have full access to an organization’s network have been patched.Users of the vCenter Server and Cloud Foundation products are urged to update immediately to protect against the issues, which are being tracked collectively as VMSA-2021-0020.The most critical issue (CVE-2021-22005) is a file upload vulnerability that can be used to execute commands and software on the vCenter Server Appliance.A security advisory issued yesterday (September 21) warns that the vulnerability can be used by anyone who can reach vCenter Server over the network to gain access, regardless of the configuration settings of vCenter Server.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsWhile the other issues have lower CVSS scores, VMware has warned that they may still be usable to an attacker that is already inside an organization’s network.The advisory reads: “One of the biggest problems facing IT today is that attackers often compromise a desktop and/or user account on the corporate network, and then patiently and quietly use that to break into other systems over long periods of time.“They steal confidential data, intellectual property, and at the end install ransomware and extort payments from their victims.“Less urgent security vulnerabilities can still be potential tools in the hands of attackers, so VMware always recommends patching to remove them.”Patch batchAmong the other bugs in vCenter Server are a local privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2021-21991), a reverse proxy bypass vulnerability (CVE-2021-22006), and improper permission local privilege escalation vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-22015).Chris Sedgwick, director of security operations at Talion, commented: “Due to its global prevalence VMWare is a lucrative platform for attackers to target, and recently VMWare exploits have been extremely popular, with sophisticated state-backed groups and intelligence services utilizing them to assist in the successful execution of their campaigns.RECOMMENDED APT focus: ‘Noisy’ Russian hacking crews are among the world’s most sophisticated“Back in May, a similar exploit in vCenter was disclosed after Russian threat groups were exploiting it. Therefore, it is especially important for users to take swift action by quickly follow the recommended actions and implement the security updates for VMWare.”There is a workaround available to mitigate the most critical vulnerability, however users are advised to patch their software against all issues.VMware wrote: “All vulnerabilities, even ones with lower CVSS scores, are tools in the hands of attackers. We urge customers to patch vCenter Server immediately.”More information including a FAQ can be found on the VMware blog.YOU MAY LIKE New iCloud Private Relay service leaks users’ true IP addresses, researcher claims",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vmware-security-warning-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-vcenter-server-could-allow-remote-network-access,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'Organizations', 'Russia', 'DevSecOps', 'Industry', 'News', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Ransomware', 'Enterprise', 'Authentication', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques']"
no,APT focus: ‘Noisy’ Russian hacking crews are among the world’s most sophisticated,Unpacking the Matryoshka dolls behind Kremlin-backed cybercrime campaigns,"State-sponsored Russian cyber espionage groups are among the most sophisticated of the nation-state threat actors, with an added flair for deception that makes them the canniest of adversaries.Experts quizzed by The Daily Swig said that Russian cyber-threat actors are among the best in the world, on a par with the top groups operating out of China, and with similar capabilities to western intelligence agencies – especially those with close links to the Federal Security Service (FSB) or military.What are the techniques and tactics of Russian threat actors?Russian state-sponsored actors typically have more sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) alongside custom malware development capabilities and tighter operational security when compared to other groups.Xueyin Peh, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows, told The Daily Swig: “Russia-linked APT groups are arguably some of the most technically advanced state-sponsored threat groups.“They have used techniques that enable them to remain undetected for long periods of time, such as in the supply chain attack leveraging SolarWinds’ Orion Platform (which likely began as early as Spring 2020 but was only made known publicly in December 2020).“This large-scale intrusion and the multiple techniques used to obfuscate their activity are testament to the technical prowess of these groups. In comparison, very few other state-associated APT groups – probably only those linked to the People's Republic of China – have conducted supply chain attacks of similar scale,” Peh added.The recent SolarWinds campaign that drew so much attention to the threat of Russian cyber espionage was actually atypical for Russian actors in its use of a technology supply chain access vector, according to some threat intel experts.SOLARWINDS ATTACK Hackers could have launched supply chain attack months earlier than previously thoughtPaul Prudhomme, head of threat intelligence advisory at IntSights, explained: “Russian cyber espionage groups have not historically used such attack vectors on any significant scale. Indeed, technology supply chain campaigns are more typical of their Chinese counterparts.“This adoption of a new technique could indicate a willingness to emulate the practices of other actors.”Vince Warrington, CEO of infosec firm Dark Intelligence, added that “Chinese state-backed attacks tend to be concerned with long-term intelligence gathering, so they tend to be slow moving, methodical, and with the aim of being able to infiltrate an organisation and extract data over the long term – think years instead of days or months.“The Russian approach, meanwhile, has a much more short-term focus and is more concerned with gathering and exploiting data right now. Therefore, their tactics tend to be ‘noisier’ than their Chinese counterparts.“Whereas China wishes to be the proverbial ‘ghost in the system’, the Russian state-backed groups are more likely to leave traces of their presence.”Daniel Smith, head of security researchat Radware, commented: “Nation-state and state-sponsored threat actors in Russia tend to use cyber tactics as a geopolitical lever.“In contrast, Chinese nation-state and state-sponsored threat actors’ objectives are aligned with data collection and global surveillance.”‘Russian state-backed threat groups are more likely to leave traces of their presence’How are Russian cyber-threat groups evolving?Yana Blachman, threat intelligence specialist at Venafi, told The Daily Swig: “Russian state-sponsored APT groups make use of highly sophisticated TTPs to conduct disinformation, propaganda, espionage, and destructive cyber-attacks on a global scale.“Unlike other groups that reuse code, use OS code or even buy tools, Russian APT groups are known to use their own tailor-made tools for their campaigns, with customised approaches for each target. They continue to develop new tools and redevelop old ones, and their TTPs prioritise operational security and defence evasion, making Russian APT activity very hard to detect.”Catch up on the latest cybercrime news and analysisRussian cybercrime gangs have dominated the cyber threat landscape for many years.“These groups have not only developed highly sophisticated toolsets, they have also developed a means of monetising their activities, and are organized like traditional criminal gangs with defined roles and processes,” according to Blachman, a former officer of ‘Unit 8200’, an elite signals intelligence unit of the Israel Defense Forces.“They are known to favour ransomware, although many are now making use of both Ransomware-as-a-Service and Malware as-a-Service, which lowers the bar for others wishing to get involved with cybercrime.”Russia-linked threat groups have also used false flags operations to throw those conducting investigations off the scent.Some prominent examples included the disruption of French television network TV5Monde in 2015 and the Olympic Destroyer campaign in 2018. The latter malware targeted the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.Russia-linked APT groups have also hijacked systems used by APT groups associated with other nation-states.In 2017, the Russia-affiliated ‘Turla’ APT group was found to have compromised server infrastructure used by the Iran-linked ‘APT34’ (aka OilRig, a presumed Iranian group).Turla reportedly used this access to deploy their own malware on computers that were already compromised with APT34’s malware. ""This instance of ‘spies hacking spies’ is rare, probably because it is likely to have consequences if discovered,"" said Digital Shadows’ Peh.How are Russian threat actors organized?The relationships between the various Russian cyber espionage groups remains unclear.IntSights’ Prudhomme explained: “In contrast to their Chinese and Iranian counterparts, there is no clear evidence that they extensively share malware development or infrastructure resources with each other via a ‘digital quartermaster’.”Units of the GRU military intelligence service, the SVR civilian foreign intelligence service, and the FSB domestic intelligence service conduct various cyber-espionage operations.The US has indicted 12 alleged members of Russia's General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for activity associated with APT28 (aka ‘Fancy Bear’), while APT29 (aka ‘Cozy Bear’) is more likely operating under the ambit of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).APT29 is the prime suspect in relation to the SolarWinds campaign“The high level of stealth and operational security in the SolarWinds campaign is consistent with what one would expect from a civilian foreign intelligence service that places a high priority on avoiding detection and maintaining access as long as possible, in order to collect as much intelligence as possible,” according to Prudhomme.BACKGROUND Who is behind APT29? What we know about this nation-state cybercrime group“In contrast, APT28, which is believed to operate under GRU authority, sometimes conducts much ‘noisier’ attacks – not necessarily out of a lack of operational security, but because the disruptive nature of their goals simply makes it impossible for them to avoid detection of the attack.”For example, Sandworm (a GRU unit like APT28) was allegedly responsible for the high-profile NotPetya ransomware attack on Ukraine in 2017, which aimed to disrupt the Ukrainian economy in support of Russian foreign policy objectives.The attack caused huge collateral damage against multinational companies that operate in Ukraine such as shipping giant Maersk.In an alleged attempt to influence the US presidential election, both APT28 and APT29 breached the network used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Stolen data was subsequently used to leak compromised information.Digital Shadows’ Peh commented: “This is not the first instance of Russia-linked targeting of US government agencies: prior to the compromise of the DNC, APT29 also conducted spear-phishing attacks against the Pentagon email system in August 2015, among other government agencies.“Similar activities also occurred in Europe, when APT28 is said to have targeted European political entities ahead of the 2018 EU Parliament elections.”What countries and organizations are being targeted by Russian threat groups?Governments and commercial defense organizations are top targets of Russian APTs because they can provide a wealth of political, diplomatic, and military intelligence.Russian threat groups primarily target western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors, but also private sector targets in the US and Europe.Energy organizations and other critical infrastructure are also important targets because of Russia's status as a leading energy producer and for the potential to disrupt the economies of targeted countries. Technology and telecommunications companies are also favored targets.In geographic terms, Ukraine is a top target for Russian cyber espionage and disruptive attacks in support of Russia’s expansion of its power and influence in the country. Other prime targets include the nation’s historic geopolitical and military adversaries in the US and the European and Turkish members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).Dark Intelligence’s Warrington commented: “Ukraine is, in effect, Russia’s testing ground for new cyber-attacks, and therefore we need to understand what happens there to predict what types of attack will happen to the West in the coming years.”What cyber-attacks have been attributed to Russia?Russian threat groups are thought to be behind some of the most high-profile attacks of recent years.Alongside the SolarWinds campaign, which targeted 80% of the Fortune 500, Russian state-sponsored APT group Sandworm (aka ‘Unit 74455’, a GRU unit distinct from APT28) is accused of being behind the destructive NotPetya cyber-attack that affected thousands of businesses worldwide in 2017.APT28, meanwhile, targeted the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and leaked drug-testing information related to international athletes in 2016.Despite high-profile media coverage of activities conducted by these Russia-linked APT groups, neither APT28 nor APT29 show any signs of stopping their malicious activities, as evidenced by the SolarWinds hack and other recent hacking campaigns.For example, in July 2021 reports emerged that APT29 hadcompromised the computer systems of the Republican National Committee (RNC) via a third-party provider.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Behind the Great Firewall: Chinese cyber-espionage adapts to post-Covid world with stealthier attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/apt-focus-noisy-russian-hacking-crews-are-among-the-worlds-most-sophisticated,"['Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Russia', 'China', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Network', 'Security', 'Phishing', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Government', 'Industry', 'News', 'Europe', 'Analysis', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Privacy', 'Malware', 'Ransomware', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Microsoft', 'OSINT', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'US', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'Spyware', 'Surveillance', 'IoT', 'Telecommunications', 'Asia']"
no,"New iCloud Private Relay service leaks users’ true IP addresses, researcher claims","De-anonymizing users of VPN-like service, launched with iOS 15 yesterday, is ‘easily accomplished’","An as-yet-unpatched vulnerability in Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay service for iOS 15 means it can leak users’ true IP addresses, a security researcher has claimed.iCloud Private Relay is a free upgrade provided for paying iCloud users in Apple’s latest mobile operating system update, which was launched yesterday (September 21).It has similarities to a VPN in that it encrypts web-browsing traffic and sends it through a relay to hide the contents, as well as the user’s location and IP address. Any websites visited should only see the proxy IP address assigned by iCloud.WebRTC leak vectorHowever, a security researcher has discovered that it can leak IP addresses through WebRTC, a browser API that allows websites to establish direct communication between website visitors – and which has been associated with similar weaknesses in other browsers in the past.WebRTC sets up communications by using the ICE (interactive connectivity establishment) framework. This involves collecting ‘ICE candidates’ that include the IP address or domain name, port, protocol, and other information. The browser will then return the ICE candidates to the browser application.However, writes Sergey Mostsevenko, a researcher and developer at browser fingerprinting library FingerprintJS, Safari is passing ICE candidates containing real IP addresses to the JavaScript environment.“De-anonymizing you then becomes a matter of parsing your real IP address from the ICE candidates – something easily accomplished with a web application,” he says.Prospects for a patchMostsevenko recommends either switching to a VPN or disabling JavaScript in Safari’s browser settings to turn off WebRTC – although this may affect how websites built with JavaScript are displayed.The researcher said the vulnerability has been fixed in the recently released MacOS Monterey beta. The stable macOS release is due some time in the fall.A patch may be forthcoming for Safari under iOS too, independent privacy researcher and consultant Dr Lukasz Olejnik tells The Daily Swig. “In general, it would not be that difficult to address it.”Read more of the latest Apple security newsFingerprintJS has alerted Apple to the problem, but says it has not yet received a response.“We think it is a pretty serious leak, as it impacts anyone who is using Private Relay since its launch with iOS 15, a spokesperson tells The Daily Swig. “Apple has marketed the new feature as protecting IP addresses from visited websites to protect user privacy, though due to this vulnerability IP addresses can be accessed.“The vulnerability undermines key functionality of the feature, and may give users a false sense of security as to how much of their private information is being protected while browsing.”The Daily Swig has contacted Apple for comment and we will update this article if we hear back.RELATED VPN users unmasked by zero-day vulnerability in Virgin Media routers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/new-icloud-private-relay-service-leaks-users-true-ip-addresses-researcher-claims,"['Apple', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Privacy', 'Mobile', 'Research', 'Browsers', 'Safari', 'JavaScript', 'API', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Surveillance']"
no,Weaponized ManageEngine flaw poses ‘serious risk’ to high-profile US targets – CISA,Warning from US government agency urges prompt triage,"Cyber-attackers have begun exploiting a newly discovered security vulnerability in ManageEngine, a self-service password management and single sign-on package.A run of attacks on the CVE-2021-40539 vulnerability has prompted the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the US Coast Guard, and the FBI to push out a joint alert urging enterprises to apply recently released patches.CVE-2021-40539 presents a critical authentication bypass risk affecting REST API URLs that could enable remote code execution”.Echoes of SolarWindsWorse yet, the flaws in the vulnerable ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus component pose a “serious risk to critical infrastructure companies” – not least because this sort of vulnerability is fodder for well-resourced state-sponsored attackers.Although not mentioned in the CISA’s alert, the agency is clearly worried there’s a potential that the vulnerability could inflict damage comparable to that wrought via the infamous 2019-20 SolarWinds Orion flaws.The SolarWinds vulnerabilities were the focus of supply chain attacks ultimately aimed at US government agencies and blamed on Russian government-backed attackers.The CISA alert makes it clear that attacks based on the recently discovered ManageEngine vulnerability are already taking place across multiple targets in many sensitive industries:APT cyber actors have targeted academic institutions, defense contractors, and critical infrastructure entities in multiple industry sectors – including transportation, IT, manufacturing, communications, logistics, and finance. Illicitly obtained access and information may disrupt company operations and subvert US research in multiple sectors.The route to attack is already tried and tested. “Successful compromise of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, via exploitation of CVE-2021-40539, allows the attacker to upload a .zip file containing a JavaServer Pages (JSP) webshell masquerading as an x509 certificate: service.cer.“Subsequent requests are then made to different API endpoints to further exploit the victim's system,” CISA added.Read more of the latest cyber-attack news and analysisSuccessful exploitation would allow an attacker to pop webshells, opening the door to all manner of malfeasance including, but likely not limited to, compromising administrator credentials, conducting lateral movement, and stealing system files.Zoho, the firm that develops and markets ManageEngine technology, released updates on September 6. Enterprise users should carry out triage on systems running the platform and either upgrade to ADSelfService Plus build 6114 (the best option) or keep earlier systems off the internet and check for potential indicators of compromise – assuming patching is not an immediate possibility.The CISA alert offers a rundown on indications of compromise and other information designed to help sysadmins.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE VPN users unmasked by zero-day vulnerability in Virgin Media routers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/weaponized-manageengine-flaw-poses-serious-risk-to-high-profile-us-targets-cisa,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Authentication', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Government', 'Education', 'Logistics', 'Finance', 'API', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Passwords', 'OpSec']"

no,US policy change states healthcare apps must follow data breach notification rules,Connected devices such as fitness trackers also obliged to follow tougher privacy rules,"Updated policies from US federal regulators will mean that health-related apps and connected device vendors will need to comply with health data breach notification rules.Healthcare apps – which can track everything from glucose levels for those with diabetes to heart and sleep health – are collecting more and more sensitive and personal data from consumers.Healthcare and connected device vendors have a responsibility to secure data and to notify consumers when anything goes awry. Now, regulators have ruled that they ought to comply with the same data privacy and breach disclosure rules as mainstream healthcare providers.Catch up on the latest healthcare breach and security newsThe healthcare industry continues to explore how technology can benefit patients through app-based services including telehealth and self-monitoring – a trend that has picked up speed and urgency during the coronavirus pandemic.Additional privacy concerns arise because data harvested through connected devices, and healthcare apps might potentially be used to feed behavioral ads or power user analytics.Meanwhile, the need to protect healthcare data is also increasing as this information is valuable to scammers and cybercriminals.In response, regulators at the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have extended the existing Health Breach Notification Rule to cover healthcare app providers, makers of wearable fitness tracking devices, and related software.The rule itself – which is underpinned by provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 – was extended to healthcare app and wearable makers through a policy change.Argument for changeThe policy change was voted through by the FTC 3-2 in a split-decision that shows privacy regulations to regulate healthcare apps is an emerging area of policy that even regulators are still arguing about.“The rule ensures that entities not covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) face accountability when consumers’ sensitive health information is breached,” according to an FTC statement on the decision issued last week.For example, a health app would be covered under the FTC’s rule if it collects health information from a consumer and has the technical capacity to draw information through an API that enables synching with a consumer’s fitness tracker. There will be tough financial penalties for companies that fail to comply with the rules.The policy change means that vendors that hold fertility, heart health, glucose levels, and other health data must notify consumers in the event of a breach. App makers would need to notify the FTC, consumers, and (in some cases) the media.Big dataTrade journal eMarketer reports that 90,000 health apps were released last year. The vast majority (an estimated 88%) have the ability to collect and share user data.Some surveys suggest most consumers aren’t concerned with the privacy of their data collected by smartwatches or fitness trackers, though this is beside the point for vendors who face huge fines for non-compliance.The revamped regulatory regime adds extra compliance headaches for affected technology providers, several which have suffered security and privacy breaches over recent months.For example, an Android fitness app was caught sending sensitive information without encryption back in June, while flaws in an electronic health records software package discovered in June 2020 might also have become a candidate for disclosure, but only in the event any personal healthcare information was disclosed by software flaws in LibreHealth.RELATED Convenience over security: Mobile healthcare apps open up fresh risks to patients’ data",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/us-policy-change-states-healthcare-apps-must-follow-data-breach-notification-rules,"['Healthcare', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Compliance', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Privacy', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'Government', 'North', 'America', 'HIPAA']"

We are glad we’ve discovered them, and not hackers, and made the company aware of the possible misuse of the data so they could fix it before anything bad happened,” Diachenko told The Daily Swig.So far, Diachenko and Clario believe no data has been misused. “We believe that we caught the exposure before any misuse happened to this data,” said Diachenko. “We are happy that we discovered the data exposure, rather than the data leak, because it would be a huge one.”This is borne out by analysis from UK security firm Pentest People. “I looked at some of the raw breach data using some of Pentest People’s in-house tools and also checked the dark web for evidence of the EventBuilder data being traded,” Liam Follin, senior service development consultant for Pentest People. told The Daily Swig.“To date, there was no evidence that we could discover.”Attractive targetsHowever, security experts warn that similar breaches could happen in the future, especially as more web applications connect to cloud storage. Online events are also attractive targets to cybercriminals, due to the data they gather on attendees.“Other virtual event platforms should take heed of this breach to avoid exposing their own users to cyber threats” advised Follin. “Make sure that solutions are being tested properly, and that security is at the forefront of the development ethos.“It’s easy to blame developers for these mistakes, but ultimately developers need to be given adequate training and the time with which to secure applications.”Organizations, or individuals, that have used EventBuilder should also be cautious, especially if they receive unexpected emails or calls.“I always highlight that nothing can be better that an educated employee: an employee who follows cyber hygiene rules and manages data responsibly – in the office and at home,” said Diachenko.Pentest People’s Follin also advises organizations to invest in dark web monitoring, as this can detect breaches and emerging threats before data falls into the hands of criminals.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/eventbuilder-misconfiguration-exposes-personal-details-of-100-000-event-registrants,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Events', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Microsoft']"
no,VPN users unmasked by zero-day vulnerability in Virgin Media routers,Disclosure comes two years after privacy-busting flaw was discovered,"A zero-day vulnerability in Virgin Media Super Hub 3 routers enables attackers to unmask the true IP addresses of VPN users, security researchers have revealed.Fidus Information Security, a UK penetration testing consultancy, has published details of the flaw nearly two years after first alerting Virgin Media, a British telco, which referred Fidus to Liberty Global, its parent company.Fidus’ R&D team said it initially delayed disclosure for 12 months at the vendor’s request, but subsequent attempts to contact Virgin Media and Liberty Global then failed to elicit responses.However, Virgin Media has told The Daily Swig that it is currently working on a “technical fix” for what it also described it as an “edge-case issue, potentially impacting only a very small subset of customers” who use VPNs.Read more of the latest data privacy news and breachesResearchers were able to mount a DNS rebinding attack that revealed a VPN user’s IP address “by [the user] simply visiting a [malicious] webpage for a few seconds”, reads a blog post drafted by Fidus in March but eventually published last week.DNS rebinding attacks weaponize a victim’s browser by making it a proxy for attacking private networks.Privacy implicationsThe researchers successfully de-anonymized devices whose IP addresses were masked by most “market leading VPNs”, Fidus’ R&D team told The Daily Swig.However, some VPN providers repelled the attack by blocking access to local IP addresses by default.“Some blocked the attack by ‘accident’ by preventing LAN traffic but when this was turned off, as many people do, they instantly became vulnerable,” said Fidus.DON’T FORGET TO READ Mozilla offers transparency by publishing VPN audit“The privacy implications are quite severe in this scenario due to the silent nature of the vulnerability,” said Fidus. “In theory, it could be utilised on any popular (likely compromised) webpage and be used to unmask users who are browsing using a VPN.“Other, more unlikely, scenarios are nation-state or law-enforcement capable bodies using this to unmask both criminals but also those utilising a VPN solution for their own safety.”However, a Virgin Media spokesperson said that “a very specific set of circumstances would need to be in place for a customer to be impacted, meaning that the risk to them is very low.”Hardware supply chainThe researchers tested the exploit against the ARRIS TG2492, but Fidus believes the vulnerability probably works against all related models.Liberty Global has deployed the ARRIS series of DOCSIS fiber routers through multiple internet service providers that it owns worldwide, said Fidus.DEEP DIVES Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowThe ARRIS brand is actually owned by network infrastructure provider CommScope, but Fidus believes Liberty Global owns the firmware.“They were really vague with all the information which really didn’t help us in any shape or form,” said Fidus. “We did request information for who else to pass it to and that was never given to us.”TimelineLiberty Global was first alerted to the vulnerability (CVE-2019-16651) on October 20, 2019.On February 21, 2020, the company requested a year-long delay to public disclosure – which Fidus agreed to.However, three subsequent requests for updates from Liberty Global – on December 9 and 21 of 2020, then March 15, 2021 – failed to elicit a response from the vendor.Although Virgin Media has yet to complete remediation, the company said: “We have strong security measures in place to protect our network and keep our customers secure. We are not aware of any customers being affected by this issue and they do not need to take any action.”However, Fidus advises users to “firewall traffic to the router (which obviously isn't overly user friendly) or ensure LAN traffic on a VPN is blocked” if they want to protect themselves.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vpn-users-unmasked-by-zero-day-vulnerability-in-virgin-media-routers,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'VPN', 'Research', 'DNS', 'Hardware', 'Privacy', 'Surveillance', 'Telecommunications', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Browsers', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Industry', 'News', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks']"

DHSS technology officer Scott McCutcheon said that “all affected systems remain offline as we diligently and meticulously move through the three phases of our response”.The department said it delayed its latest announcement, which states it has reported the breach to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Alaska Personal Information Protection Act (APIPA), “to avoid interference with a criminal investigation”.Help for AlaskansA hotline will be operational from Tuesday (September 21) to field questions from concerned residents and, if they wish, help them sign up for a free credit monitoring service.“Alaskans entrust us with important health information, and we take that responsibility very seriously,” said DHSS commissioner Adam Crum.“Unfortunately, despite our best efforts at data protection, as the investigation into the cyber-attack progressed, it became clear that a breach of personal and health information had occurred.”DHSS’ previous statement on the incident, on August 4, said there was “no current evidence that Alaskans’ protected health information or personally identifiable information was stolen”.DHSS technology officer Scott McCutcheon said at the time that “the attackers took steps to maintain … long-term access even after they were detected”.In the latest statement DHSS CISO Thor Ryan commented: “DHSS is continuing work to further strengthen its processes, tools and staff to be more resilient to future cyber-attacks.”RELATED Olympus insists medical services ‘uninterrupted’ by malware attack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/alaska-department-of-health-reveals-data-breach-potentially-exposing-residents-financial-health-information,"['US', 'Government', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Malware', 'North', 'America', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Epik hack exposes lax security practices at controversial web host,"ISP guilty of ‘laziest design possible’, critics allege","UPDATED Hacktivists affiliated with Anonymous are pouring over the entrails of a cyber-attack against controversial web host Epik that led onto the leak of customer data.US-based web host and domain registrar Epik is known for offering services to sites that carry far-right and extremist content including social networks Gab and Parler (a locus of planning for the January 2021 US Capitol riots) and image board 8chan.In early September, Epik reportedly offered services to a “whistleblower” site run by antiabortion activists based in Texas, placing it in the crosshairs of hacktivists involved in Operation Jane, the campaign against the controversial Texas Heartbeat Act.Read more of the latest cyber-attack newsAnonymous hacked and defaced the Epik-hosted Republican Party of Texas on September 11, following this up with an assault on Epik’s infrastructure days later.Masses of stolen data from Epik were subsequentially released through the DDoSecrets organization.Hacktivists boasted of releasing a “decade’s worth of data” in databases containing domain ownership records, transaction details, emails, and unsorted or at least unindexed, encryption keys among the 32GB trove of leaked data.In response to queries from The Daily Swig, Epik said only that it was investigating the alleged breach.In a brief statement on Wednesday, Jessica Robison, Epik’s Director of Client Services, said:We are aware of the messages that have been posted.? We take the security of our clients’ data extremely seriously, and we are investigating the allegation.Using random samples of customer data exposed in the hack, journalists including those from The Record and The Daily Dotconfirmed that the leaked data was real.Data breach experts polled by The Daily Swig confirmed that the dump of information looked legit.While the security shortcomings that evidentially led to a hack on its systems remain unclear, data encryption and privacy policies applied by Epik were lax, according to those revelling in the web host’s misfortunes.An internet user offering snippets from what’s become known as the “EpikFail hack” offered The Daily Swig a run-down of the company’s operational and network security shortcomings.At the very least, Epik is guilty of the laziest design possible. They should have segmented their user’s data across various databases, utilized multiple access credentials, and the only user they should’ve had access to that is their production application.Instead, Epik took the easy way out. They charged their customers an additional fee to “protect their data” (via a Domain Add-On from http://Anonymize.com) and when a customer would sign up, Anonymize would assign them a UserID, which is fairly standard.Unfortunately, Epik chose to use that UserID as the prefix for the domain’s WHOIS registration’s contact email address. Thus, providing the keys to go directly from domain name to “anonymous” domain owner with one line of code.All these oversights were far from accidental and arose because customer protection was not part of Epik’s culture, according to the source.“This is evident by passwords stored as plaintext and unhashed credit cards with expiration dates in the future,” they concluded.The Daily Swig got back in touch with Epik on Friday to challenge it on its earlier statements and request an update on what it was telling its customers.Troy Hunt updated the haveibeenpwned database to support victims of the Epik breach over the weekend, in the process offering the clearest index of the nature and extent of the breach.The data included more than 15 million unique email addresses (including anonymised versions for domain privacy), names, phone numbers, physical addresses, purchase records and passwords. The data relates not only to Epik customers, but also scraped WHOIS records belonging to individuals and organisations who were not Epik customers, according to Hunt.This story was updated to add comment from breach guru Troy HuntRELATED STORY Texas Republican Party website defaced in ‘Anonymous’ protest against abortion law",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/epik-hack-exposes-lax-security-practices-at-controversial-web-host,"['US', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Government', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Email', 'Security', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'North', 'America', 'Cybercrime', 'Legal', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Privacy']"
no,Google announces partnership to review security of open source software projects,"Tech giant will lend its support to security reviews of eight projects, including Git, Lodash, and Laravel ","After pledging $100 million towards improving open source security last month, Google is sponsoring security reviews of eight projects through a partnership with the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF).OSTIF has initially identified 25 potential projects, all of which are dubbed critical, according to an announcement on the OSTIF website.The shortlist is derived from the OpenSSF Criticality Score Project, work by the Linux Foundation and Harvard LISH, and a paper from the University of Washington titled ‘Underproduction: An Approach for Measuring Risk in Open Source Software’.“Once we had constructed a list of projects that we wanted to review, we worked with our advisory council who helped narrow the much larger list down to the 25 highest-priority projects,” OSTIF executive director Derek Zimmer tells The Daily Swig.Read more of the latest news about open source software“This was a complicated task, because if you ask anyone in open source what the 25 most important open source projects are, you’ll often get completely different lists with little to no overlap, so doing this as a data-driven initiative helped us to get some bedrock to build upon and work toward a consensus.”Google’s support will go towards reviewing eight libraries, frameworks, and apps, including:Git – de facto version control software used in modern DevOpsLodash – a modern JavaScript utility libraryLaravel – a PHP web application framework used by many modern, full-stack web applications, including integrations with Google CloudSlf4j – a logging facade for various Java logging frameworksJackson-core and Jackson-databind – a JSON for Java, streaming API, and extra shared components, and the base for the Jackson data-bind packageHttpcomponents-core and Httpcomponents-client – responsible for creating and maintaining a toolset of low-level Java components focused on HTTP and associated protocolsDON’T MISS OWASP shakes up web app threat categories with release of draft Top 10Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Centre, believes the projects have been well chosen, with both the Jackson-databind component and Lodash having been identified as a highly vulnerable component in a majority of audited applications in the 2021 and 2020 OSSRA reports.“In both cases, the vulnerabilities in question related to how those core components process user data,” he tells The Daily Swig.“Given how consumers of open source components often assume those components are released following commercial software paradigms, any security gaps in a foundational component like those being audited by OSTIF have the potential to impact a large number of applications and, by extension, end users.”Success so farOSTIF has already had its successes – for example, its end-to-end review of Unbound, an open source DNS resolver used to secure websites, led to the patching of one critical, five high, and five medium severity issues.“Software security is hard, and there’s a limited number of people that can look through the source code of an application and find issues,” says Zimmer.“To make the assumption that major issues in the top 100,000 open source projects are being found with a reasonable frequency would be a mistake, and automated testing can only go so far.”YOU MAY LIKE Supply chain attacks against the open source ecosystem soar by 650% – report",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-announces-partnership-to-review-security-of-open-source-software-projects,"['Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Research', 'Google', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevOps']"
no,Manufacturing industry must limit internal data access to prevent sensitive leaks – report,Sector advised to monitor what employees can do on company networks,"Manufacturers are risking devastating data breaches by giving employees too much access to sensitive files, a new report has warned.The study from Varonis, which was published yesterday (September 15), “highlights serious problems with the overexposure of data”, said researchers.It analyzed more than four billion files from 50 organizations to determine the pitfalls organizations in the manufacturing and engineering industries face.For example, it found that employees can access an average of six million files on their first day on the job, while 44% of organizations left more than 1,000 files open to every employee.More than one in five had around 10,000 files accessible.“That level of exposure is very concerning and shows that the manufacturing sector has a long way to go when it comes to data security,” Matt Lock, technical director at Varonis, told The Daily Swig.Read more of the latest news about data breaches“Overexposed data increases risk dramatically – especially if the information is sensitive,” Lock added.“Think of it as your blast radius – all the damage an attacker could do if they compromise just one user.“If an employee who has access to millions of files clicks on a phishing email, a malicious Word document, or falls victim to a zero-day, the results could be devastating.”Top targetThe study, titled ‘2021 Data Risk Report – Manufacturing’ (PDF), states that the manufacturing industry was the fifth most targeted sector in 2020.And while it has, on average, fewer overall exposed files than other highly targeted industries such as finance and healthcare, it still averaged more than 1,675 exposed sensitive files per terabyte of data.RELATED Data breach class actions: US Supreme Court decision may tilt the odds in favor of defendant organizationsThe report recommends: “For these companies with overexposed sensitive data, limiting open access by enforcing a least privilege model is a critical part of risk reduction.“Manufacturing companies store above-average amounts of stale sensitive data, which increases their attack surface and inflates storage costs unnecessarily.”The report’s authors added that, on average, 78% of an organization’s sensitive files are ‘stale’ and could be deleted or archived.And 56% of companies had more than 500 accounts with passwords that never expire, with a further 44% having more than 1,000 active ‘ghost user’ accounts enabled.AdviceSo what should employees in the industry do to help protect their organization against data leaks?Speaking to The Daily Swig, Lock said: “The advice is simple – but enacting it can be more difficult.“CISOs should ensure that data is protected and overexposure kept to a minimum. If an employee doesn’t need access to a file to do their job, they shouldn’t be able to get anywhere near it.”Lock also warned about the dangers of ‘ghost users’, which can include former employees who still have to access their accounts.In recent years, there have been a number of cases of disgruntled ex-workers logging into their company account to view or steal data.READ Data breaches are costing more than ever, as organizations take longer to detect attacks, apply patches – reportThere is also danger in inactive and unmonitored accounts, which could be accessed by malicious actors unbeknown to the company.Lock said: “Organizations should also be aware of the risks posed by ghost users – inactive users and service accounts that remain enabled after employees leave their jobs.“These accounts allow attackers to brute-force their way into networks and steal data.“Inactive privileged admin accounts must be removed because they allow could cybercriminals to escalate privileges.

no,Meris botnet leverages HTTP pipelining to smash DDoS attack records,Source of attacks ‘almost entirely composed of Mikrotik devices’,"A new botnet malware is spreading across the internet – and according to new research, it might have already infected 200,000 devices.Called Meris, the botnet is reminiscent of Mirai, the IoT botnet that wreaked havoc in 2016, though it has unique characteristics too, reveals research from DDoS mitigation company Qrator Labs.In recent days Meris has struck security publication KrebsOnSecurity and Yandex with what the Russian tech giant described as the biggest Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack in history.Mikro-targetingMeris is currently targeting devices made by MikroTik, a Latvian manufacturer of network routers.“We do not know precisely what particular vulnerabilities led to the situation where MikroTik devices are being compromised on such a large scale,” Qrator Labs wrote in a blog post that details the botnet. Though the researchers said it could be due to “some vulnerability that was either kept secret before the massive campaign’s start or sold on the black market”.Alexander Lyamin, CEO at Qrator Labs, told The Daily Swig: “We see here a pretty substantial attacking force – dozens of thousands of host devices – growing. “Separately, Qrator Labs saw the 30,000 host devices in actual numbers through several attacks, and Yandex collected the data of about 56,000 attacking hosts.”RELATED What is DDoS? A complete guide“However, we suppose the number to be higher – probably more than 200,000 devices, due to the rotation and absence of will to show the ‘full force’ attacking at once,” added Lyamin.In a statement published on Friday, MikroTik said that the devices were likely compromised via a vulnerability that was patched in 2018.“Unfortunately, closing the vulnerability does not immediately protect these routers,” MikroTik said. “If somebody got your password in 2018, just an upgrade will not help. You must also change password, re-check your firewall if it does not allow remote access to unknown parties, and look for scripts that you did not create.”Overwhelming capacityAccording to Qrator Labs, Meris has conducted devastating attacks against targets in New Zealand, the US, and Russia. Due to its capacity for very large requests per second (RPS), Meris can overwhelm almost any infrastructure including highly robust networks, the researchers warn.Qrator Labs said the Meri attacks against Yandex peaked at 21.8 million RPS.Catch up on the latest DDoS attack news and analysisCloudflare, which recently reported another huge DDoS attack, corroborated Qrator’s findings.“We can confirm that the source of the 17.2M RPS attack we saw previously was almost entirely composed of MikroTik devices running open SOCKS proxies, and utilized HTTP pipelining,” Patrick Donahue, director of product at Cloudflare, told The Daily Swig.Donahue said that unlike the Mirai botnet, the new botnet consists of a smaller number of compromised, high-resource network infrastructure devices that are used to proxy attack traffic originating from cloud VPS instances.“We continue to see daily attacks from this botnet,” he said.Donahue warned that proxying attack traffic makes it easier for the attackers to generate high volumes of L7 (application layer) attack traffic using powerful cloud servers, and makes it harder to figure out where the attack traffic is being generated from.HTTP pipeliningAccording to Qrator, the botnet is exploiting ‘HTTP pipelining’, a feature that allows clients to send requests to web servers in batches without waiting for individual responses.“HTTP pipelining is what allows this botnet to achieve such an astonishingly high numbers in RPS, and at the same time it makes detection and mitigation of attacks much easier since we know only one web browser using this feature,” Lyamin said.However, even when a pipelining attack is detected and blocked, a full batch of HTTP requests will remain in the target server’s pipeline. The rise of Meris is a reminder of the complexity and continual evolution of DDoS attacks.“DDoS is a real, actual, ever-evolving risk for any internet business,” Lyamin said. “Have a mitigation plan in place. Update it frequently. If you were ready for the previous generation of bandwidth-based attacks, it doesn’t mean that you’re ready for the application layer, proven by all the victims of Meris.”RECOMMENDED Nation-state threat: How DDoS-over-TCP technique could amplify attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/meris-botnet-leverages-http-pipelining-to-smash-ddos-attack-records,"['DDoS', 'Research', 'Cyber-attacks', 'OpSec', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Cloudflare', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Russia', 'Europe']"
no,UK armed forces confirm cyber as fifth dimension of warfare,"Armed forces needs to adapt to recruit more digital quartermasters rather than conventional soldiers, conference attendees told","The UK’s armed forces are planning to make significant investments in cybersecurity capabilities and skills over the next few years, according to the country’s military leaders.Cyber’s status as the “fifth domain” of warfare – alongside sea, land, air, and more recently, space – is forcing defense forces across the West to change how they operate.This re-evaluation ranges from prioritizing the protection of digital communications, through bolstering defensive and offensive cybersecurity capabilities to building skills.Building a military Internet of ThingsThe UK military – along with other NATO nations – is investing in robotics and autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, computer-based or synthetic training, and what is being termed a “military Internet of Things”.At this week’s DSEI conference in London, the roll-call of sci-fi technologies on show even included a commitment to develop directed energy ‘laser’ weapons.All these changes in operational priorities poses challenges for both the UK Ministry of Defence and the armed forces themselves. Although senior officers complain – at least in private – about the ‘Xbox generation’, the needs of today’s armed forces, and requirements for the next generation of recruits, lean more heavily on technology skills than ever. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the cyber space.Adapt or dieGeneral Sir Patrick Sanders heads the UK’s Strategic Command, the military organization responsible for multi-domain operations, including space and cyber. Gen Sanders told delegates at DSEI that he needs personnel who can operate across all the dimensions of warfare, or “penta-phibians”.These future military personnel will have “the ability to operate seamlessly across all five domains [of warfare],” he said. “We’re going to need to think radically about the career model, training, and education that accelerates the pace of this evolution because if we don’t adapt, we will at best become exquisite but irrelevant – and at worst we will die.”Q divisionThis will force a fundamental change in the skills the armed forces need, and ultimately, who they recruit. As one senior officer noted, being able to run a mile and a half in nine minutes could be less important than an aptitude for technology. Being able to code will be equally important.“We are going to need access to fundamentally different skills and talent and to place equal value and afford equal status to computer scientists, data engineers, and cyber operators as we do on the traditional warrior elite,” Gen Sanders said. Referencing the James Bond movie franchise, he added: “I have more need of Q than I do 007 or M.”General Sanders’ comments build on the direction for the UK’s defence, foreign, and cybersecurity policies, set out in the Government’s Integrated Review this Spring.Explainer: What does the UK’s Integrated Review mean for cybersecurity?Although it is not immediately apparent at events such as DSEI, where floorspace is still dominated by “big ticket” defense hardware such as attack helicopters, armoured personnel carriers, and even robotic tanks, at the MOD the shift is towards using digital technology as a force multiplier in order to make conventional forces more effective. This includes investments in areas such as AI and machine learning (ML).“There is a huge dependence [on data and IT] now. Every industry is now able to do more and do it better with data and analysis, and defense is no different,” Cate Pye, a defense and cyber security expert at PA Consulting, told The Daily Swig. “The key will be to understand what questions need to be answered and how to use and get the information to make those decisions. “Then AI and ML will need to be deployed to help decision makers so that the volume of data does not obscure the golden nuggets of information.”Integrated by instinctTo build an effective strategy, all this must be linked to both defensive, and offensive, cyber capabilities and closer ties between individual armed forces, other government departments, and industry.“Following the Integrated Review, we are seeing investment in skills, multi-domain integration, and an appreciation that this is needed across the five defence domains and the rest of UK government,” explained Pye. “This is leading to greater cooperation and should, ultimately, lead to a requirement that new initiatives are 'integrated by instinct' and that they will not get funding unless they are.”Read more of the latest cybersecurity news from the UKThe UK’s armed forces have a well-earned reputation for adaptability – and for punching above their weight. The move to digitally-enabled forces that can hold their own in cyberspace, as well as on land, sea, or in the air, is just the latest challenge.“The defense sector is struggling with the cyber skills supply and demand problem just like every other industry,” Tara Wisniewski, EVP, advocacy, global markets and member engagement at (ISC)2, toldThe Daily Swig.“The shortage becomes an even bigger factor as these fighting forces reskill and reequip for a technology-driven battlefield of the future.“One of the key solutions to solving the skills shortage is to broaden the pool of candidates for defense positions, appealing to a more diverse set of mission-oriented people who can grow into cybersecurity roles and bring different perspectives to the work or a given deployment. “Inherent [to] this are commitments from the Ministry of Defence and external defense contractors to provide training and professional development, as well as clear career advancement opportunities that match or exceed those found in other private sector roles.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE OWASP shakes up web app threat categories with release of draft Top 10",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/uk-armed-forces-confirm-cyber-as-fifth-dimension-of-warfare,"['UK', 'Government', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Analysis', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'AI', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Remote code execution flaw allowed hijack of Motorola Halo+ baby monitors,Expectant parent finds severe security problems in his new baby monitor,"UPDATED Remote code execution (RCE) and comms protocol vulnerabilities that would have allowed baby monitors to be hijacked have been discovered and resolved.On Tuesday, cybersecurity researcher Randy Westergren published his findings on the security posture of the Motorola Halo+, a popular baby monitor.Westergren, whose day job is as the engineering director of US financial services company Marlette Funding, and his wife were expecting their first child and so went hunting for a suitable monitor, selecting the Motorola Halo+ as their preferred option.The Motorola Halo+ features an over-the-crib monitor, a handheld unit for parents, and a Wi-Fi-connected mobile application to monitor children, and their environment, in Full HD. The researcher decided the set-up “deserved a closer look”.Catch up with the latest IoT-related security newsIt was a matter of hours before Westergren discovered a pre-authentication RCE security flaw and the means to obtain a full root shell.Westergren began by examining the device’s listening services and reverse-engineering the monitor’s Android app, Hubble Connected for Motorola Monitors.Hubble Connected pulls information beyond simply the monitor’s camera feed and presents it in the user’s display. This data includes room temperature, night lights, and the status of the monitor’s light show projector.By examining system logs alone, it was possible to find the app’s API requests to gather this information, many of which involved services that interacted with Hubble’s cloud platform.The researcher also examined HTTP-based communication and how the app’s local API operated. Westergren was able to use local API commands to find GET and SET lists, as well as “value” parameters that would accept user input, “potentially leading to RCE if not properly sanitized,” he explained.Timezone hackWestergren then created a reboot shell injection payload and performed the ‘set_city_timezone’ action in the device, forcing an immediate restart and obtaining shell access in the process.In addition, the researcher also came across a bug in the implementation of the IoT messaging standard MQTT. Westergren found that the client was configured to subscribe to #and $SYS/# by default, which reduced access control security levels among Hubble devices.“A number of command[s] result from various devices,” the researcher noted. “Though I did not attempt this, I think it was very likely that a client could easily control the entire device fleet by publishing arbitrary commands.”While the product appears under the Motorola Mobility brand, its manufacturing unit was acquired in 2014 by Lenovo.Westergren said that once the initial report was made to Lenovo’s security team on April 9, they were quick to respond. By April 16, Lenovo had confirmed the issues and work on security fixes was underway. Lenovo told The Daily Swig that Binatone is the official Motorola licensee for the Motorola Halo+ and was therefore responsible for creating and rolling out patches.Halo slipsThe first set of patches were incomplete, said Westergren. He added that Lenovo warned of further delays, as “we have opened additional requirements to our licensee [Binatone] for this product to resolve this issue, which has added some complexity”.Both the RCE and MQTT problems have now been patched, in firmware versions 03.50.06 and 03.50.14, respectively.The baby monitor’s RCE vulnerability has been assigned as CVE-2021-3577, whereas the MQTT credentials issue is now tracked as CVE-2021-3787.This article was updated on September 16 to clarify that Binatone, not Lenovo, was responsible for creating and rolling out security patches for the Motorola Halo+.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Credential leak fears raised following security breach at Travis CI",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/remote-code-execution-flaw-allowed-hijack-of-motorola-halo-baby-monitors,"['IoT', 'Hardware', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Development', 'RCE', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Privacy', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Supply chain attacks against the open source ecosystem soar by 650% – report,Dependency confusion has quickly become the attack technique of choice,"The last year has seen a massive rise in the number of software supply chain attacks aimed at upstream public repositories, a new report has revealed.According to Sonatype’s annual State of the Software Supply Chain Report, such attacks numbered more than 12,000 – a 650% rise on 2020, which itself revealed a 430% increase on 2019.‘Dependency confusion’ attacks have quickly become the most common form of attack after the technique emerged in February, the report finds.BACKGROUND Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowWhile software supply chain exploits have tended in the past to exploit publicly-disclosed open source vulnerabilities left unpatched in the wild, the new breed of upstream attacka is more sinister, says Sonatype.Instead of passively waiting for vulnerability disclosures, many attackers are proactively injecting new vulnerabilities into open source projects that feed the global supply chain, and then exploiting the vulnerabilities they’ve created.Popular versus unpopular projectsSonatype, a DevSecOps automation specialist, also found that nearly three in 10 of the most popular Java, JavaScript, Python, and .NET projects contain at least one known security vulnerability, compared with just 6.5% of comparatively seldom used projects.However, the most widely used projects are more likely to have effective remediation processes in place, according to Matt Howard, SVP and CMO of Sonatype.“While more popular projects have more known vulnerabilities overall, developers using them are also less likely to be stuck in a situation where there is a known vulnerability but no remediation path,” he tells The Daily Swig.“This implies that leveraging popular projects can be a great option, but only if you can actively manage these dependencies and ensure you are moving to newer and non-vulnerable versions in a timely manner.”Self-delusionWorryingly, the report revealed a disconnect between reality and perception where security is concerned. While development teams believe they are doing a good job fixing defective components and think they understand where risk resides, the objective data tells a different story, argues Sonatype. In fact, says the report, they make suboptimal decisions 69% of the time when updating third-party dependencies.Read more of the latest open source software security news“When we compare those answers to the objective analysis we did around 100,000 applications, it’s clear the majority of development teams are not actively practicing the type of hygiene indicated in the survey responses,” says Howard.“Objectively, the research shows that most development teams are not following structured guidance with regard to dependency management and, as a result, they are not actively remediating known risk within their software supply chains.”Automating away errorsSonatype believes that automation could be the answer. Equipped with intelligent automation, it says, a medium-sized enterprise with 20 application development teams would save a total of 160 developer days a year, representing $192,000.“The cost of performing suboptimal upgrades to a single component, for a single team, for a single application is small,” says Howard. “However, when considering the fact that only 31% of upgrade decisions examined in our study were optimal, it is easy to see how much time and effort developers could save by consistently making better upgrade decisions.”The importance of getting these decisions right was underlined last week when GitHub identified several high-severity vulnerabilities in Node.js packages tar and @npmcli/arborist, which could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.The last year has seen several high-profile software supply chain attacks, including the SolarWinds hack that affected several US government agencies, Microsoft, and FireEye, among other organizations, and the ransomware attack that encrypted the data of more than 1,000 Kaseya VSA customers.Correction: This article originally stated, incorrectly, that 18,000 organizations were affected by the SolarWinds attack. In fact, around 18,000 organizations downloaded the vulnerable software, but a much smaller number were actually targeted by attackers.

no,Credential leak fears raised following security breach at Travis CI,DevOps firm slammed for ‘abysmal’ incident response,"Concern is growing within the infosec community that a breach at DevOps platform vendor Travis CI might run deeper than the firm has so far been prepared to admit.Travis CI, a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service for cloud platform projects, admitted to an issue in a post on its community forums while also downplaying its significance:According to a received report, a public repository forked from another one could file a pull request (standard functionality e.g in GitHub, BitBucket, Assembla) and while doing it, obtain unauthorized access to secret from the original public repository with a condition of printing some of the flies during the build process. In this scenario secrets are still encrypted in the Travis CI database.The issue is valid only for public repositories not private repositories. (In case of private repository, repository owner has a full control on ability of someone to fork the repository.)The vendor said that it has resolved the underlying problem with a series of security patches, adding that users should consider making changes to their pass codes and authentication tokens as a precaution.Security researcher Péter Szilágyi, team leader at Etherium, slammed Travis CI for dismissing a security breach that posed a supply chain poisoning risk to enterprises that used the vendor in their software development process.“Between Sept 3 and Sept 10, secure env vars of *all* public @travisci repositories were injected into PR [pull request] builds,” Szilágyi said in a thread on Twitter. “Signing keys, access creds, API tokens. Anyone could exfiltrate these and gain lateral movement into 1000s of orgs.“Felix Lange found this on the 7th and we’ve notified @travisci within the hour. Their only response being ‘Oops, please rotate the keys’, ignoring that *all* their infra[structure] was leaking.”Read more of the latest news about data breachesSzilágyi further criticised Travis CI for its failure to acknowledge reports of vulnerabilities to its systems or to follow incident response best practices. “No analysis, no security report, no post-mortem, not warning any of their users that their secrets might have been stolen,” he concluded.Their poor handling of the problem ought to prompt its enterprise users to consider migrating away from Travis CI, Szilágyi advised.Infosec specialist Jake Williams agreed that Travis CI was guilty of an “abysmal failure in handling an extremely serious vulnerability”.GarbageTravis CI is yet to respond to multiple requests from The Daily Swig to respond to these criticisms.Even less critical third party observers noted that users attempting to follow Travis CI’s advice would likely run into practical difficulties.“The fact that @travisci posted this without a straightforward way to see which of your repos are (1) public and (2) have build secrets is garbage,” said yan, a security engineer working on the privacy-focused Brave browser.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Critical encryption vulnerability found in secure communications platform Matrix",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/credential-leak-fears-raised-following-security-breach-at-travis-ci,"['DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Germany', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Authentication', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Organizations']"
no,Speer review: Researchers pick apart Node.js communication app,Email content injection flaws chained to bypass security controls,"A potentially troublesome set of web security vulnerabilities in Speer were promptly resolved after the researcher who unearthed the flaws notified its developer.Speer is an open source, privacy-focused communication application for Node.js. It can be used to make either audio or video calls or to send large files.Researcher François Renaud-Philippon decided to examine the source code of the app as a side project during his free time.Catch up on the latest secure development newsThe Canadian recognized a pattern of code in the app that was similar to a vulnerability they had encountered during their professional life.Sure enough, further examination revealed security shortcomings that might be combined and abused to either bypass authentication mechanisms or used as part of phishing attacks.Renaud-Philippon told The Daily Swig:The vulnerability would allow the adversary to replace the content of address validation email with anything. It could be used for phishing, or sending insensitive content.It's like webpage defacement for emails. [It could also be used to] bypass the address validation process by combining the email content injection and a template injection to exfiltrate the secret that is sent by email to check the ownership.The researcher added that Speer’s developer responded to his finding with admirable grace, releasing a security patch the next day with a patch on September 9.“They applied the patch in production,” according to Renaud-Philippon. “From my understanding no users were affected.”The release of a security update allowed Renaud-Philippon to publish a blog post documenting his discovery of the ‘email content injection’ and ‘template injection’ flaws.Speer-phishingThe chained exploit developed by the researcher involved creating an account with the intended victim’s email address and a tracking pixel in the username.When Speer sends a confirmation email to a victim, this tracking pixel results in the registration secret being leaked to an attacker who can confirm the account.The “template injection” terminology used here is perhaps open for debate, and some might say that the security shortcomings described by Renaud-Philippon might better be described as “HTML injection in email” or “email HTML injection”.Quibbles about semantics aside, the researcher concludes his findings offer lessons for both app developers and hackers about a somewhat overlooked class of vulnerability.“Email content Injections are seen as a poor man’s defacing,” according to Renaud-Philippon. “For a lot of hackers, email content injections are boring and their impact is unimpressive”.“Where email content injections shine as a vulnerability is how they can be chained to bypass security controls,” they concluded.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE VMware denies allegations it leaked Confluence RCE exploit",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/speer-review-researchers-pick-apart-node-js-communication-app,"['Authentication', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Node.js', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Email', 'Security', 'Phishing', 'Research', 'Canada', 'North', 'America', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Network', 'Security', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Privacy']"

no,VMware denies allegations it leaked Confluence RCE exploit,‘Identical’ payload removed from GitHub after researcher’s complaints,"UPDATED VMware has refuted accusations it leaked an exploit for a critical vulnerability in Confluence that independent security researchers had fashioned for its servers.In a blog post published on September 7, researcher Thanh Nguyen alleged that a payload had surfaced on GitHub that was “identical” to a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) exploit he had sent to the virtualization and cloud specialist 17 hours earlier.Nguyen pointed out that “no PoC [proof of concept] was public on the internet at this time”.BACKGROUND Jenkins project succumbs to ‘mass exploitation’ of critical Atlassian Confluence vulnerabilityThat the original payload was specifically crafted for a VMWare endpoint (confluence.eng.vmware.com) supported their “belief that it was leaked from VMWare”, he argued.VMWare told The Daily Swig it had “found no evidence that VMware leaked the exploit publicly”.Timeline of an alleged leakNguyen said he sent the original exploit, which bypassed VMWare’s WAF, to the enterprise tech firm, via its vulnerability disclosure program, on August 31. This was developed with the help of fellow researcher ‘Janggggg’.The supposed duplicate payload appeared on the Nuclei project within a pull request for CVE-2021–26084, which Atlassian, the developer of Confluence, has patched and which has been the target of widespread exploitation attempts.Nuclei’s maintainer removed the exploit after Nguyen and Janggggg queried its provenance, said Nguyen.The researcher who posted the contentious payload on Nuclei, ‘Dhiyaneshwaran’, told The Daily Swig: “I didn’t create the exploit. I just discovered [a] HTTP Request related [to] this exploit via Pastebin scraping.”They added: “My tool doesn't keep track of the source URL.”However, Nguyen told The Daily Swig: “Dhiyaneshwara’s answer on finding the leaked payload via OSINT is not really convincing to me. We have contacted and asked Dhiyaneshwara to provide us the source of information (link) on Sept 1st, 2021 right after we saw his PR on Nuclei’s GitHub but he could not provide anything [so far].” Catch up on the latest vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) newsIn response to an email from Nguyen and Janggggg, VMWare’s security team wrote: “As per our policy we do not disclose any reported vulnerability to VMWare and neither do we disclose exploit, payload attack vector, etc.”Citing a third exploit for the same Confluence bug published by Rahul Maini and Harsh Jaiswal, they added: “We have observed that the exploit was made public by other security researchers and VMWare has not made it public.”However, Nguyen dismissed the relevance of Maini and Jaiswal’s write-up because the payload differed, and it was published a few hours after the Nuclei pull request surfaced.‘Very clear to us’“As the exploit payload we sent to VMWare was specifically crafted for their server and we did not use this payload on any other target and/or sending it to any other companies/bug bounty programs, it’s very clear to us that our payload somehow was leaked from VMWare to the Nuclei project,” said Nguyen.“The exploit we sent to VMWare is our copyright property and we did not grant VMWare the right to re-distribute it,” he continued, adding that VMWare had stopped replying to his emails.A VMware spokesperson told The Daily Swig:“VMware values our relationship with the researcher community because their contributions help us protect our customers and improve our products. We also work hard to maintain researcher confidence in our bug bounty program by adhering to generally accepted protocol and acting in good faith when exploits are reported to us.“In this case we informed the researcher that we found no evidence that VMware leaked the exploit publicly. Building trust in our bounty program is important to us, and we continue to review our processes for opportunities to improve.”Nguyen responded to VMWare’s statement, saying: “IMHO, there could be a dozen of VMWare security engineers who received our report so VMWare cannot just simply deny the leak without a proper explanation on how they investigated the issue.”This article was updated on September 12 with comments from Thanh Nguyen.RECOMMENDED Spook.js – New side-channel attack can bypass Google Chrome’s protections against Spectre-style exploits",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vmware-denies-allegations-it-leaked-confluence-rce-exploit,"['VDP', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Industry', 'News', 'Research', 'Legal', 'Authentication', 'Compliance', 'Fraud', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'WAF', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'RCE', 'Vietnam', 'Asia', 'GitHub', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Zero-day', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Cloud', 'Security']"

yes,Spook.js – New side-channel attack can bypass Google Chrome’s protections against Spectre-style exploits,"CPU-level data leak technique still kicking, three years on","A newly discovered side-channel attack targeting Google Chrome can allow an attacker to overcome the web browser’s security defenses to retrieve sensitive information using a Spectre-style attack.Dubbed Spook.js, the ‘transient execution side-channel attack’ can bypass Chrome’s protections against speculative execution (Spectre) exploits to steal credentials, personal data, and more.This is according to the authors of a paper titled ‘Spook.js: Attacking Chrome Strict Site Isolation via Speculative Execution’ (PDF).Spectre attacksSpectre, which hit global headlines back in 2018, exploits flaws in the optimization features of modern CPUs to bypass the security mechanisms that prevent different processes from accessing each other’s memory space.This allowed a wide range of attacks against different types of applications, including web apps, enabling attackers to steal sensitive information across different websites by exploiting how different applications and processes interact with processors and on-chip memory.ANALYSIS Spectre attacks against websites still a serious threat, Google warnsBrowser vendors have since deployed various countermeasures in order to make Spectre-style attacks harder to exploit.Google Chrome introduced Strict Site Isolation, which prevents different webpages from sharing the same process. It also partitioned the address space of each process into different 32-bit sandboxes (despite being a 64-bit application).By limiting all values to be 32-bit, this aims to prevent a Spectre attacker from being able to cross partition boundaries, further limiting information exposure the researchers explained.No longer in isolationDespite these protections being in place, researchers from the University of Michigan, University of Adelaide, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Tel Aviv University, said that Spook.js “shows that these countermeasures are insufficient in order to protect users from browser-based speculative execution attacks”.They wrote: “More specifically, we show that Chrome’s Strict Site Isolation implementation consolidates webpages based on their eTLD+1 domain, allowing an attacker-controlled page to extract sensitive information from pages on other subdomains.“Next, we also show how to bypass Chrome’s 32-bit sandboxing mechanism. We achieve this by using a type confusion attack, which temporarily forces Chrome’s JavaScript engine to operate on an object of the wrong type.“Using this method we can combine multiple 32-bit values into a single 64-bit pointer, which allows us to read the process’s entire address space.“Finally, going beyond initial proof-of-concepts, we demonstrate end-to-end attacks extracting sensitive information such as the list of open pages, their contents, and even login credentials.”Proof-of-conceptThe team of researchers demonstrated how the attack can be used to takeover a Tumblr account by attacking Chrome’s built-in credential manager and stealing the user credentials.They also showed how Spook.js can recover the master password in the LastPass Chrome extension – allowing them access to all of the stored credentials in a user’s password vault:In addition to usernames and passwords, the researchers were able to gain access to a number of sensitive datasets that are stored in the memory of a website being rendered in Chrome browser or a Chrome extension.The researchers said they could access the list of same-site tabs which a user currently has open, phone numbers, addresses, and bank account information displayed on a website, usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers auto-filled by credential managers, and under certain circumstances, images in Google Photos which a user is currently viewing.The attack is not just limited to Google Chrome. It is also successful on other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Brave.In response, Google has introduced Strict Extension Isolation, a feature which prevents multiple extensions from being consolidated into the same process under memory pressure, stopping Spook.js from being able to read the memory of other extensions.Strict Extension Isolation is enabled as of Chrome versions 92 and up.Read more of the latest news about security vulnerabilitiesThe researchers also advised: “Web developers can immediately separate untrusted, user-supplied JavaScript code from all other content for their website, hosting all user-supplied JavaScript code at a domain that has a different eTLD+1.“This way, Strict Site Isolation will not consolidate attacker-supplied code with potentially sensitive data into the same process, putting the data out of reach even for Spook.js as it cannot cross process boundaries.“In addition, sites can register their domain name to the Public Suffix List (PSL). The PSL is maintained by Mozilla, and is a list of domains under which users can register names directly (even if the domains are not true top-level domains).“Chrome will not consolidate pages if their eTLD+1 domain is present in the PSL. That is, x.publicsuffix.com and y.publicsuffix.com will always be separated.”Spook.js mitigation adviceWhen asked how users can protect against Spook.js, Jason Kim of the Georgia Institute of Technology, told The Daily Swig: “In response to our attack, Google has deployed Strict Extension Isolation, which ensures that multiple extensions do not get consolidated into one Chrome process.“Thus, by upgrading to Chrome 92 uses can protect themselves against one version of our attack. However, due to the logic that Strict Site Isolation uses to determine if sites should be separated or not, some variants of Spook.js might still be possible.”Kim added: “For these cases, the deployment of countermeasures must be done by website administrators and web developers, and not by individual users. Luckily, Spook.js requires substantial side-channel expertise in order to use effectively, thus raising the bar for would-be attackers.”FROM THE ARCHIVES Meltdown and Spectre, one year on: Feared CPU slowdown never really materialized",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/spook-js-new-side-channel-attack-can-bypass-google-chromes-protections-against-spectre-style-exploits,"['Side-channel', 'Google', 'Browsers', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Chrome', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Research', 'JavaScript', 'Passwords', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'Australia', 'North', 'America', 'Oceania', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Mozilla', 'Privacy']"
no,OWASP shakes up web app threat categories with release of draft Top 10,The Top 10 list is a widely used guide to modern web application security threats,"The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has published its draft Top 10 2021 list revealing a shake-up of how modern threats are categorized.In an announcement yesterday (September 8), OWASP said the draft Top 10 web application security threats for 2021 has been published for the purposes of “peer review, comment, translation, and suggestions for improvements”.The draft report, available to view online, contains important changes to how the non-profit categorizes today’s web app threats, which have not been refreshed since 2017.State of play: OWASP Top 10 changes in 2021 (draft edition)Digging into the draft Top 10There are three new categories: ‘Insecure Design’, ‘Software and Data Integrity Failures’, and a group for ‘Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)’ attacks.2017’s ‘XML External Entities (XXE)’ section has been added to 2021’s Security Misconfiguration category, ‘Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)’ has been added to the ‘Injection’ section, and ‘Insecure Deserialization’ is now part of ‘Software and Data Integrity Failures’.OWASP has also renamed several categories to match scoping changes.Read more of the latest security vulnerability news and analysisWhen the organization analyzes threat intel, provided by cybersecurity firms, there are specific data factors that are used to generate the Top 10 list. These include software and hardware Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) mapping, the percentage of apps vulnerable to a particular CWE, and their coverage in organizations.OWASP also considers the weighted exploit and average metrics of a vulnerability, based on CVSSv2 and CVSSv3 scores, and the total number of apps found to have CWEs mapped to a category, as well as total CVE numbers attributable to a particular type of threat.OWASP Top 10: The full list1.A01:2021-Broken Access Control: 34 CWEs. Access control vulnerabilities include privilege escalation, malicious URL modification, access control bypass, CORS misconfiguration, and tampering with primary keys.2.A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures: 29 CWEs. This includes security failures when data is in transit or at rest, such as the implementation of weak cryptographic algorithms, poor or lax key generation, a failure to implement encryption or to verify certificates, and the transmission of data in cleartext.3.A03:2021-Injection: 33 CWEs. Common injections impact SQL, NoSQL, OS command, and LDAP, and may be caused by sanitization failures, XSS vulnerabilities, and a lack of protection for file paths.4.A04:2021-Insecure Design: 40 CWEs. Insecure design elements vary widely, but are generally described by OWASP as “missing or ineffective control design”. Areas of concern include a lack of protection for stored data, logic programming problems, and displaying content that reveals sensitive information.5.A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration: 20 CWEs. Applications may be considered vulnerable if they lack security hardening, if there are unnecessary features – such as a too-open hand when it comes to privileges – if default accounts are kept active, and if security features are not configured correctly.6.A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components: Three CWEs. This category focuses on client and server-side components, failures to maintain components, out-of-date support systems – such as an OS, web servers, or libraries – as well as component misconfiguration.7.A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures: 22 CWEs. Security issues include improper authentication, session fixation, certificate mismatches, permitting weak credentials, and a lack of protection against brute-force attacks.8.A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures: 10 CWEs. Integrity is the focal point of this category, and any failure to do so properly – such as the deserialization of untrusted data, or not checking code and updates when pulled from a remote source – may be in scope.9.A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Four CWEs. Issues that can hamper the analysis of a data breach or other form of attack, including logging problems, failing to record security-relevant information feeds, or only logging data locally come under this category.10.A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery: One CWE. SSRF vulnerabilities occur when a server does not validate user-submitted URLs when they fetch remote resources. OWASP says that the adoption of cloud services and increasingly complex architectures have ramped up the severity of SSRF attacks.Analysis: OWASP shifts left“The additions of ‘Insecure Design’ and ‘Software and Data Integrity Failures’ show how the entire software industry is continuing to ‘shift left’ by putting more focus on secure design and architecture as well as threat modeling,” Tom Eston, practice director of application security at Bishop Fox told The Daily Swig.“Often, secure design and threat modeling get overlooked because of the speed of modern development. It’s also great to finally see OWASP calling out software integrity and the security of CI/CD pipelines as another focus area.”RELATED Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a ‘post-XSS world’OWASP has also updated the methodology employed in generating the Top 10 list. Eight out of 10 categories are data-driven, and two have been selected based on responses from industry surveys.“AppSec researchers take time to find new vulnerabilities and new ways to test for them,” the organization says. “It takes time to integrate these tests into tools and processes.“By the time we can reliably test a weakness at scale, years have likely passed. To balance that view, we use an industry survey to ask people on the front lines what they see as essential weaknesses that the data may not show yet.”It should be noted that once cybersecurity experts and peers have provided feedback, this list may be subject to change.Positive responsesBrain Glas, co-lead for the OWASP Top 10, told us that the draft has initially received a lot of positive responses, although he expects “a small number of vocal people that disagree with the current draft.“This is a complex industry and a complex topic, people can have a wide range of experiences and backgrounds. For some, the draft Top 10 will align with their experience and perceptions, for others it won't and I expect there [will] likely [be] some minor changes as we process feedback and polish the draft” – although this is not yet set in stone.Andrew van der Stock, executive director of OWASP, added: “In this version, we are attempting to give guidance on how folks actually use it. In the 2007 and 2017 versions, I wrote that it’s an awareness document and no more. But that’s not how folks use it.“If the OWASP Top 10 was a game, the majority of uses would be considered emergent gameplay unintended but welcomed by the authors. So this time around, we chose to say how best to use it as an informal standard and as the very start of an AppSec program.”OWASP has also thanked organizations including AppSec Labs, GitLab, Cobalt.io, HackerOne, and Veracode, among others, for contributing data connected to over 500,000 applications.The non-profit says that these contributions have amassed to “the largest and most comprehensive application security data set” so far.Alongside the draft report, a “surprise extra” will be released on September 24. OWASP hopes the next instalment will be earlier than the four years required for this release, delayed further due to Covid-19.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/owasp-shakes-up-web-app-threat-categories-with-release-of-draft-top-10,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Industry', 'News', 'Cyber-attacks', 'SSRF', 'Encryption', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'XSS', 'CSRF', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Email', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Organizations', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Privacy', 'Enterprise', 'Research', 'Cybercrime', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Zero-day', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Cryptojacking', 'Phishing', 'Malware', 'XS-Leak', 'VDP', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Coronavirus', 'Analysis', 'Deep', 'Dives']"
no,HAProxy vulnerability enables HTTP request smuggling attacks,Project maintainers patch integer overflow flaw that has various potentially damaging outcomes,"Security researchers have disclosed a HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in HAProxy, the popular open source load balancer.Users of HAProxy, which ships with most mainstream Linux distributions and is particularly geared towards use by high traffic websites, have been urged to update their systems.RECOMMENDED Black Hat USA: HTTP/2 flaws expose organizations to fresh wave of request smuggling attacksResearchers at DevOps platform JFrog demonstrated how an integer overflow flaw (CVE-2021-40346) can be abused to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks that bypass any access control lists (ACLs) defined in HAProxy.Contingent on front- and back-end server configurations, attacks could also potentially see adversaries hijack user sessions, access or modify sensitive data, or exploit reflected XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerabilities without user interaction, according to JFrog.HTTP request smuggling explainedHTTP request smuggling, which first emerged in 2005, interferes with how websites process sequences of HTTP requests received from users.Load balancers (aka reverse proxies) typically forward multiple HTTP requests, consecutively, to back-end servers over the same network connection.If front- and back-end servers disagree about the boundaries separating requests then they can also interpret malicious, ambiguous requests divergently – with potentially devastating results.Smuggling via integer overflowThe technique is typically executed by “supplying both the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers with contradicting lengths in the same request and aiming for parsing inconsistencies between the frontend and backend servers,” reads a blog post penned by Ori Hollander and Or Peles of JFrog-owned software security automation platform Vdoo.“In our case, however, the attack was made possible by utilizing an integer overflow vulnerability that allowed reaching an unexpected state in HAProxy while parsing an HTTP request – specifically – in the logic that deals with Content-Length headers.”HTTP request smuggling with HAProxyPreceded by an explanation of HAProxy’s twin phases for handling HTTP request logic, the researchers’ detailed a bypass of security controls in which “HAProxy is only aware of a single HTTP request being forwarded and thus only returns a single HTTP response (the first) from the backend server back to the client”.Subsequently they explained how to also receive the HTTP response for the smuggled request by sending two consecutive requests.The research duo then outlined a potential means of automating discovery of the flaw and similar integer overflow vulnerabilities.Updates and workaroundThe vulnerability was fixed in HAProxy versions 2.0.25, 2.2.17, 2.3.14, and 2.4.4 by adding size checks for the name and value lengths.Hollander and Peles provided a workaround for users unable to immediately apply updates that reconfigures HAProxy in such a way that “should mitigate all variants of this attack that we’ve encountered”.Request smuggling revitalizedThe venerable request smuggling technique was developed further last month when James Kettle, head of research at PortSwigger Web Security (The Daily Swig’s parent company) showcased his exploits targeting HTTP/2 infrastructure at Black Hat USA 2021.Kettle, whose 2019 Black Hat presentation also focused on HTTP request smuggling, fashioned desynchronization attacks that saw him steal secrets from websites running Amazon’s Application Load Balancer, poison every page on Bitbucket, and force Atlassian to universally sign users out of Jira.Catch up on the latest hacking techniquesA novel alternative to HTTP request smuggling was recognized as 2020’s top web hacking technique by Kettle’s employer.Unveiled by Bishop Fox researchers in September, HTTP/2 cleartext (H2C) smuggling “abuses H2C-unaware front-ends to create a tunnel to backend systems, enabling attackers to bypass frontend rewrite rules and exploit internal HTTP headers,” said Kettle in summarizing the winning entry’s impact.Attendees at Black Hat 2020, meanwhile, were treated to a quartet of novel variants of HTTP request smuggling attacks by Amit Klein, vice president of security research at SafeBreach.RELATED HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in Apache Tomcat ‘has been present since 2015’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/haproxy-vulnerability-enables-http-request-smuggling-attacks,"['Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Amazon', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Authentication', 'XSS', 'Black', 'Hat', 'Events', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Privacy']"
no,One in five IceWarp mail servers still vulnerable to pre-pandemic security flaw,"Vendor agrees that XSS bug poses a grave risk, but warns it ‘can’t force users to upgrade’","Tens of thousands of IceWarp mail server systems remain vulnerable to a troublesome web security vulnerability – despite the fact that the issue was patched last year.Lütfü Mert Ceylan, the 16-year-old Turkish security researcher and bug hunter who discovered the vulnerability (CVE-2020-8512) back in January 2020, told The Daily Swig that more than one in five of IceWarp systems remain vulnerable to the cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw.“The vulnerability can be detected and exploited very easily” and “leads to the leak of user information”, Ceylan warned.You got XSSIceWarp is mail and collaboration server software aimed at small to mid-range businesses and as an alternative to services such as Microsoft Exchange.The XSS vulnerability in question was resolved in 11.4.4.1 of IceWarp.Earlier versions of the technology are vulnerable to a flaw that means an attacker can use an XSS loophole the /WebMail/ color parameter to send a malicious script to unsuspecting admins or users.Catch up on the latest cross-site scripting (XSS) news and analysisSearches using the Shodan IoT search engine and other tools allowed Ceylan to estimate that 21% of systems are running earlier versions of the software and are therefore vulnerable.Sending out the wordIn response to queries from The Daily Swig, the IceWarp development team agreed with Ceylan’s diagnosis of the problem, while reiterating that those affected are running unsupported versions of the technology.Antonin Pruki, CTO of Czech Republic-based IceWarp, said the vendor was encouraging customers to upgrade but ultimately it cannot force them to do an upgrade since IceWarp is installed on their own hardware and is therefore “fully under their control”.He said:IceWarp 11.4.4 was released in 2016 and we actually got first report about this particular vulnerability back in 2017.It was already addressed back then, and our customers were informed via [the] usual channels. Moreover, since that time there were two new generations of the login screen, which is now build on top of completely different stack than was the case in 2016. So even at the time when CVE-2020-8512 was published, the problem had been addressed few years ago. Last but not least, the version 11.4.4 is not officially supported any more.“There is an obvious problem however that many customers still run on version 11.4 and older,” Pruki warned.“We also tried to reach all customers again a year ago and strongly recommended them to consider an upgrade,” Pruki concluded.RECOMMENTED WordPress security: information leak flaw addressed in Ninja FormsReacting to these comments, Ceylan told The Daily Swig that there may be practical reasons as to why some users have delayed upgrading their systems, aside from general tardiness.It is true that IceWarp creates new login structures, but when I reviewed the CVEs reported by other researchers in the past, I noticed that the vulnerabilities found in the first subversions of IceWarp 11 were not fixed with security patches in the next subversions. In other words, no action has been taken about the vulnerabilities detected in subversions (11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, and 11.4) until the release and outdated date of IceWarp 11. These security patches were mostly outdated to IceWarp 11 and added later when new versions (IceWarp 12.x etc) started to come out. That's why almost no company has implemented this patch, leaving tens of thousands of websites potentially vulnerable.IceWarp disputed this interpretation and said its release cycle was more aligned with that of Google Chrome or Adobe Acrobat Reader than Microsoft Exchange.Pruki concluded: “I fully agree with Lütfü's [Ceylan] findings, i.e the number of customers that run an outdated version of IceWarp that has this vulnerability (and also couple other vulnerabilities that were discovered and addressed later) is still too high.”MORE SECURITY RESEARCH Machine learning technique detects phishing sites based on markup visualization",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/one-in-five-icewarp-mail-servers-still-vulnerable-to-pre-pandemic-security-flaw,"['XSS', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Email', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Privacy', 'IoT']"
no,WordPress security: Information leak flaw addressed in Ninja Forms,Developer reveals error-proofing improvements after delay to rollout of rapid fix,"An information disclosure vulnerability has been patched in Ninja Forms, the form-building plugin for WordPress with more than one million active installations.An authenticated attacker who abuses the flaw could export personal data submitted to websites via forms built with the extension.The plugin’s developer, Saturday Drive, addressed the flaw in version 3.5.8, which it released yesterday (September 7) after a delay to the rollout of an otherwise seemingly rapid fix.The insecure code was introduced in version 3.5.5, according to a blog post published by WordPress security service Plugin Vulnerabilities.As well as updating their systems, Plugin Vulnerabilities recommends that website administrators running vulnerable versions who grant ‘untrusted’ individuals access to WordPress accounts could review “log files for the website to make sure there haven’t been any requests for the relevant path” to exploitation.Error proofingIt also criticized Saturday Drive for submitting a new version of the plugin to the Subversion repository underlying the WordPress Plugin Directory back on August 17, more than three weeks before releasing an official software update.A description of, and code change for, the fix were also committed publicly on the WordPress Plugin Directory that, if seen by malicious actors, made it “trivial to exploit the vulnerability,” said Plugin Vulnerabilities.Stuart Sequeira, lead engineer for Ninja Forms at Saturday Drive, responded quickly to The Daily Swig’s queries, saying that he “put in a fix” the day after security vendor Wordfence alerted them to the flaw, but admitted to an oversight that has since led them to introduce greater automation in releasing fixes.Catch up on the latest WordPress security news“I've been working on an internal process to track, remedy, and release security fixes with proper disclosure on a fast cycle,” he explained.“In this process, while we got the fix done immediately, I failed to turn it around and get it out the next day, which is what should have happened; instead it was in normal cycle.“As part of our internal process corrections to error-proof this in the future, we have implemented an automated build and release protocol such that security fixes, once we implement them, will be released almost immediately.”‘Possible leg up’Plugin Vulnerabilities also accused Wordfence, the WordPress security specialist, of “giving [malicious] hackers a possible leg up” in advance of a software update being readily available.This was because they added a rule to its Web Application Firewall (WAF), which was available to non-paying customers on September 2 and premium subscribers 30 days earlier, that revealed clues about the vulnerability’s existence and provenance.Part of the rule apparently seeks a request path containing ‘ninja-forms-submissions’ that a hacker could link to the plugin by using the website WP Directory.Wordfence has yet to respond to our queries about this, but we will update the story if and when they do so.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/wordpress-security-information-leak-flaw-addressed-in-ninja-forms,"['WordPress', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DevSecOps', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Authentication', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'WAF', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,New York State vaccine pass shortcomings offer lessons for other coronavirus app developers,‘Incomplete threat modelling’ blamed for credential forgery vulnerability,"A mobile app developed by New York State to store records of Covid-19 vaccinations was vulnerable to credential forgery, security researchers at NCC Group have discovered.The New York State (NYS) Excelsior Pass Vaccine Passport credential forgery bug arose because of “incomplete threat modelling and consideration of where and how the systems could be abused rather than a technical limitation”, NCC researcher Siddarth Adukia told The Daily Swig.More specifically, the NYS Excelsior Scanner app verified credentials correctly, but the Wallet app did not validate these credentials until a recently developed fix was released.This was a problem because “some venues don’t use the Scanner app or ignore the verification results and trust the seemingly legitimate data on a user’s device, leaving the technology open to abuse”, NCC warned.Proof-of-vaccine forgeryThe researchers discovered that someone could potentially use the security flaw to access venues that require proof of Covid-19 vaccination without having had any jabs by using forged credentials added to a mobile wallet app.An August 20 software update, prompted by NCC’s research, guards against this trickery.Catch up on the latest coronavirus security news and analysisLeisure and hospitality venues in New York have a responsibility to check credentials, as documentation of the NYS Excelsior Pass website explains.“It is critical that venues use the Scanner app to validate vaccine credentials,” Adukia explained.“Locking the Wallet application down to prevent the storage of fake credentials makes it harder for someone to present them convincingly, but venues could just as easily accept fake paper vaccination cards if they are not diligent.”The researcher added: “It’s a fine line between making the technology hard to abuse, and using it correctly.”Trust, but verifyNCC came across the issue during a wider study into Covid-19 ‘vaccine passport’ applications.“We wanted to gauge the extent to which a user’s privacy would be affected by using them, and the degree of trust that they should place on digital vaccine credential systems as a result,” Adukia, a technical director at NCC Group explained.RECOMMENDED Jenkins project succumbs to ‘mass exploitation’ of critical Atlassian Confluence vulnerabilityNCC published a technical advisory into its research on the NYS Excelsior Pass in a detailed technical advisory last week.Lessons learnedAdukia argued that the findings offered lessons that others in the process of rolling out vaccine pass systems should bear in mind.“All developers of vaccine credential systems should consider how this technology could be subverted on a social level, before taking proactive steps to curb such actions and make it harder to abuse the system,” the researcher said.“This could involve threat modelling how the apps are used, their technical and non-technical aspects, and education for the individuals and venues that use the app.“It should also involve collecting and using the least amount of data required and other data minimisation principles where possible.”RELATED French government visa website hit by cyber-attack that exposed applicants’ personal data",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/new-york-state-vaccine-pass-shortcomings-offer-lessons-for-other-coronavirus-app-developers,"['US', 'Mobile', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'North', 'America', 'Authentication', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Government', 'Coronavirus', 'Privacy', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Retail', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Compliance', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Cloud', 'Security']"
no,Machine learning technique detects phishing sites based on markup visualization,Researchers showcase new method for improving the detection of fake websites,"Machine learning models trained on the visual representation of website code can help improve the accuracy and speed of detecting phishing websites.This is according to a paper (PDF) by security researchers at the University of Plymouth and the University of Portsmouth, UK.The researchers aim to address the shortcomings of existing detection methods, which are either too slow or not accurate enough.Turning web code into imagesThe technique developed by the researchers uses “binary visualization” libraries to transform the markup and code of web pages into images.Using this method, they created a dataset of legitimate and phishing images of websites.Visual differences between the legitimate PayPal login page and a phishing equivalentThe dataset was then used to train a machine learning model to classify legitimate and phishing websites based on the differences in their binary visualization.To test a new website, the target webpage’s code is transformed through binary visualization and run through the trained model.Read more of the latest phishing newsTo speed up the model’s performance, the researchers used MobileNet, a neural network that has been optimized to run on resource-constrained devices as opposed to cloud servers. The system also gradually builds up a database of legitimate and phishing websites to avoid excessive and unnecessary inferences.Overview of the proposed approachAccurate detection of phishing websitesAccording to the researchers’ experiments, the model reached 94% accuracy in detecting phishing websites. And since it uses a very small neural network, it can run on user devices and provide near-real-time results.“We have tested the technique with actual phishing and legit sites,” Stavros Shiaeles, one of the paper’s co-authors, told The Daily Swig.This is not the first time that binary visualization and machine learning has been used in cybersecurity. In 2019, Shiaeles, who is a cybersecurity lecturer at the University of Portsmouth, was among the co-authors of another technique that used ML and binary visualization to detect malware with promising results.After testing the phishing website detection system, the team is now taking the next step to make the technique ready for adoption.“We are working on a new extended method and we are trying to apply for a patent,” Shiaeles said. “Based on the results we initially have I don't see the point not to be adopted.

no,Jenkins project succumbs to ‘mass exploitation’ of critical Atlassian Confluence vulnerability,Thousands of instances still vulnerable to Apache Struts-like flaw,"UPDATED The Jenkins project says it has fallen prey to widespread attacks targeting a critical vulnerability in Confluence, Atlassian’s team collaboration software.Attackers compromised Jenkins’ deprecated Confluence service last week, revealed the team behind the eponymous open source automation server on September 4.“We responded immediately by taking the affected server offline while we investigated the potential impact,” the Jenkins team said in a blog post.“At this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected.”Patches ‘cannot wait’Attackers abused an Open Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection flaw – the same vulnerability type involved in the notorious 2017 Equifax hack – capable of leading to remote code execution (RCE) in Confluence Server and Data Center instances.Rated CVSS 9.8, the bug (CVE-2021-26084) was disclosed in a Confluence security advisory published on August 25.RELATED VMware denies allegations it leaked Confluence RCE exploit With exploit proof-of-concepts circulating, US CyberCOM underlined the urgency of updating vulnerable systems in a tweet issued on September 3, ahead of the US Labor Day holiday weekend.“Mass exploitation of Atlassian Confluence CVE-2021-26084 is ongoing and expected to accelerate,” the agency warned. “Please patch immediately if you haven’t already – this cannot wait until after the weekend.”In a blog post tracking the issue, infosec firm Censys revealed how many customers were heeding such warnings, observing a drop in the number of vulnerable Confluence instances from 14,562 on August 25 to 8,597 on September 5.Road to RCEAfter finally having his disclosure request approved, security researcher Benny Jacob shared a write-up of the flaw, which he discovered, on October 5.“When a Webwork tag with a Value attribute that has a $ is encountered an initial evaluation happens in the parsing of Velocity template,” he explains in a GitHub post.“This evaluated value is then passed to the Webwork tag which further evaluates the value as an OGNL expression.“If the action class exposes a setter function for the parameter used in the value attribute then this parameter can be set from the URL by using URL params. So by crafting a URL with an OGNL payload an attacker can perform remote code execution.”There has previously been controversy over another proof-of-concept for the vulnerability, with VMware refuting accusations that it had leaked an exploit that independent security researchers had specifically crafted for one of their endpoints.Monero minerThe Jenkins Project said attackers managed to install what it believed was a Monero miner in a container running an affected Confluence instance.However, “from there an attacker would not be able to access much of our other infrastructure”, it said.Nevertheless, Jenkins is “assuming the worst” and halting releases “until we re-establish a chain of trust with our developer community”.RECOMMENDED Russian retailer issues DEXP phone recall following security auditAlthough Jenkins said there was no indication that developer credentials were stolen during the attack, it has applied a universal password reset to its integrated identity system, with which Confluence is integrated.The compromised Confluence service, which was switched to read-only mode in 2019 as Jenkins began migrating documentation and changelogs to GitHub repositories, has now been “permanently disabled”.Jenkins has also “rotated privileged credentials and taken proactive measures to further reduce the scope of access across our infrastructure”.The team added: “We are working closely with our colleagues at the Linux Foundation and the Continuous Delivery Foundation to ensure that infrastructure which is not directly managed by the Jenkins project is also scrutinized.”Updates and workaroundThe vulnerability was addressed in on-premise Confluence versions 6.13.23, 7.4.11, 7.11.6, 7.12.5, and 7.13.0.

no,"PoC released for Ghostscript vulnerability that exposed Airbnb, Dropbox",Server-side image conversion vector laid bare,"Hackers have released proof-of-concept code that exploits a recently demonstrated vulnerability in older but still widely used versions of Ghostscript, the popular server-side image conversion software package.Security researcher Emil Lerner demonstrated an unpatched vulnerability for Ghostscript version 9.50 at the ZeroNights X conference in Saint Petersburg, Russia last month.The finding was demonstrated using ImageMagick, a free and open source cross-platform software for file conversion, on Ubuntu.Catch up with the latest cybersecurity research newsDuring his talk, Lerner explained how he was able to leverage his discovery to hack into the systems of Airbnb, Dropbox, and the Yandex.Realty app – collecting various bug bounties in the process.There are a couple of different techniques at play. The Airbnb exploit, for example, uses server-side request forgery (SSRF) to cause a memory dump and steal AWS metadata.??The Dropbox attack led to remote code execution (RCE) but was limited to a non-privileged user, limiting its potency. Researchers escalated the scope of their exploit by causing Python to import their script when triggering an exception.??The last exploit uses SVG (scalable vector graphics) to import itself as an EPI file, which is processed by Ghostscript and allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.Practical MagickA proof-of-concept Python script targeting the Ghostscipt vulnerability and using ImageMagick with the default settings from the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution was posted on GitHub last weekend.The Daily Swig approached Lerner, the hacker who posted the proof-of-concept script, and Artifex, the developers and marketers of Ghostscript, for comment.

no,French government visa website hit by cyber-attack that exposed applicants’ personal data,"Nationalities, birth dates, and passport numbers among potentially exposed data","UPDATED The personal data of visa applicants hoping to visit or emigrate to France has been exposed in a cyber-attack targeting the French government’s ‘France-Visas’ website.France’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of the Interior, which jointly manage the site, said the attack took place on August 10 and was “quickly neutralized”, according to a Google translation of a French-language government press release published on Friday (September 3).The compromised data comprises details entered during visa applications, including email addresses, first and last names, dates of birth, nationalities, and passport numbers or identity card numbers.No financial or ‘sensitive’ data (as defined by the GDPR) was compromised, said the government ministries.Read more of the latest security news from FranceThe press release did not disclose how many individuals are impacted or a range of dates within which visa applications were compromised.The statement intimates that the stolen data would not be sufficient for the attackers to access government services under the guise of victims.David Sygula, senior cybersecurity analyst at Paris-headquartered infosec firm CybelAngel, told The Daily Swig: “Such data is highly valuable like any PII for malicious purposes. Depending on the country and the freshness of data, one record can typically be sold for around 10, to several dozen euros on illicit sites (Dark Web). “The data in question can be used for impersonation to carry out several types of fraud, such as opening a bank account or other malicious activities related to immigration (think human trafficking).”Incident responseThe French government ministries said they immediately implemented measures to secure france-visas.gouv.fr and prevent further attacks.Affected individuals have been notified of the data breach and been given recommendations for protecting their personal data and online identities, said the statement.The French data protection regulator – the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL) – has been notified and a judicial investigation is underway, reads the press release.David Sygula of CybelAngel said: “The mere successes of the attack – although contained – is a way of attacking France as a country and institution. It may ‘give faith’ to other groups and harm France’s overall reputation regarding cyber exposure.”The number of visas issued by the French government fell by nearly 80% between 2019, when 3.5 million visas were granted, and 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic decimated international travel, SchengenVisaInfo.com has previously reported.The Daily Swig has asked the French government for further details, and we will update this story if and when they do so.This article was updated with comments from David Sygula of CybelAngel on September 7.RELATED Dallas Independent School District reports data breach impacting current and former students, staff",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/french-government-visa-website-hit-by-cyber-attack-that-exposed-applicants-personal-data,"['France', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Government', 'Database', 'Security', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Privacy', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Coronavirus', 'Europe', 'Industry', 'News', 'Fraud']"
no,Raider: A tool to test authentication in web applications,Open source project aims to offer ‘unlimited flexibility’ for security researchers,"A new framework designed to test authentication protocols aims to plug the gaps left by popular vulnerability scanning tools.Raider is the brainchild of start-up DigeeX Security. It is designed to test authentication mechanisms in web applications.Daniel Neagaru, who created the tool, told The Daily Swig: “The HTTP protocol is stateless, while the authentication itself is stateful. So to effectively run tests, Raider treats the process as a finite state machine.“Each state contains the HTTP request, response, and inputs/outputs associated with this information exchange.”Read more about the latest web hacking toolsWritten in Python, Raider keeps track of the client’s state and provides an interface to interact with all-important elements during authentication, including cookies, headers, and CSRF tokens.Neagaru told The Daily Swig that the configuration files are written in Hylang, a Lisp dialect on top of Python, which offers “unlimited flexibility”. Due to its architecture, users “can easily add new features without messing with the main code”, he said.Dual purposeOriginally devised to “scratch his own itches”, Neagaru said Raider can be used by both security researchers and organizations.“Researchers could write attack scenarios and reuse them on other applications they are testing,” he explained.“On the other hand, organizations could set up the configuration files, write a set of tests to run, and even integrate them into their CI/CD pipeline to ensure that authentication works as expected and that no new bugs get introduced.”Gap in the marketRaider was developed after Neagaru decided that other popular web vulnerability testing tools didn’t quite produce the results he needed.Neagaru told The Daily Swig: “Like everyone else, when testing the authentication myself, I was using classic web proxies like ZAProxy and Burp Suite. However, they don’t work well for authentication.RECOMMENDED Enfilade: Open source tool flags ransomware and bot infections in MongoDB instances“For example, if I wanted to brute-force the multi-factor authentication code, but after each wrong try, the application requires repeating the login process from the start, it gets complicated.“I believe most authentication bugs in the wild have been discovered by writing custom Python scripts specific to the application in question. With Raider, those kinds of attacks are easy to reproduce.“Also, you can reuse the working configuration files in the future to try some new attacks.”Growing interestWhile Neagaru admits that there are barriers to using the tool – namely that the user needs to know both Python and Hylang – he said there is a “growing interest” from the security community, based on their metrics.He added: “At the moment, Raider is in the process of getting approved by OWASP projects, so hopefully, soon, it will get a new home there.“The next step would be to build a community around it so that users can learn from each other and share their configurations.”YOU MAY LIKE Top Hacks from Black Hat and DEF CON 2021",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/raider-a-tool-to-test-authentication-in-web-applications,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Authentication', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevSecOps', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Organizations', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Secure', 'Development']"

Others were said to have a backdoor that forwards incoming SMS messages to an unknown server.ValdikSS says he discovered the issue while considering swapping the USB modems he used to receive SMS messages for phones, as these were cheaper and are capable of taking up to four SIM cards each.“The research begun due to unexpected behavior of the phone – it sent SMS by itself,” he tells The Daily Swig.Of the five Russian push-button phones tested, only one was said to be ‘clean’He then tested a number of push-button models, including the Inoi 101, DEXP SD2810, Itel it2160, Irbis SF63, and F+ Flip 3.And, he found, some of the phones were not only transmitting IMEI and IMSI numbers for the purposes of tracking sales, but also contained a trojan that sends SMS messages to paid short numbers, after downloading the text and number from a server via the internet.Finally, a backdoor was found that intercepts incoming SMS messages and forwards them to the server, potentially allowing an attacker to use the phone’s number to register for services that require confirmation via SMS.Read more of the latest mobile security news“I was very confused when [a] DEXP SD2160 phone tried to send premium SMS to the number and with the body loaded from its server on the internet,” he says.“The device, initially manufactured in 2019, was being sold by one of the largest electronic stores in June 2021, with lots of negative reviews in the same store’s website, and they didn’t recall it from sales.“I’ve watched it to do all the nasty stuff in real time on my GSM cell tower.”Mixed bagThe Inoi 101, the researcher says, was clean and didn’t perform any covert actions.However, the Itel it2160 model – also available outside of Russia – broadcast its sale over the internet, without warning, as did the F+ Flip 3 phone.The DEXP SD2810 did the same, while also accessing a command-and-control server on the internet and executing its commands, sending paid SMSs to short numbers with text received from the server.RECOMMENDED Zero-day flaws in IoT baby monitors could give attackers access to camera feedsAnd the Irbis SF63, says ValdikSS, is “a dangerous phone that uses your phone number for commercial purposes to register third parties with online services” like the DEXP, sending POST requests over HTTP, but also encrypting the transmitted data with its own algorithm with, apparently, a fixed key.ValdikSS said he contacted the vendors, but with little response.The Daily Swig has approached the manufacturers for comment, and will update this article as and when we hear back.RELATED ‘Stalkerware’ vendor SpyFone barred from surveillance market, FTC announces",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nasty-stuff-research-into-russian-push-button-cellphones-uncovers-legion-of-security-issues,"['Mobile', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Privacy', 'Surveillance', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Malware', 'Encryption', 'MitM', 'Authentication', 'Spyware']"

no,Node.js archives serious tar handling vulnerabilities with software update,Enter the tar pit,"Developers of Node.js have released a significant update to the technology that resolves five troublesome security vulnerabilities, including some that present a remote code execution risk.The Node.js patch batch offers relief from a total of three high-severity issues and two moderate security flaws.All involve vulnerabilities in the node-tar, arborist, and npm cli modules and relate to remediation of node-tar vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32803 and CVE-2021-32804, resolved last month.RELATED Node.js update addresses high severity HTTP request smuggling, memory corruption bugsThe NPM package ""tar"" (aka node-tar) was susceptible to an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability.Path integrity controls built into the technology came unstuck when “extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems”, as explained in an a US National Vulnerability Database (NVD) write-up of the CVE-2021-37701 vulnerability.It added:The cache checking logic used both `\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.”Similar issues could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.The same NVD alert explains: “If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.“A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created.”Keep it zippedIt’s not uncommon for websites to allow users to upload zip (archive) files and extract them, and this is why the tar vulnerability is particularly relevant for webadmins to patch.Node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. The CVE-2021-37712 vulnerability violates this control, thus creating a risk from malformed tar archives similar to the CVE-2021-37701 vulnerability.Both flaws are categorized as high-risk. The third high-risk flaw in the batch (CVE-2021-37713) creates an arbitrary file overwrite or code execution risk because of insufficient relative path sanitization, again involving node-tar.The two other vulnerabilities covered in the patch batch involve issues with the arborist and npm cli modules.

no,Mozilla offers transparency by publishing VPN audit,Non-profit reveals more favorable results than those uncovered by similar review last year,"UPDATED Mozilla has published the results of an independently conducted audit of its virtual private network (VPN) technology.The initiative – part of the Firefox developer’s efforts to offer greater transparency in its plans to improve user security and privacy – was conducted by German security outfit Cure53.The audit involved a combination of source code reviews and a penetration test, taking a ‘white box’ approach to security auditing. A team of seven from Cure53 carried out the audit over a combined period of 25 days.The review is the second on Mozilla’s technology by Cure53. The first audit happened in August 2020 and yielded several issues, including a critical-severity bug. “A lot of development work has been done since then,” Cure53 concluded.Mozilla told The Daily Swig: ""We partnered with Cure53 in 2020 to conduct an audit of the first iteration of Mozilla VPN. However, shortly after this audit, we underwent a full re-architecture to make Mozilla VPN more cross platform utilizing the Qt-framework instead of managing per platform code bases. We did issue a public advisory resulting from that report, which can be found here.""What’s in the box?This year’s exercise led to the discovery of a rare example of a cross-site web socket hijacking vulnerability.The high severity flaw meant that Mozilla VPN client, when put in debug mode, “exposes a WebSocket interface to localhost to trigger events and retrieve logs”. Since the WebSocket interface only features in pre-release test builds of the software, customers were not impacted by the issue.Cure53’s painstaking audit of Mozilla’s code on all supported platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, and Android) also uncovered two medium severity flaws in mainstream builds of the software.Check out the latest VPN security newsIn cases where the captive portal detection mechanism has been activated, Mozilla’s VPN client allows the sending of unencrypted HTTP requests outside the encrypted tunnel to certain IP addresses.Although strict disciplinarians would categorise this behaviour as a medium risk flaw, the same approach is used across industry by Firefox, Chrome, and the network manager of macOS among other applications.The captive portal detection algorithm requires a plain-text HTTP trusted endpoint to work, with captive portal detection offering benefits to users that arguably exceed the security risks.Where it’s @Another issue uncovered by the audit is more befitting of the description of a medium risk threat.This flaw means that an authentication code could be leaked because of flaws in the authentication flow in Mozilla’s technology.When a user wants to log into Mozilla VPN, the VPN client makes a request to a Mozilla site in order to obtain an authorization URL. The endpoint takes a port parameter that will be reflected in an <img> element after the user signs into the web page.Security auditors at Cure53 found that the port parameter could be of an arbitrary value.“Further, it was possible to inject the @ sign, so that the request will go to an arbitrary host instead of localhost (the site’s strict Content Security Policy prevented such requests from being sent),” according to Cure53.Mozilla resolved the issue by improving the port number parsing in the REST API component of the software.A summary on the main flaws identified during the audit can be found here. A copy of a more comprehensive report listing lower impact flaws uncovered during the review is here (PDF).Mozilla told The Daily Swig about the broad objectives of its audits, which extend beyond the Firefox VPN evaluation run by Cure53.""We conduct both internal and external security audits for many of our products,"" it said. ""The types of audits and their frequency is something we balance on a per product basis and follows a risk-based model.""""Our broad objective with these audits is to function as a strong and independent view to compliment our internal security program and our public bug bounty program,"" the Firefox developer added.The Daily Swig also invited Cure53 to comment on its audit.

Only 25 of these files were considered problematic, but some of the leaked material was said to have included exam and revision notes, as well as NCC Group training materials.The identity of those who posted the material has never been established.Read more of the latest information security industry newsIn the months following, CREST refreshed the infosec courses in question and appointed an independent board to investigate, together with the assistance of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).The probe has taken 12 months to complete.CREST has now issued a final statement on the situation, accompanied by a report (PDF), concluding that the investigation centered around two occasions, taking place between 2012 and 2014, in which “the examination-related activities of some NCC Group employees and candidates breached the CREST code of conduct and non-disclosure agreements [NDAs]”.“As their employer, NNC Group was, at the time, vicariously responsible for those individuals,” the report says.Lengthy investigationThe NDAs, likely broken in CREST’s eyes, involved an NCC Group employee talking about CREST exams and candidates creating notes based on the tests.However, CREST acknowledged that there does not appear to be any “anomalies” suggesting NCC Group students capitalized on the leaked data to their advantage.“We acknowledge that the whole investigation and review process has taken significantly longer than people would have liked,” CREST said. “It has been complex, and we have done everything we can to ensure that it has been based on high-quality evidence, thorough and fair throughout.”RECOMMENDED Cyber awareness initiative aims to close infosec workforce gap with free school curriculumIn a statement on August 26, NCC Group said the organization “fully accepts” the results of the investigation, highlighting that there was “no evidence that NCC Group knew about, condoned, or otherwise sanctioned such activity [and] there was no evidence that any NCC Group candidate gained an unfair advantage when sitting a CREST exam”.NCC added that improvements have been made to internal processes following an in-house investigation.“We further support and welcome CREST’s own improvements, which we believe will benefit all members and strengthen the value the examination process has in protecting society from the ever-increasing threat landscape,” NCC Group says.The Daily Swig has reached out to CREST for further comment and we will update when we hear back.NCC Group declined to comment further.INSIGHT Fight or flight: How one of the UK’s busiest airports defends against cyber-attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/crest-ncc-group-vicariously-responsible-for-those-involved-in-exam-controversy,"['Industry', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Education', 'Government']"
no,Eight US financial services firms given six-figure fines over BEC data breaches,Thousands of victims involved as separate report warns of wider rise in brute-force attacks against accounts,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sanctioned multiple financial services firms for cybersecurity failures that led to the compromise of corporate email accounts and the personal data of thousands of individuals.The case was brought after the unauthorized takeover of cloud-based email accounts at Seattle-based KMS Financial Services, and subsidiaries of California-headquartered Cetera Financial Group and Iowa-based Cambridge Investment Group.INSIGHT Credential stuffing attacks: How to protect your accounts from being compromisedThe Cetera entities in question are Cetera Advisor Networks, Cetera Investment Services, Cetera Financial Specialists, Cetera Advisors, and Cetera Investment Advisers.The Cambridge entities involved in the business email compromise (BEC) investigation included Cambridge Investment Research and Cambridge Investment Research Advisors.Financial penaltiesWithout admitting or denying the charges, all eight investment advisory or broker dealer firms “agreed to cease and desist from future violations of the charged provisions, to be censured and to pay a penalty”, the SEC said in a press release issued on Monday (August 30).The Cetera entities will pay $300,000, Cambridge will pay $250,000, and KMS Financial Services will pay $200,000.The email account takeovers exposed personally identifying information related to at least 4,388 Cetera customers and clients via more than 60 compromised employee accounts between November 2017 and June 2020.The data of more than 2,100 Cambridge customers and clients may have been compromised via more than 121 compromised email accounts between January 2018 and July 2021, and for KMS this was around 4,900 customers via 15 compromised email accounts between September 2018 and December 2019.Security shortcomingsThe SEC said Cetera Advisors and Cetera Investment Advisers sent breach notifications to clients that misleadingly suggested the notifications had been issued “much sooner” than was the case.It also found that Cambridge Investment Group failed to bolster the security of cloud-based email accounts after discovering the first email account takeover in January 2018.And the SEC censured KMS for failing “to adopt written policies and procedures requiring additional firm-wide security measures until May 2020”, or fully implementing them until August 2020.Read more of the latest social engineering news and attacks“Investment advisers and broker dealers must fulfill their obligations concerning the protection of customer information,” said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC enforcement division's cyber unit.“It is not enough to write a policy requiring enhanced security measures if those requirements are not implemented or are only partially implemented, especially in the face of known attacks.”Brute-force boomThe SEC sanctions coincided with related news of a spike in brute-force attacks, whereby various credential permutations are automatically and rapidly fed into targeted account login pages.According to Abnormal Security’s Q3 2021 Email Threat Report, incidences of such attacks jumped 671% week-on-week in the week beginning June 6, 2021, with 32.5% of organizations in a range of sectors subject to brute-forcing attempts.Researchers also saw a significant increase in phishing attacks designed to steal credentials, which accounted for 73% of all ‘advanced’ threats over the quarter.The report additionally found that 137 of 100,000 mailboxes belonging to company executives were taken over in the second quarter of 2021.With these socially engineered attacks readily evading “secure email gateways and other traditional email infrastructure”, Abnormal Security CEO Evan Reiser urged organizations “to comprehensively understand employee and vendor identities, their relationships, all with deep context, including content and tone to baseline good behavior”.READ MORE Microsoft Exchange Server had ‘ProxyToken’ vulnerability that leaked incoming emails",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/eight-us-financial-services-firms-given-six-figure-fines-over-bec-data-breaches,"['US', 'Email', 'Security', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Compliance', 'Legal', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Passwords', 'Privacy', 'Phishing', 'Research', 'Authentication', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'North', 'America', 'Industry', 'News']"

no,Microsoft Exchange Server had ‘ProxyToken’ vulnerability that leaked incoming emails,Patched authentication bypass comes in wake of widespread exploitation of ‘ProxyShell’ vulnerabilities,"UPDATED Microsoft has patched a fresh security vulnerability in Exchange Server that enables attackers to bypass authentication and snoop on employee emails.The high severity flaw (CVSS 7.3) means unauthenticated assailants can install a forwarding rule on victims’ mailboxes that forwards incoming emails to their own account, according to a blog post published yesterday (August 30) by Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).“Furthermore, it may be possible to use the ProxyToken bug to perform other illicit modifications to Exchange mailbox configuration,” ZDI communications manager Dustin Childs told The Daily Swig.Dubbed ‘ProxyToken’, the flaw (CVE-2021-33766) was reported to the Zero Day Initiative in March 2021 by Le Xuan Tuyen of the Information Security Center of Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT-ISC). Microsoft released a patch in July.RELATED Microsoft warns of critical Azure Cloud vulnerability impacting Cosmos DB accountsThe disclosure is the latest in a string of serious vulnerabilities to surface in the market-leading enterprise mail server and follows a recent barrage of attacks targeting systems unpatched against ‘ProxyShell’ vulnerabilities.Security researchers at Huntress Labs have found LockFile ransomware payloads and more than 200 hidden webshells among more than 4,000 Exchange servers since the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) urged users to update their systems on August 21.Authentication delegationThe latest vulnerability relates to the ‘Delegated Authentication’ mechanism and impacts deployments in their default configuration.Delegated Authentication means Microsoft Exchange’s front-end client for Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange Control Panel (ECP) delegates the authentication of requests within /ecp to the back end if it finds a non-empty cookie named SecurityToken.Le Xuan Tuyen found that, in installations not configured to use Delegated Authentication, “a <remove> element appears” in the /ecp/web.config on the back end, “so that the module DelegatedAuthModule will not be loaded at all for the back-end ECP site”, explained ZDI security researcher Simon Zuckerbraun.Catch up on the latest email security news“The net result is that requests can sail through, without being subjected to authentication on either the front or back end,” said Zuckerbraun.The exploit requires that attackers have an account on the target Exchange Server – except for installations where administrators have permitted “forwarding rules with arbitrary internet destinations”, he added.“Furthermore, since the entire /ecp site is potentially affected, various other means of exploitation may be available as well,” he added.Although Dustin Childs notes that Microsoft has deemed the risk of exploitation as relatively unlikely, he says the ZDI has “a working proof of concept, so it would not surprise us to see this used in the wild in the near future”.Microsoft apparently addressed the vulnerability in April but didn’t document it until the July release. “Silent patches have caused many problems in the past and represent significant risks to enterprises,” said Childs. “While the goal should be for administrators to install every patch, this is simply not feasible for most networks. Network defenders need as much information as possible to prioritize their resources.”A Microsoft spokesperson told The Daily Swig: “A security update was released in July. Customers who apply the update, or have automatic updates enabled, will be protected.” ‘Amazingly fertile area’Exchange Server’s “enormous complexity, both in terms of feature set and architecture”, makes it “an amazingly fertile area for vulnerability research”, said Zuckerbraun.This comment echoed similar sentiments expressed recently by fellow researcher Orange Tsai in relation to his ‘ProxyShell’, ‘ProxyOracle’, and ‘ProxyLogon’ exploits at Black Hat USA 2021.Describing Exchange Server as “a buried treasure”, Tsai said ‘ProxyLogon’, which was involved in the compromise of hundreds of thousands of enterprise messaging servers in March, was potentially “the most severe vulnerability in the history of Microsoft Exchange”.This article was updated with comments from Dustin Childs from the ZDI on August 31, and a comment from Microsoft on September 1.DON’T FORGET TO READ Rampant misconfigurations in Microsoft Power Apps exposed 38 million records",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/microsoft-exchange-server-had-proxytoken-vulnerability-that-leaked-incoming-emails,"['Microsoft', 'Email', 'Security', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Enterprise', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Privacy', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'RCE', 'Organizations', 'Vietnam', 'Asia']"
no,Deserialization bug in TensorFlow machine learning framework allowed arbitrary code execution,Developers revoke YAML support to protect against exploitation,"The team behind TensorFlow, Google’s popular open source Python machine learning library, has revoked support for YAML due to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.YAML is a general-purpose format used to store data and pass objects between processes and applications. Many Python applications use YAML to serialize and deserialize objects.According to an advisory on GitHub, TensorFlow and Keras, a wrapper library for TensorFlow, used an unsafe function to deserialize YAML-encoded machine learning models.A proof-of-concept shows the vulnerability being exploited to return the contents of a sensitive system file:“Given that YAML format support requires a significant amount of work, we have removed it for now,” the maintainers of the library said in their advisory.Deserialization insecurity“Deserialization bugs are a great attack surface for codes written in languages like Python, PHP, and Java,” Arjun Shibu, the security researcher who discovered the bug, told The Daily Swig.“I searched for Pickle and PyYAML deserialization patterns in TensorFlow and, surprisingly, I found a call to the dangerous function yaml.unsafe_load().”READ MORE Microsoft warns of critical Azure Cloud vulnerability impacting Cosmos DB accountsThe function loads a YAML input directly without sanitizing it, which makes it possible to inject the data with malicious code.Unfortunately, insecure deserialization is a common practice.“Researching further using code searching applications like Grep.app, I saw thousands of projects/libraries deserializing python objects without validation,” Arjun said. “Most of them were ML specific and take user input as parameters.”Impact on machine learning applicationsThe use of serialization is very common in machine learning applications. Training models is a costly and slow process. Therefore, developers often used pre-trained models that have been stored in YAML or other formats supported by ML libraries such as TensorFlow.“Since ML applications usually accept model configuration from users, I guess the availability of the vulnerability is common, making a large proportion of products at risk,” Arjun said.Read more of the latest hacking newsRegarding the YAML vulnerability, Pin-Yu Chen, chief scientist at RPI-IBM AI research collaboration at IBM Research, told The Daily Swig:“From my understanding, most cloud-based AI/ML services would require YAML files to specify the configurations – so I would say the security indication is huge.”A lot of the research around machine learning security is focused on adversarial attacks – modified pieces of data that target the behavior of ML models. But this latest discovery is a reminder that like all other applications, secure coding is an important aspect of machine learning.“Though these attacks are not targeting the machine learning model itself, there is no denying that they are serious threats and require immediate actions,” Chen said.Machine learning securityGoogle has patched more than 100 security bugs on TensorFlow since the beginning of the year. It has also published comprehensive security guidelines on running untrusted models, sanitizing untrusted user input, and securely serving models on the web.“These vulnerabilities are easy to find and using vulnerability scanners can help,” Arjun said.“Usually, there are alternatives with better security. Developers should use them whenever possible. For example, usage of unsafe_load() or load() with the default YAML loader can be replaced with the secure safe_load() function. The user input should be sanitized if there are no better alternatives.”INTERVIEW How one of the UK’s busiest airports defends against cyber-attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/deserialization-bug-in-tensorflow-machine-learning-framework-allowed-arbitrary-code-execution,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Google', 'Python', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'AI', 'Research', 'PHP', 'java', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Cloud', 'Security']"
no,Microsoft warns of critical Azure Cloud vulnerability impacting Cosmos DB accounts,Researchers say the issue has been exploitable for ‘months’,"Microsoft has urged customers to take action following the discovery of an Azure Cloud vulnerability allowing remote account takeover in Cosmos DB.Disclosed by the Wiz security team on August 26, the critical vulnerability, nicknamed ‘#ChaosDB’, was found on August 9 and is described as an “unprecedented” flaw in the Azure Cosmos DB database.Due to the severity of the vulnerability, the full technical details of the bug and the means to exploit it have not been released.Read more of the latest cloud security newsHowever, Wiz says that a chain of vulnerabilities found in the Jupyter Notebook feature of the platform can be used to query information about a target database and obtain credentials for Cosmos DB accounts, Jupyter Notebook compute, and Jupyter storage accounts.This includes primary keys. Once an attacker has stolen a key, they could then access, view, tamper with, and delete information in a Cosmos DB database without authorization.MisFortune 500“The vulnerability has a trivial exploit that doesn’t require any previous access to the target environment, and impacts thousands of organizations, including numerous Fortune 500 companies,” Wiz says.The researchers reported the security flaw to Microsoft on August 12. The company disabled vulnerable elements of the Jupyter feature within 48 hours of private disclosure.By August 16, Wiz observed that credentials obtained during testing had been revoked, and 24 hours later, the team were awarded a $40,000 bug bounty reward.Meanwhile, Microsoft launched its own investigation and was able to confirm that several thousand customers could be affected.Cutting new keysThe Redmond-based giant publicly disclosed the vulnerability on August 26 in an advisory sent to impacted customers. As the company is unable to roll out primary keys on behalf of its customers, Microsoft is urging customers to regenerate their keys as soon as possible.“Microsoft has recently become aware of a vulnerability in Azure Cosmos DB that could potentially allow a user to gain access to another customer’s resources by using the account's primary read-write key,” the company said.Microsoft added that there were no indicators of exploitation or data theft in the wild, nor that anyone outside of Wiz had obtained access to primary read-write keys associated with Azure Cosmos DB accounts.Wiz says that organizations should “assume” they have been exposed to attack due to the length of time it took to find and fix the flaw. Approximately 30% of Cosmos DB clients have been notified, but the researchers say they believe the number of customers impacted may be “far higher”.A technical paper describing Wiz’s findings will be published in the future.CVEs are not generally issued for cloud security problems. However, at Black Hat USA 2021 Wiz called for a CVE cloud security initiative that would change this approach.RELATED Rampant misconfigurations in Microsoft Power Apps exposed 38 million records",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/microsoft-warns-of-critical-azure-cloud-vulnerability-impacting-cosmos-db-accounts,"['Cloud', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Microsoft', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Authentication', 'Privacy', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"

no,Cybercrime triathlete jailed for 11 years over trio of online scams,"Romanian national sent down after admitting vishing, phishing, and money laundering rackets","A Romanian national has been jailed in the US for 140 months following his conviction for involvement in a trio of online scams.Adrian Mitan, 36, previously pleaded guilty in January 2020 to three forms of cybercrime, namely an auction fraud scheme (targeting listings on Craigslist), a credit card phishing and brute-force attack scheme, and a vishing* scheme.The credit card fraud scheme involved phishing for credit card information from victims and then “brute force attacking point of sale systems to obtain all necessary data to create new cloned credit or debit cards”. Counterfeit cards using compromised account information were used to fraudulently withdraw funds from victims’ account using ATMs by Mitan and his co-conspirators.Catch up on the latest cybercrime news and analysisThe vishing scheme was the most complex of the three scams in play.The technique involved “hacking into small businesses’ Voice over Internet Protocol systems and then deploying a script to contact financial institution customers to defraud them in providing their personal debit and credit card codes,” according to a US Department of Justice statement on the case.Mitan admitted that he and his co-conspirators obtained codes for roughly 2,130 access devices, targeting more than 10 financial institutions’ customers, according to prosecutors.The total amount Mitan illicitly earned through his cybercrime triathlon was not specified by the DoJ but can reasonably be assumed to be high given the severity of the sentence he received.*Vishing is commonly applied to the techniques of tricking prospective marks into handing over sensitive information through voice communication rather than (as with phishing) a counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent website. Mitan and his cronies appear to have extended this approach beyond the bounds of the current law enforcement/cybercrime lexicon.RELATED Founder of bitcoin money laundering service admits $300 million racket",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cybercrime-triathlete-jailed-for-11-years-over-trio-of-online-scams,"['Cybercrime', 'Phishing', 'Fraud', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Database', 'Security']"
no,‘Trilateration’ vulnerability in dating app Bumble leaked users’ exact location,"Attack built on previous Tinder exploit earned researcher – and ultimately, a charity – $2k","A security vulnerability in popular dating app Bumble enabled attackers to pinpoint other users’ precise location.Bumble, which has more than 100 million users worldwide, emulates Tinder’s ‘swipe right’ functionality for declaring interest in potential dates and in showing users’ approximate geographic distance from potential ‘matches’.Using fake Bumble profiles, a security researcher fashioned and executed a ‘trilateration’ attack that determined an imagined victim’s precise location.As a result, Bumble fixed a vulnerability that posed a stalking risk had it been left unresolved.Catch up on the latest mobile security news and analysisRobert Heaton, software engineer at payments processor Stripe, said his find could have empowered attackers to discover victims’ home addresses or, to some degree, track their movements.However, “it wouldn't give an attacker a literal live feed of a victim’s location, since Bumble doesn't update location all that often, and rate limits might mean that you can only check [say] once an hour (I don't know, I didn't check),” he told The Daily Swig.The researcher claimed a $2,000 bug bounty for the find, which he donated to the Against Malaria Foundation.Flipping the scriptAs part of his research, Heaton developed an automated script that sent a sequence of requests to Bumble servers that repeatedly relocated the ‘attacker’ before requesting the distance to the victim.“If an attacker (i.e. us) can find the point at which the reported distance to a user flips from, say, 3 miles to 4 miles, the attacker can infer that this is the point at which their victim is exactly 3.5 miles away from them,” he explains in a blog post that conjured a fictional scenario to demonstrate how an attack might unfold in the real world.For example, “3.49999 miles rounds down to 3 miles, 3.50000 rounds up to 4,” he added.Once the attacker finds three “flipping points” they would have the three exact distances to their victim required to execute precise trilateration.However, rather than rounding up or down, it transpired that Bumble always rounds down – or ‘floors’ – distances.“This discovery doesn’t break the attack,” said Heaton. “It just means you have to edit your script to note that the point at which the distance flips from 3 miles to 4 miles is the point at which the victim is exactly 4.0 miles away, not 3.5 miles.”Heaton was also able to spoof ‘swipe yes’ requests on anyone who also declared an interest to a profile without paying a $1.99 fee. The hack relied on circumventing signature checks for API requests.Trilateration and TinderHeaton’s research drew on a similar trilateration vulnerability unearthed in Tinder in 2013 by Max Veytsman, which Heaton examined among other location-leaking vulnerabilities in Tinder in a previous blog post.Tinder, which hitherto sent user-to-user distances to the app with 15 decimal places of precision, fixed this vulnerability by calculating and rounding distances on their servers before relaying fully-rounded values to the app.Bumble appears to have emulated this approach, said Heaton, which nevertheless failed to thwart his precise trilateration attack.Similar vulnerabilities in dating apps were also disclosed by researchers from Synack in 2015, with the subtle difference being that their ‘triangulation’ attacks involved using trigonometry to ascertain distances.Future proofingHeaton reported the vulnerability on June 15 and the bug was apparently fixed within 72 hours.In particular, he praised Bumble for adding extra controls “that prevent you from matching with or viewing users who aren’t in your match queue” as “a shrewd way to reduce the impact of future vulnerabilities”.In his vulnerability report, Heaton also recommended that Bumble round users’ locations to the nearest 0.1 degree of longitude and latitude before calculating distances between these two rounded locations and rounding the result to the nearest mile.“There would be no way that a future vulnerability could expose a user’s exact location via trilateration, since the distance calculations won’t even have access to any exact locations,” he explained.He told The Daily Swig he is not yet sure if this recommendation was acted upon.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/trilateration-vulnerability-in-dating-app-bumble-leaked-users-exact-location,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Privacy', 'Mobile', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques']"

no,UK firm accused of bullying small businesses with CSP patent infringement letters backtracks,Datawing disavows CSP nonce legal offensive,"UPDATED A UK firm has backtracked after sending letters alleging patent infringement to a set of small businesses who had enabled the CSP nonces web security feature.Content Security Policy (CSP) in general is a technology geared towards mitigating cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.CSP nonces offer an extension to the technology, introduced five years ago with CSP version 2, and supported by the Nginx web server and Cloudflare Workers, among others.Patent trolling?UK firm Datawing claims that the technology is covered by US and UK patents it holds.The UK patent had lapsed but was renewed in May 2021 just weeks before Datawing sent out a legal nastygram to small UK-based companies, a small subset of the organizations that it claims were violating its patent.Websites turning on security features in the browser are being informed of alleged patent infringement and told they ought to license Datawing’s Scriptlock product, software designed to prevent the unauthorised execution of JavaScript.A copy of the contentious letter can be found here.Catch up on the latest security-related legal newsThe legal offensive was spotted by prominent UK security researcher Scott Helme, who questioned the applicability of the patent to a broadly used web security technology. Helme did not receive a letter himself but does run a website, Report URI, that uses CSP nonces.Helme slammed Datawing as acting like a patent troll in a detailed blog post on the topic.The security researcher told The Daily Swig that Datawing had set about targeting “smaller organizations that are likely to be intimidated by these letters and pay the license fee”.Meanwhile the Public Interest Patent Law Institute offered support to organizations that had received letters from Datawing, a move that greatly reduced its prospects of extracting a licensing fee from letter recipients.Datawing takes frightIn the face of this opposition, Datawing decided to abandon its licensing campaign, admitting that its letters were “ill advised” and apologizing for any upset it had caused.William Coppock, managing director of Datawing, told The Daily Swig: “In short I was ill advised, and the letters were a complete error in judgement.“I’m truly sorry to have caused upset over this. I’ll be writing to the 25 companies concerned to apologise for the upset caused.”Datawing bristles at criticism that its letters were threatening.Coppock concluded: “I did not intend for my letters to be interpreted as a threat. The intention was only to explain the situation in an open and neutral manner and ask for support.”Alex Moss of the Public Interest Patent Law Institute welcomed Datawing’s decision while warning that the whole incident is part of a wider problem rooted in poorly issued patents.“Datawing’s decision to drop its demands is a victory for internet users everywhere as well as those wrongly accused,” Moss told The Daily Swig. “But things like this happen too often, and rarely end so well.""Moss concluded: ""This will only stop when patent offices stop issuing overbroad software patents that take far more out of the public domain than they contribute.”This story was updated to add comment from the Public Interest Patent Law Institute.READ Citrix quietly restores vulnerability credits to Positive Technologies researchers after Russian infosec firm’s erasure",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/uk-firm-accused-of-bullying-small-businesses-with-csp-patent-infringement-letters-backtracks,"['Legal', 'Browsers', 'Secure', 'Development', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'XSS', 'Organizations', 'North', 'America']"
no,Citrix quietly restores vulnerability credits to Positive Technologies researchers after Russian infosec firm’s erasure,One of two deleted credits was for the most frequently targeted flaw of 2020,"A Russian cybersecurity firm subject to US government sanctions has hailed the restoration of vulnerability credits to its security researchers after they were mysteriously removed from security advisories by Citrix.On Monday (August 23), Positive Technologies tweeted that acknowledgements for the discovery of security flaws in Citrix products by Mikhail Klyuchnikov and Andrey Medov had been excised from separate advisories published by the cloud computing, application virtualization, and networking giant.“@Citrix we will be pleased to hear your response,” added the Moscow-based firm.As of yesterday (August 24) – a day later – Citrix had quietly restored the credits.US Census Bureau hackMikhail Klyuchnikov’s acknowledgement, which is now restored alongside those of two Paddy Power Betfair developers, was in relation to the discovery of a zero-day vulnerability in the Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway in late 2019.CVE-2019-19781 allowed an unauthenticated attacker to perform arbitrary code execution on a network, potentially allowing access to private network resources without requiring authentication.The critical vulnerability (CVSS 9.8) was behind the failed hack of US Census Bureau systems in January, and was last month described in a joint cybersecurity advisory from the US, UK, and Australia as the most regularly-targeted flaw during 2020.Andrey Medov, meanwhile, reported a high severity flaw in the Citrix XenMobile Server Path Traversal in February 2020 (CVE-2020-8209).Tweeting yesterday, Positive Technologies said: “Citrix has restored the acknowledgment of our researchers in its advisories! We would like to express our gratitude to the community for your support and making information security more transparent.”‘Groundless’ accusationsWhile Citrix hasn’t yet responded to our questions about the withdrawal and restoration of the acknowledgements, at least one industry professional has speculated that the answer may lie with the US government.In April, under a new Executive Order, the US Treasury announced targeted sanctions on technology companies that it claimed supported the Russian intelligence services’ efforts to carry out malicious cyber activities against the US.Positive Technologies, whose website numbers Samsung, Allianz, and Societe Generale among its clients, has denied the accusations, which it describes as “groundless”.As previously reported by Forbes, Positive Technologies’ majority owner Yury Maksimov has said his company only provides defensive services to Russia’s Ministry of Defense and FSB – and would happily do the same for its US counterparts.The US government also claimed Positive Technologies “hosts large-scale conventions that are used as recruiting events for the FSB and GRU [Russian military intelligence]”.Positive Technolgies has described its annual Positive Hack Days (PHDays) event as “a public platform for the exchange of expertise, learning, and advanced training in cybersecurity” that “attracts thousands of cybersecurity and business experts from different countries”.It added: “Our researchers detect hundreds of zero-day vulnerabilities per year in IT systems of various classes and types. All of the vulnerabilities found, without exception, are provided to the software manufacturers as part of the responsible disclosure policy and are not made public until the necessary updates are released.”The Daily Swig has contacted Citrix for an explanation of its removal and restoration of the credits, and we will update the story if and when we receive a reply.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/citrix-quietly-restores-vulnerability-credits-to-positive-technologies-researchers-after-russian-infosec-firms-erasure,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Industry', 'News', 'Russia', 'Zero-day', 'Research', 'Europe', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'RCE', 'Path', 'Traversal', 'Authentication', 'Secure', 'Development', 'VDP', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise']"

no,Critical vulnerabilities in web file manager elFinder leave servers susceptible to takeover,Immediate triage urged as researchers warn in-the-wild exploitation likely,"UPDATED Critical vulnerabilities in elFinder, the popular open source web file manager, can enable unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on servers hosting elFinder’s back-end PHP connector.Security researchers have documented five vulnerability chains that combine otherwise “innocuous bugs” to forge exploit chains capable of seizing control of servers.Fortunately, the flaws were recently patched. Thomas Chauchefoin, vulnerability researcher at SonarSource, urged users to update their systems as soon as possible.Read more of the latest infosec research news“There is no doubt these vulnerabilities will also be exploited in the wild, because exploits targeting old versions have been publicly released and the connectors filenames are part of compilations of paths to look for when trying to compromise websites,” he said in a blog post.“Arbitrary code execution was easily demonstrated, and attackers won’t have much trouble replicating it”, he added.Other products at riskWorse still, the impact potentially extends well beyond elFinder. “All these bug classes are very common in software that exposes filesystems to users, and are likely to impact a broad range of products,” explained Chauchefoin.JavaScript-based elFinder, which is used to manage local and remote files, can be included in many frameworks thanks to third-party packages for Laravel and Symfony.It is also used by WordPress File Manager, which runs on more than 700,000 websites. “But you need an administrator account to reach the connector and to exploit the vulnerabilities we discovered,” Chauchefoin told The Daily Swig.The flawsAll rated CVSS 9.8, the flaws include four issues affecting elFinder 2.1.58 and below that can enable attackers to move or delete arbitrary files, as well as argument injection and race condition bugs (CVE-2021-32682).Versions before 2.1.58 are also affected by a remote code execution (RCE) bug that is exploited via the execution of PHP code in a .phar file – but only if the server parses .phar files as PHP (CVE-2021-23394).All five flaws bar the race condition bug affect elFinder in its default ‘safe’ configuration, which was introduced in the wake of in-the-wild attacks targeting the application’s previous configuration, according to Chauchefoin.Asked which vulnerability was most interesting or impactful, Chauchefoin cited the argument injection bug in the archive handler. “Argument injections are still everywhere and easy to overlook when reviewing code, but 99% of the time they can be exploited in a way to execute arbitrary commands on the server,” he explained. This bug class allowed us to compromise most of the PHP supply chain earlier this year so it’s one of my personal favorites.” The vulnerabilities were reported to the project maintainers on March and patched in version 2.1.59, which was released in June. SonarSource published technical details on August 17.‘Highly security-sensitive’Chauchefoin expressed hope that the findings from his team’s research would help “break future bug chains and reduce the risk of similar issues”.He added: “We also learned that working with paths is not easy and that extra measures should be taken: performing additional checks in the ‘low-level’ functions, using basename() and dirname() with confidence (and knowing their limits!) and always validating user-controlled data.”Chauchefoin suggested that web file managers remain a source of concern over security.“An application’s interaction with the file system is always highly security sensitive, since minor functional bugs can easily be the source of exploitable vulnerabilities,” he explained.“This observation is especially true in the case of web file managers, whose role is to replicate the features of a complete file system and expose it to the client’s browser in a transparent way.”This article was updated with comments from Thomas Chauchefoin of SonarSource on August 31.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/critical-vulnerabilities-in-web-file-manager-elfinder-leave-servers-susceptible-to-takeover,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'PHP', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cyber-attacks', 'RCE', 'JavaScript', 'Research', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Authentication', 'Browsers', 'Privacy', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'WordPress']"

no,Good education: Cyber awareness initiative aims to close infosec workforce gap with free school curriculum,Cyber.org leads program to bring better cybersecurity to US classrooms,"A US government funded program aims to close the infosec workforce gap by teaching children as young as five years old about cybersecurity.The initiative is led by Cyber.org, the academic branch of the Cyber Innovation Center, a research foundation promoting research, education, and technical innovation. It is geared towards creating alliances between government, private, and academic institutions.The program, funded by the Department of Homeland Security, has launched a framework of standards for what needs to be taught to children from kindergarten to the 12th grade (K-12).This in turn, they hope, will promote and encourage children to consider a career in cybersecurity from a young age.Speaking to The Daily Swig, Kevin Nolten, director of academic outreach at Cyber.org, said that a cybersecurity education is just as important as other school taught life skills, such as health studies and home economics.READ Universities struggle to defend against surging cyber-attacks during coronavirus pandemicNolten said: ""What we noticed is that there is a lack of unity with regards to what is being taught at different grade levels.""We look[ed] at math standards, and math standards are important because it gives a fourth-grade teacher, a seventh-grade teacher, a 12th grade teacher, a guide for what to teach at what point in the academic year.""It [the framework] is a guide that says a student should know these concepts before advancing to the next grade.""And what we saw was a lack of standards in the education world for cybersecurity education, our friends at Code.org and the Computer Science Teachers Association did a phenomenal job with computer science standards, and those have been widely adopted across the country, but we're still lacking [in] cybersecurity [standards].Nolten added: ""Our goal is that states across the country are going to adopt [the framework].""Cyber.org is helping to educated the next generation of cybersecurity expertsBuilding a solid foundationThe program is free to schools, with a particular focus on less generously funded institutions. Nolten said that the curriculum provides both online resources and written worksheets so that it can be accessible regardless of a school's existing IT resources.The curriculum was written with the help of 33 educators who guided Cyber.org employees on what topics to introduce to the classroom.Of the topics covered, Nolten highlights cyber awareness as one of the most important lessons.He told The Daily Swig: ""My goal for students is [to get] every student cyber literate, no matter what career they're going into, no matter what job they're going to have in the future, no matter what degree program they're going to enter.""Cybersecurity plays a role in [the career of] every doctor, lawyer, veterinarian, police officer, the owner of the flower shop on the corner of third and main street,"" Nolten joked.""So, ensuring that these students have a foundation knowledge of computing systems, digital citizenship, and cybersecurity, is to me the most important element.""Model behaviorThe initiative places as much emphasis on educating kindergarten children, typically four to five years old, as it does high school leavers.While grades 10 through 12 might focus on the next steps to a career in industry, the curriculum for younger children focuses on how to use the internet safely and responsibility.Nolten said: ""My four-year-old knows how to operate my iPhone. They know how to get access to my iPhone. They know exactly where the apps are, how to play their games, but we also need to ensure that we're teaching them how to be responsible online.""This responsibility, says Nolten, extends to preventing cyber bullying and teaching model good behavior.Concluding, Nolten told The Daily Swig that one of the greatest threats to US national security is ""the lack of K-12 resources"".""From the private sector to the public sector, we need to have a buy-in (funding) from our K-12 systems and our higher education institutions to start pulling all in the same direction.""We have to stop competing with each other because our successes [are] all built together, yield a cyber literate population that will not only give us a globally competitive economy, but it will also help deter, and hopefully prevent, the cyber-attacks that are plaguing our backyard each and every day.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE UK universities awarded funding for research into IoT, smart home security",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/good-education-cyber-awareness-initiative-aims-to-close-infosec-workforce-gap-with-free-school-curriculum,"['US', 'Education', 'Interviews', 'Government', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Analysis', 'North', 'America', 'Industry', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Phishing', 'Organizations']"

no,"Fortinet WAF vulnerable to command injection attacks, researchers find",Patch for FortiWeb flaw due over the coming days,"UPDATED A vulnerability has been discovered in Fortinet’s web application firewall (WAF) that allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on devices and servers running the security software, according to new findings by Rapid7.FortiWeb protects web applications from attacks that target known and unknown vulnerabilities. Fortinet provides FortiWeb as a SaaS offering as well hardware WAFs with various network capacities.According to Rapid7’s William Wu, the SAML configuration page of FortiWeb had a command injection vulnerability that allowed attackers to embed arbitrary system commands in web requests.These commands would then be executed as the root user on the operating system running FortiWeb.Authentication requiredA proof of concept shows how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by adding a backtick and an arbitrary command to an HTTP request.The vulnerability is only accessible to authenticated parties, so an adversary would need to gain access to the administrator’s credentials before staging the attack.However, once the device is compromised, the attacker can leverage the vulnerability to control the affected device “with the highest possible privileges”, according to Rapid7.“The disclosed FortiWeb issue is essentially a privilege escalation from ‘Fortiweb user’ to ‘Operating System root,’ so an attacker who already has a method for being authenticated can take control of the underlying machine that is running the Fortiweb application,” Tod Beardsley, director of research at Rapid7, told The Daily Swig.Read more of the latest infosec research news“[The attacker] might install a persistent shell, crypto-mining software, or other malicious software,” Rapid7 wrote in its advisory.If the device’s management interface is exposed to the internet, the attacker could use the compromised platform to reach into the affected network beyond the secured perimeter.Rapid7’s researchers found less than 300 FortiWeb devices that had their management interface accessible through the general internet.Patch incomingFortinet will patch the bug in the next version of FortiWeb (6.4.1), which according to Rapid7 will be released later in August.In the meantime, Rapid7 advises administrators to make FortiWeb’s device management interface inaccessible to untrusted networks, including the general internet.“Generally speaking, management interfaces for devices like FortiWeb should not be exposed directly to the internet anyway.“In nearly all cases, this is a bad idea, since it opens up a whole bunch of attack surfaces to strangers on the internet, often for no real reason or upside,” Beardsley warned. “Web management consoles should really only be exposed to trusted networks, so internal-only or over VPN.”This article has been updated to include comment from Rapid7.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/fortinet-waf-vulnerable-to-command-injection-attacks-researchers-find,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'Industry', 'News', 'WAF', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'VPN', 'Network', 'Security', 'Malware', 'RCE', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps']"

no,Nation-state threat: How DDoS-over-TCP technique could amplify attacks,Researchers detail novel way of increasing cyber-attack surface,"A new type of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack could allow nation-state actors to censor internet access and target any website by abusing middleboxes.A team from the University of Maryland and the University of Colorado Boulder used an artificial intelligence algorithm to reveal the technique, which is, they say, the first TCP-based DDoS amplification attack of its kind.In the past, reflective amplification attacks have largely been restricted to User Datagram Protocol (UDP) based protocols.However, says the team, taking advantage of widespread TCP-non-compliance in network middleboxes can cause them to respond and amplify network traffic – potentially generating massive amplification.Read more of the latest infosec research and news“Some of the largest, most threatening amplification factors in the past have been in the order of 500 times, with one recent amplification attack in the 10,000 times range,” says Dave Levin, an assistant professor of computer science at UMD.“We’ve discovered amplification attacks that offer 100,000-plus, one million-plus, and even technically infinite amplification.”Most nation-state censorship infrastructure can currently be exploited in this way, along with many off-the-shelf commercial firewalls.“Some nation states have long been known to censor their own citizens online. What this paper – and another concurrent paper of ours – shows is that nation-state censors pose an even greater threat to the internet as a whole,” says Levin.“Attackers can use the censorship infrastructure – usually many firewalls deployed at their borders – to launch denial-of-service attacks on anyone on the internet.”Tough defenseDefending against these attacks will be difficult, says the team. Since middleboxes are spoofing the IP address of the traffic they generate, the attacker can set the source IP address of the reflected traffic to be any IP address behind the middlebox.In the case of nation-state censorship infrastructure, this could be any IP address within that country, making it difficult for a victim to drop traffic from offending IP addresses during an attack.Weak censorshipLast September, the researchers privately shared their findings with a number of national computer emergency readiness teams (CERTs), DDoS mitigation services, and firewall manufacturers.However, they say, fixing the problem would not only mean every vulnerable firewall manufacturer updating its middleboxes, but would also require nations to weaken their censorship infrastructure – a highly unlikely scenario.The team has released a series of scripts and tools for network administrators to test their middleboxes via a GitHub repository.The Daily Swig has reached out to the research team for further comment and will update this article accordingly.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Research: Hundreds of high-traffic web domains vulnerable to same-site attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nation-state-threat-how-ddos-over-tcp-technique-could-amplify-attacks,"['DDoS', 'Research', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'US', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Industry', 'News', 'Cyber', 'Warfare']"

The software is used in products ranging from WiFi routers to IP cameras.Read more of the latest infosec research news from around the worldThe flaws affect several versions of Realtek SDKs: Realtek SDK v2.x, various Realtek ‘Jungle’ SDK versions, and Realtek ‘Luna’ SDK up to version 1.3.2.IoT Inspector discovered four vulnerabilities: a ‘WiFi Simple Config’ stack buffer overflow via UPnP (CVE-2021-35392); a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2021-35393); a command injection in the MP Daemon diagnostic tool (CVE-2021-35394); and CVE-2021-35395, which lists multiple vulnerabilities in the SDK’s management web interface.Unauthenticated RCEThe most serious of the web interface flaws is an arbitrary command execution in formSysCmd, as little skill is needed to exploit the bug, IoT Inspector’s managing director Florian Lukavsky told The Daily Swig.“By exploiting these vulnerabilities, remote unauthenticated attackers can fully compromise the target device and execute arbitrary code with the highest level of privilege,” IoT Inspector warned in its advisory blog post.The researchers used Shodan to identify potentially vulnerable systems, and also found that wireless routers from a number of ISPs, primarily in India, Taiwan, and China, were vulnerable.Securing the supply chainResearchers have previously identified vulnerabilities in devices using the Realtek SDK. But, Lukavsky explained, these have been attributed to the device manufacturers rather than to the SDK supplier itself.Manufacturers have patched vulnerabilities in their branches of the code but, Lukavsky says, these have not been passed back to Realtek so the fix could be made more widely available.Security experts are warning users of devices with the Realtek SDK, and other IoT hardware, to run software updates, enable “optional” security features and change default credentials where they can.“The vulnerabilities listed here are not trivial,” Dray Agha, cybersecurity consultant at Crest member firm Jumpsec told The Daily Swig.INSIGHT Fight or flight: How one of the UK’s busiest airports defends against cyber-attacks“They err on the side of irresponsible to be frank, as near every vulnerability listed would give an adversary unfettered control over the device they target.”“Looking at the list of manufacturers who are affected by the Realtek SDK vulnerabilities, it’s concerning that an attacker could gain control of a wireless router through these exploits.“Given that wireless routers are a central ‘node’ for many devices, compromise here would spell disaster for all of the other devices you have in your home and workplace.”Realtek has issued patches and a security advisory (PDF) for the affected components.HACKING TOOLS Bow to the USBsamurai: Malicious USB cable leaves air-gapped networks open to attack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/realtek-sdk-vulnerabilities-impact-dozens-of-downstream-iot-vendors,"['IoT', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Hardware', 'Network', 'Security', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'India', 'China', 'Asia', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'Telecommunications']"

We get some incredibly sophisticated looking phishing campaigns – you know, some of them land [in my inbox] and even I’m hovering over it because it looks legit and I’m not 100% sure.“But of the regular kind of day-to-day threats, I guess the biggest one that we see most often is phishing because it’s such an easy win for attackers.“It’s fully automated, they haven’t got somebody sitting there in a dark basement trying to get into our environment, and it’s an easy one that you can just push across to millions of recipients in a second. So that’s the big one that we’re managing.”Nearly 30 million passengers travelled through Manchester Airport in 2019As anyone who works in threat prevention will know, protecting against attacks is often easier said than done – especially at a large business or organization.MAG, which manages Manchester Airport, East Midlands Airport, and London Stanstead Airport, has an estimated 40,000 employees working across these different locations.MUST READ Making justice secure again: How New Jersey Courts tackled the rush to remote working at the start of the Covid-19 pandemicTo reduce the risk of successful social engineering attacks, the group’s security operations center (SOC) provides what it calls ‘nano training’ – a series of short tutorials – on a monthly basis.“They are tiny, bite sized, and web-based – it usually takes two minutes to do, and we’re constantly reinforcing everything.“So that’s thinking before you click, thinking about spam, are you sure this is the person they claim to be, and things like GDPR and data protection.“It’s that broad spectrum of potential risks to the organization in terms of cyber-attacks.”Read more of the latest news about phishing attacksHe also reiterates to colleagues: “If you’re not sure, ask.”Johnson said that although the training is not mandatory, there is strong uptake due to the simplicity of the material.He said: “I think it was a deliberate decision not to make it mandatory because [when it does], it kind of becomes a bit of a chore.”The biggest threat to airports is phishing campaigns, says JohnsonMoving targetIn recent years, critical national infrastructure including airports have become an increasingly attractive target for hackers.While customer data is a potential big earner for cybercriminals, Johnson said that he believes attackers are mainly just trying to gain insight into the organizations’ networks.“In my opinion, what they’re trying to do is get a foothold,” he said.“If they get a foothold, they get a handling in your organization, they may never choose to use that. But it’s quite possible that once they’ve got that, the first thing they’ll do is go straight out onto the dark web and see if anybody else has any interest in a foothold in organization X.“I think that mostly it’s about trying to get that connection. And if we [the SOC] weren’t paying attention, you know, you’d be amazed what they can get away with.”“It comes down to the fact that we are part of the UK critical national infrastructure and we’re a nice target in terms of, if you can stop planes taking off, you’re going to get on the news,” he said, adding that “getting their name out there” is a big motivator for international cybercrime units.OnboardingMAG recently completed the migration all of its cybersecurity operations from external management to in-house control.Johnson explained that in addition to a cost-saving bonus, the new team has greater visibility over its network and has been able to streamline policies and procedures for the organization.When asked whether the group planned to undertake such an effort due to reduced traffic levels caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Johnson said the timing was merely accidental.“It was a coincidence, but it was also a happy coincidence,” he told The Daily Swig.READ Bad education: Universities struggle to defend against surging cyber-attacks during coronavirus pandemicThey had already decided to move in-house once a deal with the previous third-party provider had come to an end, which happened to coincide with the travel restrictions put in place.MAG spoke to colleagues at another airport who had worked with security consultants Bridewell, who were brought in to oversee the change.With the help of Bridewell, MAG implemented new measures and protections including a migration to the Microsoft Security Stack.Johnson said they “heavily invested” in the software and can now push around 80,000 data events per second.The organization manages multiple airports across the UKAccelerationLuckily, due to the lower volume of foot and air traffic on premises, the move was perhaps smoother than thought.“Where we had some advantages is things like 200 servers that were going to need a reboot.“[Before the pandemic] that would have been a logistically really complex process to go through because you’ve got to fit in with passenger flows.“It may have [previously] taken weeks to organize business downtime.“The really nice thing is it did mean that we could massively accelerate the program in terms of just getting it deployed.”YOU MAY LIKE Aaron Portnoy – ‘There’s no silver bullet for ransomware or supply chain attacks’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/fight-or-flight-how-one-of-the-uks-busiest-airports-defends-against-cyber-attacks,"['Interviews', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'UK', 'Organizations', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Europe', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Phishing', 'Network', 'Security', 'Microsoft', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Social', 'Engineering']"

That's because web security researchers are concerned about malicious actors compromising a website from the outside.Accordingly, many recent security upgrades to web protocols and browsers are centered on preventing cross-site attacks while placing more trust on sites that share a domain.Some of these security-focused upgrades include SameSite cookies, Site Isolation, and HTTP cache partitioning.RELATED Browser security briefing: Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a ‘post-XSS world’“The same-site security boundary is becoming more and more relevant,” Marco Squarcina, postdoctoral researcher at TU Wien, told The Daily Swig.“This inherent trust in same-site content inspired us to evaluate the presence of same-site threats and understand the security import on web applications.”Taking over subdomainsSquarcina and his colleagues investigated how attackers can enter the trust zones of targeted websites in order to attack them.Known as ‘related-domain attackers’, these adversaries operate a malicious website that is hosted on a domain that shares a suffix with that of the target website.Attackers can exploit DNS misconfigurations to hijack subdomains that are considered as trusted by the target website.Read more of the latest security research newsIn their paper, the researchers list possible causes of subdomain takeover. One key vulnerability vector is dangling DNS records, records in the authoritative DNS servers of a domain that point to expired resources that can be acquired by an adversary.“The most common cause of a takeover vulnerability is due to dangling records,” Squarcina said.“As an example, consider a subdomain of example.org, like foo.example.org, pointing to an expired domain name (e.g., fooexample.org) via a CNAME DNS entry. Attackers could simply register fooexample.org to fully control the page served at foo.example.org.”In their paper, the researchers also explore subdomain hijacking on corporate networks and roaming services, hosting providers and dynamic DNS services, and compromised hosts and websites.Related-domain attacksA successful subdomain takeover can lead to an array of threats, including phishing and malware distribution, Site Isolation protection circumvention, same-site request forgery, cookie confidentiality bypassing, Content Security Policy bypassing, and cross-origin resource-sharing abuse.“The privileged position controlled by RDAs enables a set of exclusive XSS, CSRF, Session Hijacking, and SOP bypass attacks that are not available to a standard web attacker,” Squarcina said.“For instance, the SameSite cookie attribute is an effective countermeasure against CSRF attacks, but it does not apply to requests originating from a page that is cross-origin but same-site to the target application.”Vulnerable domainsIn their research, Squarcina and his colleagues examined the top 50,000 domains in the Tranco list.According to their findings, 15% of large domains (more than 50,000 subdomains) were vulnerable.The researchers found subdomain takeover vulnerabilities on news websites like cnn.com and time.com, university portals like harvard.edu and mit.edu, government websites like europa.eu and nih.gov, and IT companies like lenovo.com and cisco.com.Interestingly, most of the discovered vulnerabilities could be fixed by routinely checking the validity of DNS records, which speaks to how little attention domain-related attacks are getting.“Overall, we identified 887 sites among the top 50,000 with takeover vulnerabilities,” Squarcina said.“This is, however, an under-approximation that does not take into account vulnerabilities caused by deprovisioned cloud resources. Therefore, we estimate takeover vulnerabilities to be even more pervasive than captured by these numbers.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/research-hundreds-of-high-traffic-web-domains-vulnerable-to-same-site-attacks,"['Browsers', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'XSS', 'DNS', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Chrome', 'Edge', 'Safari', 'Apple', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'Privacy', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cisco', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Phishing', 'Malware', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'CSRF']"
no,Exhaustive study puts China’s infamous Great Firewall under the microscope,"Censorship platform is distorting some internet lookups, researchers warn","China’s notorious website-blocking technology is impacting the global DNS system as well as restricting access to content locally, according to a comprehensive analysis of the technology.China’s DNS-based internet filtering apparatus – popularly known as the ‘Great Firewall’ – was observed for nine months by Citizen Lab-affiliated computer scientists using GFWatch, a platform capable of testing hundreds of domains a day.The platform, which enabled continuous monitoring of the Great Firewall’s filtering behavior detected that a total of 311,000 domains were being censored.ANALYSIS Behind the Great Firewall: Chinese cyber-espionage adapts to post-Covid world with stealthier attacksAfter reverse engineering these domains, members of the nine-person team discovered that 41,000 “innocuous” domains had been blocked.“We also observe bogus IPv6 and globally routable IPv4 addresses injected by the [Great Firewall], including addresses owned by US companies, such as Facebook, Dropbox, and Twitter,” the researchers report.This “abusive design” could lead to DDoS attacks on specific IPs, the researchers warn.Polluted cachesThe study – conducted by researchers from Stony Brook University, New York; University of Massachusetts, Amherst; and University of California, Berkeley – uncovered evidence that the Great Firewall is interfering with the smooth running of the internet.“We found 77,000 censored domains with DNS resource records polluted in popular public DNS resolvers, such as Google and Cloudflare,” according to the researchers.The impact of polluted DNS caches is that people outside China who use these public DNS services will accidentally obtain forged DNS records, preventing from accessing the actual websites even though both the client and website are not located inside China.Read more of the latest security news from AsiaAlthough China’s filtering system is tainting the well of global DNS resolution, the researchers suggest it is possible to “sanitize poisoned DNS records from the cache of public DNS resolvers”.During a related I2P censorship study, one of the researchers found that a client in South Korea was unable to access https://geti2p.net because of the GFW’s bi-directional DNS censorship.“In order to sanitize the polluted records from public DNS resolvers, the operators of these resolvers can simply verify DNS records against the pool of fake IPs used by the GFW that we have discovered here,” they advise.Usenix presentationA paper (PDF) on the research, entitled “How Great is the Great Firewall? Measuring China’s DNS Censorship”, is due to be presented this week during the 30th Usenix Security Symposium.Nguyen Phong Hoang, a computer scientist at Stony Brook University, New York, and lead author of the paper, told The Daily Swig that “DNS is the main mechanism and plays an important role in [China’s] internet censorship because almost every online communication/activity nowadays starts with a DNS lookup.”“While circumventing DNS censorship is not super difficult, it is still effective at preventing the vast majority of ordinary internet users in China from accessing contents that are deemed as ‘unwanted’ by the [Chinese] government,” Nguyen said.By monitoring the behavior of the Great Firewall, the researchers have been able to identify themes and trends for sites that end up on the blocklist.Nguyen explained: “Since the launch of our measurement platform, we have spotted several blockages that coincide with political events and informed the public in a timely fashion about these blocking cases and how they reflect Beijing’s policy.”RELATED Research roadblock: Security pros weigh in on China’s new vulnerability disclosure law",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/exhaustive-study-puts-chinas-infamous-great-firewall-under-the-microscope,"['China', 'DNS', 'Censorship', 'Surveillance', 'Research', 'Asia', 'Privacy', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Google', 'Cloudflare', 'Social', 'Media', 'Analysis', 'DDoS', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service']"

no,Apple drops controversial lawsuit against Corellium,Fears of chilling effect on security tool development lifted,"Apple has dropped a controversial intellectual property lawsuit against virtualization software maker Corellium just days before the case was due to go to trial.Corellium’s software technology enables users to create virtual iOS devices within a browser, allowing security researchers to more easily test for bugs and exploits.The same virtualization technology allows tech journalists to research stories into App Store security issues or run disposable instances of Signal.Apple filed suit in August 2019, contending that Corellium was replicating its operating system without permission.BACKGROUND Apple-Corellium lawsuit raises concerns among security research communityCorellium – which had been selling its technology for some time prior to the lawsuit – said its software was comparable to popular desktop virtualization tools from VMWare and Virtual Box.Corellium strongly disputed Apple’s claims of copyright infringement, as previously reported, suggesting Apple had launched its legal offensive after its attempt to acquire Corellium floundered in 2018.Sealed settlementThe action raised concerns in the security community that it could stifle security research, with others seeing the lawsuit as an example of Apple’s tendency to act as something of a control freak.Part of Apple’s case hinged on claims that Corellium circumvented Apple’s security measures in violation of the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).Last December, US District Judge Rodney Smit rejected Apple’s copyright infringement claims whilst allowing the DMCA strand of its lawsuit to proceed despite describing Apple’s legal protestations as “puzzling, if not disingenuous”.Read more Apple security newsThe case was due to be heard before a federal court in Florida starting next week (August 16) but the case has reportedly been settled. “The terms of the settlement were confidential,” the Washington Post reports.The Daily Swig approached Corellium for comment.

People don’t often read documentation and they’re not [usually] security experts either, so they won't be able to make the right decision most of the time.“We’ve seen this approach quite a lot recently, with other vendors we’ve worked with. The correct approach should be ‘secure by default’, not ‘it’s documented, it’s your responsibility now’.”Catch up on the latest cybersecurity vulnerability newsThe researcher suggests the issue could have been completely mitigated “by applying some filtering/encoding on that vulnerable input”.He added: “Even if they consider the ‘edit locale’ as a ‘super privilege’ this wasn’t clear to us during the pen test and it was definitely not clear to our customer either.”cPanel’s McIntire said that to protect themselves the server admin would simply have to remove any Locale Super Privileges granted to ‘untrusted’ resellers.“We appreciate Fortbridge’s responsible disclosure to us and hope that these explanations will ease any worries our customers may have regarding this issue,” he continued.“It is of upmost importance that you only give Super Privileges to people you would trust with root on your server.”Tiron said cPanel was notified of the vulnerabilities during May and June of this year.RECOMMENDED ‘A whole new attack surface’ – Researcher Orange Tsai documents ProxyLogon exploits against Microsoft Exchange Server",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/web-hosting-platform-cpanel-amp-whm-is-vulnerable-to-authenticated-rce-nbsp-and-privilege-escalation,"['RCE', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'XSS', 'CSRF', 'XXE', 'Research', 'Network', 'Security', 'Browsers', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Zero-day', 'WAF', 'Organizations', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'UK', 'US', 'Europe', 'North', 'America', 'Linux']"

Look no further:Attacking Let’s EncryptAt Black Hat, researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology showed how the security controls introduced with Let’s Encrypt’s multi-perspective validation feature might be abused.Circumventing these controls, which were introduced in February 2020 in response to earlier attacks, makes it possible for attackers to get digital certificates for web domains they do now own, offering a springboard for phishing attacks or other scams.By introducing packet loss or latency to connections to some of the nameservers, an attacker could force the system to rely on a nameserver of their choice – downgrading the security offered by multiperspective validation.The work shows that domain validation, though it enjoys advantages because it is low cost and lends itself to automation, is not yet secure and needs to be refined in order to become more effective as a barrier to fraud.Pulling the pin on FragAttacksAt Black Hat, security researcher Mathy Vanhoef shared his impressive work on FragAttacks fragmentation and aggregation attacks) and – with the help of Tom Van Goethem – timing attacks.For the former, he described how implementation flaws and design vulnerabilities in WiFi’s frame aggregation and fragmentation features affect all protected WiFi networks, and even the WEP protocol dating back to 1997.Certain implementation bugs were particularly widespread and trivial to exploit, he warned.The gradual adoption of ‘operating channel validation’ (PDF) and ‘beacon protection’ (PDF) will eventually offer a degree of protection from FragAttacks, he said.In a separate presentation last week, Vanhoef and Van Goethem elevated timing attacks to fresh heights, after surmounting a challenge that previously complicated remote assaults.Timing attacks, which infer secrets by measuring the execution time of cryptographic algorithms, have led to vulnerabilities surfacing in applications and cryptosystems that lack constant-time execution.While these side-channel exploits are possible over modern internet connections, “network jitter” has forced adversaries to collect thousands or millions of measurements to infer just a single bit of information.However, ‘timeless timing attacks’ are unaffected by network jitter because “two requests arrive in the same packets at the exact same time at the server”, explained Van Goethem.As a result, timing differences as small as 100ns can be detected over any internet connection – an accuracy comparable to attacks on local systems.Attacks can be launched against protocols that enable multiplexing or by leveraging a transport protocol that enables encapsulation, with the researchers successfully mounting attacks against HTTP/2 webservers and EAP-PWD, a popular Wi-Fi authentication protocol.Check out our previous coverage for more on this hacking technique.Request smuggling reduxPortSwigger security researcher James Kettle was back with a fresh perspective into how request smuggling can impact HTTP/2 infrastructure.The researcher demonstrated how attacks levied against HTTP/2 systems enabled him to steal secrets from websites running Amazon’s Application Load Balancer, poison every page on Bitbucket, and forced Atlassian to sign every single one of its users out of Jira.“If you take your frontend server, turn on HTTP/2 support and do downgrading, congratulations: you have just doubled the number of ways that you may be vulnerable to request smuggling,” Kettle warns.Check out our earlier coverage for full details on this latest web security research, which was presented at both Black Hat USA and DEF CON this year.Microsoft Exchange findings create ‘new paradigm for vulnerability research’Hacking whizz Orange Tsai lifted the lid on what he described as potentially “the most severe vulnerability in the history of Microsoft Exchange”.Fresh from his recent Pwn2Own and Pwnie Awards triumphs, the researcher recounted his discovery of a pre-authenticated remote code execution (RCE) flaw that was involved in the compromise of hundreds of thousands of enterprise messaging servers worldwide.But this was more than just another, albeit serious security flaw; it created a “new paradigm for vulnerability research”, no less.Tsai, principal security researcher at Devcore, discovered server-side, client-side, and cryptographic bugs on this “new attack surface” and corralled them into pre-auth RCE chains known as ProxyLogon and ProxyShell, along with ProxyOracle, a plaintext password recovery combo.The implications are serious: Microsoft Exchange Server is widely used by enterprise organizations and government agencies and Tsai found 400,000 internet-facing instances.The researcher said his investigations, which centered on a major architectural change made to Client Access services (CAS) in 2013, was so fruitful because he surveyed the target application from a high-level architectural perspective rather than simply hunting for particular vulnerability types.Despite Microsoft’s best efforts to bolster security, Microsoft Exchange remains “a buried treasure with more bugs” lying in wait, Tsai concluded.Hacking humans using AI as a serviceA potential future of AI-assisted social engineering was mapped out during a forward-looking talk at DEF CON.Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) products such as OpenAI's GPT-3 API have made advanced technologies more easily available at a modest cost.Three Singapore-based researchers were able to repurpose personality analysis AIaaS products to generate convincing phishing emails that were based on a target’s social media profile. The task played to the strengths of natural language generators bundled with AIaaS products.For mass targeted phishing emails, human-created content attracted more interaction. But in targeted spear phishing exercises, carried out as part of authorised pen testing exercise, responses to AI-generated phishing emails were higher.It’s not all bad bad news.The researchers outline techniques that might be applied to detecting synthetic texts as well as governance principles AIaaS providers ought to consider adopting.IPVSee youDuring Black Hat, researchers from the Center for Measurement and Analysis of Network Data (CMAND) demonstrated IPVSee You, a privacy disrupting attack that can discover and precisely locate millions of home routers in use across the world.It is described as a “large-scale data fusion attack” that combines EUI-64 IPv6 addresses with Wi-Fi and geolocation data in order to produce IPv6 street-level geolocations.While EUI-64 IPv6 addresses are no longer used by most operating systems, they are commonly found in legacy and low-profit-margin customer premises equipment (CPE), for example commodity routers connecting home and business subscribers.“Because IPv6 CPE are routed hops (as opposed to IPv4 NATs), we can discover their MAC address via traceroute if they use EUI-64,” the researchers explained.Anyone using a ping6 or traceroute6 can find a router’s location with “street-level” precision – aka pinpointing the exact home.Erik Rye, researcher at CMAND, said that they encrypt all of the data that they receive, and publish only the aggregate data analysis rather than the underlying data itself.He added: “It’s worth remembering that our goal here is ultimately to improve privacy protections by highlighting this location.”SleeplessHacking IoT devices was the theme of several talks across Black Hat and DEF CON. For example, researcher Kya Supa discovered a way to hack the room controls in a capsule hotel.The exploit he developed – which relied in part on weak WEP wireless encryption, default credentials on networking kit, and low entropy passwords – allowed him to control the lights, fan, and raise or lower the sofa/bed in other capsule units in a hotel.By programming the changes, Supa was able to turn off and on the lights and turn the bed into a sofa every two hours in a capsule occupied by another (inconsiderate) guest (who had reportedly insisted on talking loudly on his phone at night and ignored requests to be more considerate).The moral? Don’t mess with the sleep of hackers.Over at DEF CON, robot vacuum cleaners were rooted by Dennis Giese. Giese’s hack enabled owners to use their devices safely with open source home automation, avoiding built-in features that automatically uploaded data to the cloud. Hacker Joseph Gabay presented his research on hacking shopping cart immobilisers, a topic he got into basically out of love for a technical challenge and locksmithing.Returning closer to the mainstream, and of particular relevance with more people working from home, hacker Matthew Bryant offered a talk at DEF CON on using Apps Script to exploit G Suite (AKA Google Workspace).Apps Script payloads can be developed to bypass protective controls such as U2F and OAuth app allowlisting. App Scripts run on Google’s infrastructure and therefore present a way to backdoor compromised accounts even if a target changes their machine.Do you like to read? I know how to take over your Kindle with an e-bookOver at DEF CON, Checkpoint researcher Slava Makkaveev demonstrated how he was able to takeover a victim’s Kindle e-reader via a malicious e-book.Kindle, which is made by Amazon, enables users to download books and other documents onto a portable device.Makkaveev showed how he was able to create a malicious book which could be published and made available for free access in any virtual library, including the official Kindle Store, or sent directly to the end-user device via Amazon services.When a Kindle user opens the e-book on their device, hidden code is executed that has root rights.“From this moment on, you [have] lost your e-reader, account, and more,” the researcher commented.Once an attacker has this access, they are able to execute further attacks including by turning the device into a bot to attack other local networks.Tooling upgradeAs ever, the Arsenal track at Black Hat was replete with dozens of new hacking tools and frameworks.

no,The Ripple Effect: How increasing the number of women in the infosec can result in a happier workplace,Women in tech was a key community topic at this year’s Black Hat USA conference,"The issue of diversity in the information security industry was a hot topic at Black Hat USA last week, as more companies look to create a more inclusive workplace.Speaking at the security conference, which was held online and in person this year, Symantec’s Oryan De Paz and Omer Yair shared how the security vendor approaches recruitment while keeping diversity in mind.Yair told attendees that their talk, titled ‘The Ripple Effect: Building a Diverse Security Research Team’, was conceived during the process of Symantec acquiring Javelin Networks, an Israel-based security start-up.Read more of the latest news from Black Hat USASeveral media platforms in Israel had reported on the takeover, sharing a picture of the company which, at the time, was all male.“There were no misogynists, no sexists, or any bad culture on our core team, yet initially it consisted entirely of men,” Yair, endpoint security team lead at Symantec, explained.“We understood that there was an unconscious bias on our team, and we committed to change it.”Yair and his team set about growing the number of female colleagues in their research team, making key changes in the way they recruit employees as well as the way they manage the team on a day-to-day basis.The endpoint security team now consists of 50% female, 50% male staff.Diversity toolboxYair shared some of the “tools” the team developed to enable them to achieve their mission statement.When it came to job applications, Yair said it was important to “measure, and measure again” the resumés they were receiving to ensure they were considering a fair balance of men and women for roles.They took notes from studies on how to increase the number of women who are attracted to a job post, and also contacted various women in tech groups to directly reach their target audience.Work-life balanceAside from growing diversity within new roles, Yair also shared how they committed to fostering a healthy work-life balance within the team.For example, employees are measured on their output rather than time spent working, allowing them to focus on the pace of their work and not how many hours they’re sat behind a desk.They are empowered to set “unavailable” hours on their calendars, during which meetings will not be scheduled.DON’T MISS Respect in Security: New infosec campaign aims to stamp out harassmentWorkers are also encouraged to “step out of their comfort zone” in their role, whether by learning a new skill or another avenue.Yair said: “Those team members that are stepping out of their comfort zone… create another ripple effect because we improve the self-efficacy of the team members, we increase their self confidence and [the level of] professionalism.”The cycle continuesConcluding, Yair said that by increasing diversity within the team, it in turn made for a happier and healthier workplace – one that now attracts a more diverse set of applications.He said: “We started on this journey to increase diversity and that was our vision – our strategy was to increase the quality of inclusion in the workplace, that created a better atmosphere for us, which allowed us to increase the diversity.“When you have a more diverse team and workforce, you can easily create a more, equal, inclusive environment, that [in turn] creates a better atmosphere, and the circle continues.”YOU MAY LIKE Black Hat 2021: Zero-days, ransoms, supply chains, oh my!",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/the-ripple-effect-how-increasing-the-number-of-women-in-the-infosec-can-result-in-a-happier-workplace,"['Black', 'Hat', 'Industry', 'News', 'Events', 'Organizations', 'Research']"
no,‘A whole new attack surface’ – Researcher Orange Tsai documents ProxyLogon exploits against Microsoft Exchange Server,‘Possibly the most severe vulnerability in the history of Microsoft Exchange’,"Hacking maestro Orange Tsai has disclosed much-anticipated technical details related to his Microsoft Exchange exploits at Black Hat USA 2021.A pre-authenticated remote code execution (RCE) flaw that Tsai unearthed in January “might be the most severe vulnerability in the history of Microsoft Exchange,” the security researcher told attendees in a remote address.Patched in March, the flaw was among a quartet of zero-day flaws whose exploitation saw hundreds of thousands of enterprise messaging servers hacked worldwide.After digging deeper into the bug, Tsai realized that “ProxyLogon is not just a single bug, but a ‘whole new attack surface’ to help researchers uncover new vulnerabilities”.RELATED Feds zap Exchange Server backdoors as Microsoft offers patches for further flawsTsai, principal security researcher at Devcore, discovered eight vulnerabilities from this virgin terrain, comprising server-side, client-side and cryptographic bugs. Their potency was amplified when he corralled them into pre-auth RCE chains known as ProxyLogon and ProxyShell, along with ProxyOracle, a plaintext password recovery combo.Successful exploitation could result in an attacker viewing plaintext passwords and executing arbitrary code on Microsoft Exchange Server instances via port 443.Tsai attributes the discovery of such devastating exploits to the fact that, rather than probing for particular flaws, such as logic bugs or code injections, he analyzed the target application from a high-level architectural perspective.“We hope this brings a new paradigm to vulnerability research and inspires more security researchers to look into Exchange Server,” he said.Prime targetMicrosoft Exchange Server is a long-time target of nation-state hackers because corporate mail servers store the confidential secrets of blue chip organizations and government agencies and Microsoft Exchange dominates the market.Despite their criticality, Tsai said he discovered that 400,000 Exchange servers were internet-facing and therefore vulnerable to attack.Read more of the latest news from Black Hat USAHis research centered on a major change implemented in 2013 on Client Access services (CAS), whereby Exchange’s fundamental protocol handler was divided into frontend and backend components.This fundamental architectural change incurred a considerable level of design debt and introduced inconsistencies between contexts, said Tsai.MitigationsIn order to guard against attack, Tsai advised Microsoft Exchange users to keep their systems up to date and ensure they are not internet-facing.Enhancements to the CAS frontend implemented by Microsoft in April 2021, he added, mitigated the authentication part of attack surface and nullified pre-auth attacks.Because “modern problems require modern solutions”, Tsai advised infosec professionals in his concluding remarks to “try to comprehend architectures from [a] higher point of view”.And despite the patches and mitigations introduced by Microsoft, CAS remains an attack surface with rich promise – albeit without pre-auth bugs the results will be less powerful than those achieved with ProxyLogon.RECOMMENDED Black Hat USA: HTTP/2 flaws expose organizations to fresh wave of request smuggling attacksMicrosoft Exchange remains “a buried treasure with more bugs” lying in wait, Tsai believes.However, he warned: “Even if you found a super critical bug like ProxyLogon, [Microsoft] will not reward you any bounty because Exchange server on-prem is out of scope.”The research has undoubtedly further burnished Tsai’s already stellar reputation. The researcher recently triumphed at the 2021 Pwnie Awards for best server-side bug, topped PortSwigger’s Top Web Hacking Techniques list in 2017 and 2018, and became Master of Pwn 2021 at this year’s Pwn2Own.In a related development back in April, the FBI granted government authorities the ability to remove web shells implanted in Microsoft Exchange installations via a pair of different zero days, credited to the National Security Agency, that had since been patched.The unusual court action was necessary since removing web shells constituted interference with a third-party computer and could therefore have otherwise been deemed unlawful.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/a-whole-new-attack-surface-researcher-orange-tsai-documents-proxylogon-exploits-against-microsoft-exchange-server,"['Microsoft', 'Zero-day', 'Black', 'Hat', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Events', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'Authentication', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Asia', 'Industry', 'News', 'Passwords', 'Government']"
no,Black Hat USA: Downgrade attack against Let’s Encrypt lowers the bar for printing fraudulent SSL certificates,German researchers circumvent key web security mechanism,"Security shortcomings in the mechanism used by Let’s Encrypt to validate web domain ownership create a loophole that allow cybercriminals to get digital certificates for domains more easily.A team of researchers led by Haya Shulman, director of the Cybersecurity Analytics and Defences department at the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology in Germany, discovered a hacking technique that allowed them to circumvent Let’s Encrypt domain validation technology.Catch up on the latest encryption-related news and analysisLet’s Encrypt is a non-profit certificate authority that provides domain owners with SSL certificates, which are used to authenticate sites using HTTPS.The organization’s distributed domain validation technology, introduced in February 2020, in response to earlier Border Gateway Protocol-based hijacking attacks, is designed to thwart one form of manipulator-in-the-middle attacks.Shulman and her team showed that the technology was vulnerable to a form of downgrade attack, partly because the way “vantage points select the nameservers in target domains can be manipulated by a remote adversary”.Another weakness of the technology is that vantage points are selected from a small, fixed set of just four cloud-based systems.The research was presented during a session at the Black Hat USA conference on Wednesday (August 5).Fake it ‘til you make itThe downgrade attacks act to undermine a system with “multiple vantage points to multiple nameservers” by reducing it to “multiple vantage points to a single attacker-selected nameserver”. The system is tricked into using a specific nameserver by introducing high latency into connections to other validation nodes.In controlled tests, the researchers found that attackers were able to launch attacks against one in four (24.53%) of domains.An automated off-path attack developed by the researchers and targeting this vulnerable sub-set of domains succeeded in obtaining fraudulent certificates for more than 107,000 domains, around one in 10 (10%) of the one million tested domains.The researchers also evaluated the effectiveness of their attacks against other leading certificate authorities, discovering that the techniques that they had developed had stripped away the security advantages that Let’s Encrypt would otherwise have enjoyed.Let's Encrypt is the only CA using multi-perspective validation but the attack could also offer a means to attack the validation technologies used by other certificate authorities.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE HTTP/2 flaws expose organizations to fresh wave of request smuggling attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/black-hat-usa-downgrade-attack-against-lets-encrypt-lowers-the-bar-for-printing-fraudulent-ssl-certificates,"['Encryption', 'Black', 'Hat', 'Authentication', 'MitM', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'DNS', 'Network', 'Security', 'Germany']"

The CDU shut down the app shortly after the report and notified its users of a possible data leak.But according to a blog post on CCC’s website, “the CDU held out the prospect of legal action” when Wittman reported the vulnerability. Earlier this week, the cybersecurity police sent an email to Wittman and asked for a postal address to send legal documents.The CCC criticized the CDU for being “extremely ungrateful” for the voluntary help and described their move as “shooting the messenger.”A spokesperson for CCC declared that the organization would no longer be reporting vulnerabilities to CDU in light of the episode.RECOMMENDED Researcher launches GoFundMe campaign to fight legal threat over vulnerability disclosureOn August 4, CDU managing director Stefan Hennewig confirmed that the party had reported a data breach to the police but denied accusing Wittman of stealing data.“Our notification is NOT directed against Lilith Wittmann's Responsible Disclosure procedure.

Dradis helps by generating your report rather than having to pull it all together manually.”During her talk, DiDomenico demonstrated a number of new features including multiple Kanban-style methodologies boards, a comments and notification system, and a simplified setup process.Communication hurdlesResearchers without a background in technical writing can often struggle to produce well written vulnerability reports. This has resulted in the creation of a number of different tools to aim to aid the process.Security consultant Andy Gill (@ZephrFish) created a GitHub repo containing multiple documents to help with the write-ups of bug bounty disclosures.Gill told The Daily Swig that one of the biggest hurdles facing infosec researchers is the ability to explain their research to audiences with different levels of understanding.Read more of the latest news from Black Hat USAHe said: “Most researchers will be able to do the technical breakdown, but few will be able to break it down in a digestible manner for those who are less technical.”Gill gave an insight into his three-step process for writing up a vulnerability: introduce, show, discuss.He explained: “Regardless of the intended audience, the main difference will be the level of language used based on the level of understanding of your target audience.“Introduce.

I rather see USBsamurai as a cheaper and open source version of the same family of HID injecting implants for anyone that wants to play with this group of IoOT (Internet of Offensive Things) devices.”Affordable kitThe four key features of USBsamurai are its affordability, open source design, the ability to offer “undetectable” wireless communications and the facility to establish a covert air gap bypass channel.Bongiorni has put together a set of tutorials offering advice to others on how to build their own USBsamurai.As well as demonstrating the utility, Bongiorni’s talk offered actionable countermeasures to prevent and detect attacks, including an overview of how forensics analysis can be used to detect the presence of USB implants.Hardware implants have become a popular attack vector in air-gapped environments such as industrial networks, as infamously evidenced by the 2010 Stuxnet attack on Iranian Uranium enrichment facilities, and the recent ransomware attack that has led to a shutdown in a US natural gas facility.In recognition of this, red-teamers have included hardware implants in their threat modelling when testing the security of industrial facilities.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Black Hat 2021: WARCannon simplifies web-wide vulnerability research",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/bow-to-the-usbsamurai-malicious-usb-cable-leaves-air-gapped-networks-open-to-attack,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Hardware', 'Black', 'Hat', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Privacy', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'OpSec', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Ransomware', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Malware', 'IoT', 'Italy', 'Europe', 'Events', 'Research']"
no,Black Hat USA: HTTP/2 flaws expose organizations to fresh wave of request smuggling attacks,Security researcher James Kettle digs deep into the web stack to reveal some shiny new attack surface,"HTTP/2 specification pitfalls and implementation errors have resulted in some of the world’s biggest tech companies exposing themselves to high-impact web attacks, new research shows.Two years after taking to the Black Hat USA stage to document his exploits in the field of HTTP request smuggling, PortSwigger* security researcher James Kettle is back with a fresh perspective into how this attack vector can also impact HTTP/2 infrastructure.RELATED Black Hat 2021: Zero-days, ransoms, supply chains, oh my!The results are enough to keep sysadmins awake at night, as the researcher demonstrated how desynchronization attacks levied against HTTP/2 systems enabled him to steal secrets from websites running Amazon’s Application Load Balancer, poison every page on Bitbucket, and forced Atlassian to sign every single one of its users out of Jira.Request smuggling reduxTraditional request smuggling uses HTTP header manipulation to send requests in such a way that the backend and frontend systems think the request is a different length.Through splitting the request, an attacker can force servers and clients to spit out reams of secrets, including user data and private keys.BACKGROUND Ancient technique tears a hole through modern web stacks at Black Hat 2019HTTP/2 includes several performance and security advantages over HTTP/1.1. The binary protocol design that replaces HTTP’s plaintext design can help stamp out request smuggling as an attack vector.“HTTP/1 relies on the user sending their Content-Length, or a Transfer-Encoding: chunked header, in order to tell the server what the length of the message is,” Kettle explained during his talk at Black Hat USA today (August 5).“HTTP/2 doesn’t require either of these headers. Instead, the length is built into the frame layer. As a result, it’s impossible to send an HTTP/2 message that is ambiguous about what its length is.”HTTP/2 request smuggling – how is it possible?Given the protocol improvements, one might ask how it is possible to conduct request smuggling attacks with HTTP/2 infrastructure. According to Kettle, the answer stems from the well-worn adage of complexity being the enemy of security.The researcher explained: “Why is HTTP/2 request smuggling possible? Unfortunately, the majority of servers that speak HTTP/2 to the client actually rewrite requests as HTTP/1 in order to talk to the backend server.This behaviour is “ridiculously common”, Kettle said, who added that Amazon’s application load balancer was among the many offending web services.Request smuggling can force servers and clients to leak secretsThis approach – which Kettle calls ‘HTTP/2 downgrading’ – effectively removes all the security benefits that administrators should be getting from using HTTP/2.Attacks in actionIn a technical white paper, HTTP/2: The Sequel is Always Worse, released in tandem with his Black Hat presentation today, Kettle explained how HTTP/2 downgrading attacks enabled him to scoop a $20,000 bug bounty from Netflix.“Netflix was using the Netty Java library for their HTTP/2 support and that library forgot to verify that the Content-Length was correct,” he said.By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could redirect users to their own website, achieve persistent JavaScript execution on Netflix’s core website, or hijack user accounts en masse.Read more about the latest hacking techniquesThe attacks don’t end here: After discovering that AWS’ Application Load Balancer was downgrading connections, Kettle said he could conduct request smuggling attacks on every site that used the load balancer, including a law enforcement portal.Among his other victims was the Incapsula WAF, (web application firewall) the Netlify content delivery network, and Atlassian’s Jira, the latter of which forced a global user sign-out in order to ensure the issue had been mitigated.Also of note was an attack against Bitbucket. The DevOps tool had proved a difficult target for Kettle’s previous exploits, but further research resulted in him being able to take control of every page on the Bitbucket website.James Kettle presented his latest request smuggling research at Black Hat USA 2021Securing the stackIn a world where HTTP/2 is spoken consistently by all systems, most of these request smuggling attacks would fail. In reality, we still have a long way to go.According to W3techs, HTTP/2 is currently supported by just 46% of all websites – and it is not known how many of these conduct downgrading behind the scenes.RELATED H2C smuggling named top web hacking technique of 2020“If you take your frontend server, turn on HTTP/2 support and do downgrading, congratulations: you have just doubled the number of ways that you may be vulnerable to request smuggling,” Kettle warns.As part of his research, Kettle has released an open source tool to help security teams test their own systems for HTTP/2 request smuggling flaws.“The simplest way to avoid these problems on your website is to avoid downgrading,” he told The Daily Swig. “Leave HTTP/2 switched off until you can support it end to end.“HTTP/2 is a beautiful beast, but it is complex – and where there’s complexity, people take shortcuts and things go wrong.”* PortSwigger Web Security is The Daily Swig’s parent company.INTERVIEW Aaron Portnoy – ‘There’s no silver bullet for ransomware or supply chain attacks’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/black-hat-usa-http-2-flaws-expose-organizations-to-fresh-wave-of-request-smuggling-attacks,"['Hacking', 'News', 'Black', 'Hat', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Analysis', 'Europe', 'UK', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Events', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'java', 'JavaScript', 'WAF', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Amazon', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Passwords', 'Authentication']"
no,Black Hat USA 2021: Lessons to learn from the aviation sector after Biden mandates cyber-attack investigatory body,"‘We might not make cyber-attacks as rare as airline disasters, but we can hopefully make them a more manageable problem’","The mooted establishment of a US agency dedicated to investigating cyber-attacks should take lessons from its long-running aviation counterpart, attendees at Black Hat USA heard yesterday.In an executive order issued in May, President Biden called for the creation of a National Cybersecurity Safety Board (NCSB) that would determine the causes of ransomware, supply chain, and other attacks, and offer recommendations for preventing recurrences.The planned body would have an interdisciplinary composition and be co-chaired by government and private sector representatives.‘Past time’Biden’s instruction followed a letter sent to the Wall Street Journal in March in which former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart and chair of Indiana University’s cybersecurity program Scott Shackelford said it was “past time for such a move”.Addressing the subject at Black Hat USA, which is held both virtually and in Las Vegas this year, the pair said the far-reaching SolarWinds hack had exposed shortcomings in the US government’s approach to supply-chain cybersecurity and the inadequacies of “a go-it-alone strategy for cybersecurity risk management”.Hart and Shackelford also outlined the hurdles facing policymakers, and the ways in which the NCSB could be modelled on the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).RECOMMENDED Black Hat 2021: Zero-days, ransoms, supply chains, oh my!Founded in 1967, the NTSB’s prescriptions for improving aviation safety have contributed to a sharp fall in the accident rate since 2001.Hart said the NCSB should also take inspiration from the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) – in particular how recurrent problems “reflect systemic shortcomings” and demand investigations of trends rather than individual events, while rare, surprising incidents require dedicated, in-depth investigations.Towards the boardThe long road leading to Biden’s executive order began, said Shackelford, with the Presidential Decision Directive 63 in 1998, which established sector-specific Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs).Other milestones include reports calling for the creation of something resembling the NCSB (a 1991 Computers at Risk study and a 2014 National Science Foundation report) and the release of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in 2014.Establishing the NCSB itself, said Shackelford, will involve addressing challenges such as industry pushback, and recruiting people with the right mix of skills in the context of a near-zero infosec unemployment rate.Read more of the latest news from Black Hat USA 2021Defining the scope of the body’s remit will also be as difficult as it is critical, he added.“In the second half of 2018 alone, there were more than 40,000 breaches reported under the GDPR scheme. It’s impossible [for a cyber safety board to] investigate all of these attacks,” Shackelford said.There’s also the question of meeting Biden’s 90-day turnaround for releasing an investigation’s findings without jeopardizing their usefulness.Shackleford and Hart recommend setting up additional bodies including a Major Cyber Incident Investigation Board with subpoena powers, a Bureau of Cyber Statistics, and a Cyber Safety Reporting System for reporting near misses.Global cooperationConcluding, Shackelford noted that the NTSB’s success has been underpinned by cooperation with a global network of NTSB equivalents and the ICAO, an international regulatory body.“We need to build on the foundations that are already there, including the dozens of countries using risk management frameworks like NIST or more omnibus approaches like GDPR, to build this consensus around cybersecurity and risk management and the utility of investigatory review boards,” he said.“We might not be able to make cyber-attacks as rare as airline disasters, but we can hopefully make them a more manageable problem.”Added Hart: “Combining the desire to find the perpetrator with the desire to prevent things from happening again will be an interesting mix with no precedent. We will be glad to do what we can at the NTSB to help that mixture work.”RELATED Black Hat USA: Credential leak detection tool Scrapesy aims to reduce incident response times",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/black-hat-usa-2021-lessons-to-learn-from-the-aviation-sector-after-biden-mandates-cyber-attack-investigatory-body,"['Black', 'Hat', 'US', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Government', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Compliance', 'Legal', 'OpSec', 'Ransomware', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'GDPR', 'Secure', 'Development', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Events', 'Organizations']"
no,Black Hat Briefings: Hosted DNS configuration flaws risk leaking corporate network topologies,"AWS Route 53 plugs security hole, but other managed DNS platforms are potentially vulnerable, researchers warn","UPDATED Security researchers have discovered a new class of DNS vulnerability that affects multiple DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers.Researchers from cloud security firm Wiz.io discovered that non-standard implementation of DNS resolvers, when combined with quirks in the provision of DNS services, could lead to information leakage from corporate networks using the affected services.The research was presented during a session at the Black Hat USA conference on Wednesday (August 5).Any cloud provider, domain registrar, and website host who provides DNSaaS could be vulnerable, but providers of DNS and their clients are particularly at risk and shown to be flawed in tests by Wiz.io.Leaking sensitive infoThe complexity of DNS and its multiple implementations prompted Wiz.io to investigate the security of DNS-as-a-Service offerings, including AWS Route 53.To their surprise, the researchers discovered that if they registered a nameserver to itself on AWS Route 53 they saw Dynamic DNS traffic that ought to be restricted to internal networks.Microsoft Windows endpoints reveal sensitive customer information when performing DNS update queries through vulnerable setups. Information potentially exposed includes internal IP addresses, computer names, and external IP addresses.Catch up with the latest DNS-related security news and analysis“Over a few hours of DNS sniffing, we received DNS Updated from 992,597 Windows endpoints from around 15,000 potentially vulnerable companies, including 15 Fortune 500 companies,” Wiz.io reports.Computer names can hint at the role of a user within an organization, while internal IP addresses expose the enterprise network setup. External IP addresses expose the geographic locations of computers.Snooping made easyDuring their Black Hat USA presentation, Wiz.io claimed that the scope and ease of exploitation posed by the vulnerability made “NSA spying as easy as registering a domain”.More specifically, it was possible for anyone to register hosted zones on AWS associated with Route53 name servers, exposing corporate DNS queries as a result.Wiz.io discovered that a large credit union was running a subsidiary in Iran, while a mining firm maintained an office in the Ivory Coast – both apparent violations of the US Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations.RECOMMENDED Black Hat 2021: WARCannon simplifies web-wide vulnerability researchIn addition, internal IPv6 addresses and (worse) NTLM / Kerberos authentication tickets are sometimes exposed.Wiz.io examined six major DNSaaS providers, discovering three were vulnerable to the nameserver registration-based exploit.AWS Route 53 has resolved the issues with its implementation, while the disclosure process remains ongoing between Wiz.io and the other two (as-yet unnamed) providers.Google's services, at least, are in the clear.""Google has blocked related domain names to protect customers from this issue and we have not seen any evidence of malicious abuse on our platform,"" a spokesperson told The Daily Swig.

no,Black Hat 2021: WARCannon simplifies web-wide vulnerability research,‘Even the most resource-constrained researcher can now add web-scale analysis to their arsenal’,"An open source tool that makes grepping the internet for web vulnerabilities simpler, faster, and cheaper was unveiled at Black Hat USA today.Security researchers and bug bounty hunters who unearth novel flaws in web applications, web frameworks, or open source components can use WARCannon to non-invasively test regex patterns across the entire internet for corresponding vulnerability indicators.But this entails the parsing of a daunting volume of data – in the region of hundreds of terabytes.DON’T MISS Black Hat 2021 keynote: Zero-days, ransoms, supply chains, oh my!Parallel processingFed by Common Crawl spiders’ trove of JavaScript, CSS, and other website code, WARCannon tackles this challenge with parallel WARC processing across hundreds of CPU cores, while costs are reduced courtesy of spot fleets and same-region data transfer.As a result, “WARCannon can process multiple regular expression patterns across 400TB in a few hours for around $100”, according to the tool’s GitHub repo.Results are stowed in S3 storage and retrieved at speeds of up to 100Gbps per node.Multiplier effectWARCannon has a multiplier effect on productivity, says tool developer Brad Woodward, who is practice lead for cloud security architecture at Observian.“Digging through a framework, integration, technology, or component to find a vulnerability is really labor intensive,” he told The Daily Swig ahead of his Black Hat Arsenal presentation.Read more of the latest news from Black Hat USA 2021“For researchers whose efforts extend beyond a single application or customer, WARCannon lets them multiply the fruits of these labors by finding similarly vulnerable implementations in the wild.”Woodward suggests that bug bounty hunters could extract the greatest benefit.“Consider a researcher who spends two days finding a vulnerability in one place,” he explains. “They can then plug their findings into WARCannon and turn one vulnerability into five, 500, or 50,000.”Optimizing performanceWoodward says that “integrating custom searches and validations is relatively simple” and executed by many other tools.WARCannon, he said, “is architected around scaling a single version of the code. This means that whatever works locally will work exactly the same with a one-off test or a full campaign.“It’s built to make these ‘small scale’ tests easy, which helps researchers be more confident before they pull the trigger at scale.”READ MORE Blind regex injection: Theoretical exploit offers new means of forcing web apps to spill secretsWoodward also “tightened down the thumbscrews to squeeze out as much performance-per-penny as possible. This took weeks of tweaking knobs and buttons in different permutations until only the most effective approaches remained.“The optimizations here were so great that even the most resource-constrained researcher can now add web-scale analysis to their arsenal.”‘Apache Project for hackers’Woodward says he has no immediate plans for further developing the tool.“That said,” he continues, “I really like the idea of aggregating vulnerability indicators from the community, routinely running campaigns on each new crawl as they become available, and sharing the results with the cybersecurity community. This poses a number of challenges that I don’t have good solutions to just yet (PunkSpider is facing many similar challenges), but I’d love to see something happen in that vein.”After BlackHat, WARCannon will, like two other tools developed by Woodward – NPK and Hirogen – be supported by Porchetta Industries, which Woodward describes as “a sort of Apache Project for Hackers”.He added: “Even if folks can’t contribute in other ways, at least dropping in on [the Porchetta Industries] Discord to share war stories is always appreciated.”RECOMMENDED Hopper – Dropbox researchers develop tool to detect lateral movement attacks against enterprise networks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/black-hat-2021-warcannon-simplifies-web-wide-vulnerability-research,"['Black', 'Hat', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Research', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'GitHub', 'Zero-day', 'Industry', 'News', 'Events', 'JavaScript', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security']"
no,"Black Hat 2021: Zero-days, ransoms, supply chains, oh my!","Stolen zero-days are fueling ‘out-of-control’ supply chain attack problem, warns former cyber-spy","Software supply chain attacks are growing at an alarming pace, in a stark development that upends the delicate balance cybersecurity relies on, infosec luminary Matt Tait told delegates at the Black Hat USA conference today (August 4).During his keynote, Tait (@pwnallthethings) warned that supply chain attacks pose a much greater risk than normal data breaches. The frequency of such events over the last year or so – already high – is likely to increase.Tait cited examples of software supply chain attacks including the Colonial Pipeline breach, the Kaseya ransomware attack, Nobellium (Microsoft Exchange), SolarWinds, and the NSO Pegasus revelations. This can have a “waterfall effect” where a successful attack can become the entry point to attacking a third-party software developer and its customers. “Offense has taken the gloves off,” according to Tait, who argued that the increase in software supply chain attacks is being fuelled by a massive growth in the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities that is “off the charts”.The number of zero-days detected in the wild has rocketed in 2021Money to burnMass exploitation with zero-days has historically been infrequent because ‘burning’ through esoteric flaws as a result of their eventual discovery is both financially costly and a big problem if attacks are attributed and C2 infrastructure needs to be taken down and rebuilt.Tait – whose career includes stints at GCHQ and Google Project Zero – argued that use of stolen zero-days is driving the increase in software supply chain attacks.Stolen zero-day are changing the economics of mass exploitation. That means anyone who makes or handles zero-day code needs to keep them secure, according to Tait. “You are a target,” he warned his fellow security researchers.Bug bounties and exploit chainsTo help secure the software supply chain, the security expert argued that bug bounty programs need to be rethought so that vulnerabilities are disclosed and patched as soon as possible.As it stands, according to Tait, researchers are somewhat incentivized to ‘sit on’ high-impact vulnerabilities in the hope that they may develop this into a ‘full chain’ exploits. While these chains bring with them maximum bounty payouts, every day a zero-day remains unpatched is an opportunity for discovery by another, potentially malicious third party.Strongest linksFixing the problem of supply chain attacks, whatever its root cause, is not going to be easy.Supply chain infections can only be fixed by platform vendors, Tait concluded, arguing that government intervention or regulation will do little to address the problem.The security expert concluded his well-received presentation by citing Certificate Transparency as a promising example of platform vendors tackling a particular issue.The Daily Swig team will be reporting live from Black Hat and DEF CON all this week.

no,Decade-long vulnerability in multiple routers could allow network compromise,Devices using Arcadyan software are at risk,"UPDATED A 12-year-old authentication bypass vulnerability that could allow attackers to compromise networks and devices has been discovered in at least 20 router models, potentially affecting millions of users.Discovered by Evan Grant of Tenable, the critical path traversal flaw is tracked as CVE-2021–20090, with a CVSS of 9.8, and is exploitable by unauthenticated, remote attackers.Grant found the issue, which has been present for at least 12 years, in Buffalo routers, specifically the Arcadyan-based web interface software.Bug huntingIn a blog post, the researcher explained that one of the first things he looks at while analyzing any web application or interface is how it handles authentication.Grant found that the feature bypass_check() was only checking as many bytes as are in bypass_list strings.Grant wrote: “This means that if a user is trying to reach http://router/images/someimage.png, the comparison will match since /images/ is in the bypass list, and the URL we are trying to reach begins with /images/.“The bypass_check() function doesn’t care about strings which come after, such as ‘someimage.png’.“So what if we try to reach /images/../<somepagehere>? For example, let’s try /images/..%2finfo.html. The /info.html URL normally contains all of the nice LAN/WAN info when we first login to the device, but returns any unauthenticated users to the login screen.”Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsGrant was able to exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication, allowing an unauthenticated user to access pages they shouldn’t be able to.Two other vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-20091 and CVE-2021-20092, were found that currently are only known to affect specific Buffalo routers.Grant told The Daily Swig: “CVE-2021-20091 would allow an authenticated attacker (or one leveraging the aforementioned authentication bypass) to gain root access to the device by injecting a line into the router’s configuration file, which enables the telnet service upon reboot.“CVE-2021-20092 allows unauthenticated attackers to read sensitive configuration settings including, for certain models, the admin password to the web interface.”The issue has since been patched in Buffalo WSR-2533DHPL2 devices, prior to and including firmware version 1.02, and WSR-2533DHP3 prior to and including version 1.24.More vulnerable devicesAfter confirming the vulnerability was present in the Buffalo router, Grant said that he discovered it also affected at least 20 other models.“This [vulnerability] appears to be shared by almost every Arcadyan-manufactured router/modem we could find, including devices which were originally sold as far back as 2008,” wrote Grant.Grant said this latest discovery sparks concern around the risk of supply chain attacks, an ever-increasing and serious threat to organizations and technology users.“There is a much larger conversation to be had about how this vulnerability in Arcadyan’s firmware has existed for at least 10 years and has therefore found its way through the supply chain into at least 20 models across 17 different vendors,” Grant wrote.He told The Daily Swig that the vulnerabilities were “fairly easy to discover” and “trivial to exploit. “Consequently, we were surprised they hadn’t been discovered and fixed by the manufacturer or vendors who are selling affected devices over the past decade,” Grant added.MUST READ Four-fold increase in software supply chain attacks predicted in 2021 – report“The authentication bypass vulnerability exists due to a list of folders which fall under a ‘bypass list’ for authentication, and improper validation of the paths being provided, leading to the path traversal. “For most of the devices listed, that means that the vulnerability can be triggered by multiple paths. “The severity of the flaw depends on other vulnerabilities within the device, such as CVE-2021-20091 present in the Buffalo router that grants root access. “At least two different vendors were found to have other vulnerabilities unique to their own devices that an attacker could potentially daisy-chain for further exploitation.”The researcher also noted that this latest disclosure is “an important lesson in how one should approach research on consumer electronics”.He added: “The vendor selling you the device is not necessarily the one who manufactured it, and if you find bugs in a consumer router’s firmware, they could potentially affect many more vendors and devices than just the one you are researching.”This article has been updated to include additional comments from Evan Grant, who discovered the vulnerabilities.RELATED Aaron Portnoy – ‘There’s no silver bullet for ransomware or supply chain attacks’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/decade-long-vulnerability-in-multiple-routers-could-allow-network-compromise,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Hardware', 'Authentication', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'US', 'Network', 'Security', 'North', 'America', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Path', 'Traversal', 'Secure', 'Development']"
no,Vulnerability in dating site OkCupid could be used to trick users into ‘liking’ or messaging other profiles,Miscreants could also potentially see dating profiles of logged-in victims,"A security vulnerability in popular dating site OkCupid meant an attacker could dupe users into unknowingly ‘liking’ or sending messages to other profiles.The flaw, which earned its finder an undisclosed bug bounty reward, has now been patched.Contingent on tricking victims into clicking a malicious link, the feat was achieved by combining a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) bug with a “JSON type confusion” vulnerability, explained Yan Zhu, security engineer at privacy-focused browser Brave, in a blog post.“Obviously you could abuse this in order to match with anyone you could trick into clicking a link, or you could spam the link to a bunch of people to increase your profile’s rankings in whatever mysterious algorithm OkCupid uses to suggest people,” continued Zhu.Catch up on the latest security vulnerability news and analysis“It also occurred to me that if I redirected my website to the CSRF link that automatically sent a message to me, I could see the OkCupid profiles of my website visitors who were logged into okcupid.com, which would make for an intense web analytics tool.”Cunning CasanovaThe researcher studied OkCupid after “checking if websites were sending CSRF tokens alongside requests that require authentication, like sending messages to another user from your account”.She noticed that messages sent on the dating site were sent via POST requests that lacked protective CSRF tokens to https://www.okcupid.com/1/apitun/messages/send with a JSON-encoded body.Zhu then created a webpage that, after some trial and error, successfully sent a cross-origin POST request to OkCupid’s message-sending endpoint on the third attempt.She tested the exploit against friends who had active OkCupid profiles, explaining that: “Lo and behold, my OkCupid test profile was serenaded by a series of messages that they didn’t mean to send me.”Zhu joked: “I briefly felt very popular, which made it all worthwhile.”OkCupid, which was alerted to the flaw during April 2021, told the researcher that it had promptly fixed the flaw.Interrogate your inputsZhu also investigated whether other sites’ authenticated endpoints similarly accepted POSTs with content-type: text/plain, despite expecting JSON.Of 215 endpoints associated with Alexa’s top 500 sites that sought requests containing api or json, 87 failed to return errors, with many apparently returning JSON responses.“Granted most of these are probably not authenticated endpoints and some of them may need to accept non-JSON text, but this suggests to me that developers should be careful accepting text/plain inputs on endpoints that parse JSON,” concluded Zhu.Regardless, however, she also noted that setting your browser’s SameSite cookie attribute to ‘Strict’ effectively prevents this, most other CSRF attacks.The Daily Swig has contacted OkCupid for further comment.

no,"Security researcher finds dangerous bug in Chromium, nabs $15,000 bounty",Site isolation security break uncovered,"A newly fixed bug in the Chromium project allowed malicious parties to inject code in embedded site pages, even if these resources were isolated from the parent website.A proof of concept provided by the security researcher who first reported the issue shows an attacker-controlled website exploiting the bug to change the contents of an embedded website, even though the target and destinations exist on separate domains.Catch up on the latest browser security news and analysisAccording to a thread recently made public on the Chromium website, the bug could be exploited even when “site isolation” is enabled on the browser. Site isolation is a security feature that puts each website in a separate process in order to improve security.According to the researcher, the inter-process communication of isolated processes contained a race condition, an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in systems that must complete a task in multiple steps. If there’s a short window of time in-between execution steps where the system is vulnerable, the attacker can exploit the security weakness to make harmful changes.In the case of the Chromium project, an attacker could use a race condition attack to tamper with data buffers shared between the isolated processes of a parent and embedded websites.This vulnerability could eventually enable attackers to inject malicious code into embedded pages or steal sensitive information from users, among other exploits.The security flaw was reported in late March and patched by the end of April. The Google Vulnerability Rewards Program awarded the security researcher $15,000 for the discovery.The flaw has been described as a “site isolation break because of double fetch of shared buffer”.Commented on the finding, a spokesperson for Google told The Daily Swig, “We always appreciate working with the research community through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, and thanks to this report we were able to patch the issue in Chrome 90.”RELATED Google charts progress in developing Site Isolation browser technology",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-researcher-finds-dangerous-bug-in-chromium-nabs-15-000-bounty,"['Google', 'Chrome', 'browser', 'security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Bug', 'Bounty']"
no,Four-fold increase in software supply chain attacks predicted in 2021 – report,EU study warns of growing trend where one attack can leave countless organizations vulnerable,"The European Union has forecast there will be four times more software supply chain attacks in 2021 than there were in 2020, as cybercriminals shift to larger, cross-border targets.The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity – also known as ENISA – has published a new study analyzing the anatomy of a supply chain attack following a number of high-profile incidents in recent months.The report (PDF), titled ‘Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks’, looked at 24 such incidents that have occurred between January 2020 and July 2021.One for all, all for oneAmong the findings, ENISA revealed that around 50% of the supply chain attacks studied were attributed to know APT groups, while 42% were not attributed to a particular source.The study also determined that the attackers’ main motivations lay in gaining access to source code and customer data.Read more of the latest news and analysis about supply chain attacksThe EU-funded study came in the wake of two major cyber-attacks that have made headline news in the past 12 months.Firstly, the SolarWinds incident saw attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in IT software Orion, which was used to manage servers at organizations including various arms of the US government, threat response firm FireEye, and Microsoft.The attacks – which may have begun as early as March 2020 but were only detected in December that year – have been linked to Russian state-sponsored threat group APT29 (AKA ‘Cozy Bear’).MUST READ Kaseya denies ransomware payment as it hails ‘100% effective’ decryption toolMore recently, the notorious REvil ransomware gang exploited known vulnerabilities in IT management platform Kaseya VSA, compromising an estimated 1,000 organizations that use the software.The group demanded a $70 million ransomware payment, which Kaseya denied it has paid.The ENISA report reads: “Unfortunately, these two examples are not isolated cases and the number of supply chain attacks has been steadily increasing over the last year.“This trend further stresses the need for policymakers and the security community to devise and introduce novel protective measures to address potential supply chain attacks in the future and to mitigate their impact.”Known incidentsA timeline of the events in the study details the level of impact from these incidents and identifies those thought to have been behind the attacks.A timeline of the attacks studied in the reportThe report stated that 66% of supply chain attacks were committed by exploiting an unknown vulnerability, while 16% leveraged known software flaws.When it came to supplier assets, most attacks during the specified timeline aimed to compromise code (66%), followed by data (20%) and processes (12%).As for customer assets, supply chain attacks most commonly targeted customer data (58%), followed by key people (16%) and financial resources (8%).Classifying casesThe report’s authors also proposed introducing a taxonomy – a scheme of classification – for mapping supply chain attacks by identifying what has happened, and how.It takes into account the supplier and the customer, pinpointing what assets were targeted and what techniques were used to gain access.The report's authors proposed a taxonomy for supply chain attacks“For each of these four distinguishing elements in the taxonomy, we have defined the elements that better characterize a supply chain attack,” the report states.“By selecting the corresponding elements, it is possible to have a better understanding of what is known or not known about an attack.”The authors also noted that the taxonomy is “conceptually different” from the Mitre ATT&CK framework, and aims to complement rather than replace it.Serious riskThe report’s authors concluded that the recent shift towards supply chain attacks is likely to significantly increase the cybersecurity threat this year. Four times more supply chain attacks are expected to take place in 2021 than in 2020.“The inherent global nature of current supply chains increases the potential impact of these attacks and broadens the attack surface for malicious actors.”Also increasing the risk is the fact that a large number of attack vectors (66%) in the incidents investigated still remain unknown.“A lack of transparency or the ability to investigate poses a serious risk to the trust of the supply chain,” wrote the authors, adding that “improving the process of transparency and accountability is the first step to improving the security of all elements in the supply chain and protecting final customers”.Finally, the report recommends that EU member states “establish good practices” and coordinated actions “to reach a common level of security”.ANALYSIS Aaron Portnoy – ‘There’s no silver bullet for ransomware or supply chain attacks’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/four-fold-increase-in-software-supply-chain-attacks-predicted-in-2021-report,"['Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Europe', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Government', 'Organizations', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Cybercrime', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Malware', 'Ransomware', 'Analysis', 'Microsoft', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Industry', 'News', 'Enterprise', 'Zero-day']"
no,Data breach class actions: US Supreme Court decision may tilt the odds in favor of defendant organizations,"TransUnion opinion raises bar for bringing federal class action lawsuits – but state courts offer breach victims a more viable alternative route, writes David Oberly","COMMENT Corporate defendants besieged by proliferating bet-the-company privacy and consumer class action lawsuits recently scored a victory in the US Supreme Court with implications for data breach victims.The court’s opinion in TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez raises the bar plaintiffs must surmount in order to pursue litigation in federal court in the absence of any tangible, real-world injury.RELATED US court offers clarity on evaluating ‘future risk’ injuries in data breach class action litigationMoving forward, defendants will have broader powers to secure the dismissal of lawsuits filed in federal court alleging only a future risk of harm or injury. Moreover, plaintiffs will be precluded from filing suits for bare statutory, procedural violations due to the inability to establish Article III standing under such circumstances.With that said, plaintiffs may be able to avoid the roadblocks created by the TransUnion case by filing suit in state courts, where the threshold for establishing standing is much lower.Overview of Article III standing‘Standing’ refers to the right to bring a lawsuit in federal court. To establish standing under Article III of the US Constitution, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) an injury-in-fact; (2) causation; and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.The first element underpins most consumer and privacy class action lawsuits. An injury-in-fact must be “concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent”.If a plaintiff alleges only an increased risk of future harm, the potential injury must be deemed impending or there must be a perceived substantial risk of the harm transpiring for standing to exist.MUST READ Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: What the recent Van Buren ruling means for security researchersTransUnion backgroundSome 8,185 TransUnion customers brought suit against the US credit reporting agency for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) after alerts were added to their credit files indicating that their name was a “potential match” to a name on the US Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) list of terrorists, drug traffickers, and other serious criminals.Only 1,853 of these individuals had their credit reports disseminated to third parties when containing OFAC alerts.The question before the court was whether class members had Article III standing to assert their FCRA claims. That question focused on the Article III requirement that a plaintiff’s injury be “concrete” – that is, “real, and not abstract”.Supreme Court opinionThe Supreme Court held that only those 1,853 class members whose allegedly injurious reports were disseminated to third parties had suffered a concrete harm sufficient to constitute a cognizable injury-in-fact that conferred standing.The court reasoned that the class members who had their reports distributed to third parties were able to establish standing because their injury possessed a “close relationship” to a harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts – namely, the reputational harm associated with the tort of defamation.Read more of the latest cybersecurity policy and legislation newsThese TransUnion plaintiffs were essentially labeled as potential terrorists, drug traffickers, or serious criminals as a result of their credit reports containing the OFAC alerts being shared with third parties.The court concluded that this injury was sufficiently related to the harm that arises when a defamatory statement that subjects an individual to hatred, contempt, or ridicule is relayed to a third party.Conversely, the court reasoned that because publication is “essential to liability” in a defamation suit, the mere existence of inaccurate information – absent dissemination – falls short of constituting a concrete injury for purposes of standing.Implications for data breach class actionsThe TransUnion opinion is a big win for defendants, especially those involved in class action litigation. First and foremost, the decision significantly increases the requirements for plaintiffs to establish Article III standing to sue in federal court.Where plaintiffs do not allege any type of intangible harm traditionally associated with a common law tort, defendants should now be able to assert successful standing challenges and can point to the TransUnion opinion as persuasive support for this argument.Furthermore, the mere risk of future harm alone is no longer sufficient to confer standing. This is particularly significant in the context of data breach class action litigations, where suits are often filed in the immediate aftermath of a cyber-attack even where no actual harm – in the form of identity theft or fraud – has yet occurred.At the same time, the ruling also places additional limitations on claimed “informational injuries”, which are commonly alleged in class actions where damages are tenuous. Here, the court held that an “asserted informational injury that causes no adverse effects cannot satisfy Article III”. After TransUnion, where no subsequent type of harm is shown, the mere alleged deprivation of information alone cannot establish standing.With that said, the TransUnion ruling may ultimately turn out to be a hollow victory for corporate defendants. The decision may have the unintended consequence of funneling future class action suits into state court venues where the bar for establishing standing – while varied – is generally much lower than its federal counterpart.RELATED Tsao vs. Captiva – How a data breach court case could have a major impact on the definition of ‘harm’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/data-breach-class-actions-us-supreme-court-decision-may-tilt-the-odds-in-favor-of-defendant-organizations,"['Legal', 'US', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Privacy', 'Analysis', 'North', 'America', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Organizations', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Critical flaws in TransLogic Pneumatic Tube System could see attackers sabotage hospital operations,"Vendor Swisslog Healthcare urges more than 3,000 hospitals worldwide to apply patch ASAP","UPDATED Attackers who exploit critical security vulnerabilities in Swisslog Healthcare’s TransLogic Pneumatic Tube System (PTS) could potentially reroute or shut down the automated delivery of medications and other vital items around hospitals.Swisslog Healthcare has urged healthcare facilities to update their systems after releasing a firmware update today (August 2) that addresses all but one of nine flaws discovered by researchers from cybersecurity firm Armis.TransLogic PTS is used in more than 80% of North American hospitals and more than 3,000 healthcare facilities worldwide, according to Swisslog.The system transports medications, blood products, lab samples, and test results around facilities within cylindrical containers via a network of pneumatic tubes.‘PwnedPiper’The vulnerabilities were found in the Nexus Control Panel, which powers all Translogic PTS stations.Dubbed ‘PwnedPiper’, the vulnerabilities “can enable an unauthenticated attacker to take over Translogic PTS stations and essentially gain complete control over the PTS network of a target hospital”, reads a blog post published by Armis.From there, attackers could launch denial-of-service attacks, ransomware attacks, or manipulator-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that redirect carriers containing vital medical items.TransLogic PTS can also transport urgent items at comparatively high speeds and sensitive items, such as blood products, more slowly.“If an attacker were to compromise the PTS system, he may alter the system’s speed restrictions, which can in turn damage such sensitive items,” warns Armis.Prolonged shutdownThe most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-37160), which Armis said remains unpatched, could see an attacker achieve remote code execution (RCE) and maintain persistence on the target device after initiating a firmware update procedure.This is possible because a design flaw means firmware upgrades lack encryption, authentication, and cryptographic signature mechanisms.Remediating such an attack with manual firmware upgrades “will take considerable time and effort”, notes Armis, and many hospitals lack contingency plans for handling a prolonged shutdown of PTS systems.RECOMMENDED Dropbox researchers develop tool to detect lateral movement attacks against enterprise networksThe threat is exacerbated further by the system’s integration with other hospital systems such as Swisslog’s WhoTube access control system.In exploiting four memory corruption vulnerabilities in the TLP20 control protocol (CVE-2021-37161, CVE-2021-37162, CVE-2021-37165, CVE-2021-37164), an attacker could potentially achieve RCE, and thereafter harvest employees’ RFID credentials.They could also perform reconnaissance on the PTS network, seize control of all Nexus stations, and “hold them hostage in a sophisticated ransomware attack,” said Armis.The vulnerabilities also include two privilege escalation flaws arising from hardcoded passwords (CVE-2021-37163 and CVE-2021-37167), and a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2021-37166).Patch nowArmis alerted Swisslog Healthcare to the vulnerabilities on May 1, 2021.With the researchers’ help, Swisslog has released firmware version 7.2.5.7 and mitigations in security advisories addressing each flaw.All previous firmware versions are susceptible to the flaws.Armis says it expects CVE-2021-37160 to be patched in a future release.Jennie McQuade, chief privacy officer for Swisslog Healthcare, told The Daily Swig: “Armis has offered a tremendous depth of research which has, in turn, helped us to deliver an enhanced solution for our customers. Our latest software release eliminates the identified vulnerabilities except for one, for which mitigation strategies are recommended.“We will continue to hold security as a top-tier priority in order to collaborate with our customers on operational technology within the hospital.”Catch up on the latest healthcare breaches and security newsArmis says PTS systems have hitherto been overlooked by security researchers despite the critical role they play in healthcare settings.“Understanding that patient care depends not only on medical devices, but also on the operational infrastructure of a hospital is an important milestone to securing healthcare environments,” said Nadir Izrael, co-founder and CTO at Armis.Armis security researchers Ben Seri and Barak Hadad will present the PwnedPiper research at Black Hat USA later this week.Armis, whose flagship product is an agentless device security platform, has also published a technical white paper (PDF) on the research.This article was updated on August 3 with comments from Swisslog Healthcare.RELATED UC San Diego Health discloses data breach after employee email accounts hijacked",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/critical-flaws-in-translogic-pneumatic-tube-system-could-see-attackers-sabotage-nbsp-hospital-operations,"['Healthcare', 'Hardware', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'IoT', 'Network', 'Security', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'MitM', 'RCE', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Authentication', 'Encryption', 'Passwords', 'Secure', 'Development', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Ransomware', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Zero-day']"
no,"UK universities awarded funding for research into IoT, smart home security","Academics say that smart technology is a ‘balancing act’, and that consumers need to be aware of the risks","A number of British universities have been awarded a grant to explore the security issues surrounding Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home devices, as well as to determine ways to warn consumers of the risks.Announced on July 13, the ‘PrivIoT’ project, led by Dr James Nicholson, a lecturer at Northumbria University’s Computer and Information Sciences department, will also involve academics from Royal Holloway, Manchester, and Nottingham universities.The grant was awarded by the PETRAS National Centre of Excellence, an organization focused on the social and technical aspects of deploying IoT into the consumer sphere.In total, £3.6 million has been awarded to 18 projects, including digital twin frameworks, bias in female-oriented technologies, and securing IoT in the utilities sector.The projectPrivIoT is consumer focused, with an emphasis on understanding the privacy and security implications of IoT, smart home, and smart energy devices offered to consumers, as well as the potential creation of an interface or other means to give users more control over their personal security.In an interview with The Daily Swig, Nicholson, together with Dr David Buil-Gil, a lecturer in Quantitative Criminology at the Department of Criminology of the University of Manchester, said the 18-month project will focus on understanding what the potential harms of IoT in the home.Read more of the latest news about IoT securityThere are three ‘strands’ to the project – the initial area of study will be understanding potential risks associated with what could be considered “future” technologies that, while in existence, have not yet been fully developed, implemented, or rolled out nationwide.Led by Buil-Gil and Manchester University, this aspect will include analysis of studies already conducted on IoT and the potential creation of classification standards, as well as an examination of which technologies could act as a counterbalance for risks to privacy or security.Buil-Gil said risk factors vary but may include blackmail, the theft of private data, such as audio recordings or images harvested from a smart home by compromising an intelligent device, ransomware, and other forms of cyber-attacks.Energy devices are also of interest to the researchers and whether or not the “trade-off” between saving money and being more energy efficient while potentially sacrificing security is worth it.RELATED Research exposes vulnerabilities in IP camera firmware used by multiple vendorsThe UK government is pushing for businesses and home users to permit smart meter installations on the grounds of reducing carbon emissions. However, there are already some security concerns surrounding these devices including patterns of use, device hijacking, and house occupancy monitoring.When it comes to web security, the team may also examine issues surrounding IoT botnets and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks as use cases.“The most secure state you can be in is to not use a device connected to the internet, but at some point, you’ve got to make that call as to whether the practical benefits outweigh any potential risk – and what we’re trying to do here is try things in a different way,” Nicholson says.This is where Northumbria comes in: once an understanding of the risks has been established, the team will work on ways to “communicate these risks to citizens”.“How can we get citizens involved in these discussions?” Nicholson said. “We know that now, as it has been in the past, people do not generally or openly discuss security or privacy issues.“When it comes to adopting technologies, including IoT, essentially [by the] time they understand the risks of these technologies… they’ve already started using them.”Risk factorIn past years, security failings and risks in IoT products have become apparent after they have been made available. Now, the team hopes to get ahead of the curve and ensure consumers are more risk-aware, with risk factors addressed proactively, rather than reactively.In the final stage of the project, led by Dr Stefanie Kuenzel from Royal Holloway and Nottingham University, the team will collate their previous findings to create interfaces to “allow users to take initiative and try and protect themselves”, according to Nicholson.This will include developing systems able to give consumers a visual glance of what is going on in their home – and to “do something” about any security issues.”I think it’s a two-way process as well,” Nicholson commented. “We can’t expect everyone to fully understand this technology and all the interactions, and to be able to make fully informed decisions on everything.“There has to be an onus on having technologies that are secure and that are privacy-preserving, but at the same time, as end users, we need to have enough basic awareness.”The first phase of the research is underway, which will include study analysis and data collection. Researchers will be hired to help with the data collection stage, and companies including Toshiba, OTASKI Energy Solutions, and CybSafe will also be participating in the project.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE IoT security: Researchers discover Stem Audio smart speaker eavesdropping risk",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/uk-universities-awarded-funding-for-research-into-iot-smart-home-security,"['IoT', 'Research', 'Education', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Privacy', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Industry', 'News', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'DDoS', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service']"
no,Bug Bounty Radar // The latest bug bounty programs for August 2021,New web targets for the discerning hacker,"This month, we asked security pros what they thought about China’s new vulnerability disclosure law, which requires researchers to hand over information on vulnerabilities, including zero-days, to the authorities.Frank Downs, director of proactive services at BlueVoyant, suggested that Chinese researchers were likely to tread much more carefully, while Joseph Carson, chief security scientist at ThycoticCentrify, said it could impact companies doing development work within China.Other observers have suggested that that the rules could limit legitimate security research and allow the Chinese military and intelligence agencies to “stockpile” vulnerabilities for future use.In bug bounty program news, Yearn Finance, the decentralized finance protocol, has launched a bug bounty program promising payouts of between $20,000 and $200,000 for critical vulnerabilities.Meanwhile, loyalty management tech firm Antavo has set up a bug bounty program on European crowdsourced security platform Hacktify, offering up to €240 ($283) for qualifying security flaws.See below for more information on these two new programs and more.At the other end of the coordinated disclosure process, Microsoft says its own bug bounty program has awarded a whacking $13.6 million to security researchers over the past 12 months.The biggest payout was $200,000, for the discovery of vulnerabilities in the company's Hyper V technolgy, with the average around $10,000.And there was a big reward for newbie security researcher Augusto Zanellato, who netted $50,000 after discovering a GitHub access token that gave access to Shopify repos.Finally, we spoke to Estonian infosec expert Oliver Sild about his new platform Patchstack.

no,Dropbox researchers develop tool to detect lateral movement attacks against enterprise networks,‘Hopper’ delivered better detection and much reduced false alarms in early tests,"Hopper, a tool developed by researchers at Dropbox, UC Berkeley, and other organizations, offers a different approach to finding malicious activity in enterprise networks.Introduced ina paper that will be presented at the Usenix Security Symposium next month, Hopper uses machine learning to detect lateral movement attacks while reducing the number of false security alarms, the latter of which remains a key downside to existing approaches.Lateral movementMany data breaches and security incidents at enterprises start with a simple device or low-privileged user account getting compromised. Attackers then move beyond their initial point of entry to other machines and administrator-level user accounts, gaining access to more valuable servers and resources as they progress.This process is known as “lateral movement” and is a telltale sign of an impending security disaster.Spotting the difference between normal user activity and malicious lateral movement is challenging. Prior approaches to detecting the difference involved specifying detailed network activity rules or making use of anomaly detection algorithms.In their paper, the developers of Hopper note that these tools either fail to detect subtle lateral movement attacks or cause false positives and trigger alarms against normal logins.“Unfortunately, the scale of modern enterprises inherently produces large numbers of anomalous-but-benign logins, causing traditional anomaly detection to generate too many false alarms,” the researchers explain.HopperHopper is a tool that analyzes an enterprise’s login records to find signs of possible lateral movement attacks. The utility uses two key components: a causality engine that traces login paths and a scoring algorithm that decides which login paths have the characteristics of lateral movement attacks.Catch up with the latest network security newsHopper has been designed on the basis that lateral movement attacks have two key characteristics: Attackers seek to access a server that their original victim would not have access to, and to do so, they will need to hack privileged accounts such as sysadmins.By filtering and examining login paths based on these two vectors, Hooper can determine which activities need further investigation.The researchers tested Hopper on 15 months of data from Dropbox’s enterprise network, composed of more than 780 million login events that included 326 simulated attacks by a red team.The tool was able to detect 94.5% of attacks while producing eight times fewer false alarms than other lateral movement detection tools.Simple rulesWhile there’s much excitement in the security industry about using deep learning to detect network intrusions, the developers of Hopper used basic statistical models and very simple rules to filter out benign login paths and identify suspicious activity.READ MORE Machine learning security vulnerabilities are a growing threat to the web, report highlights“We are using a more manual anomaly detection approach, that blends manual rules with statistical anomaly detection,” Grant Ho, Ph.D. candidate in computer science, UC Berkeley, a member of the research team that developed Hooper, told The Daily Swig.“There is a lot of excitement about deep learning right now, but for security purposes where you have extreme class imbalances and no labeled data, deep learning is often the wrong tool to use.”Ho said that while Hopper has been trained on data from the Dropbox network, it should work just as well for other organizations because the basic rules of lateral movement remain consistent across enterprise networks and different attacks.“Each new enterprise should train Hopper on their own network's data, but unlike traditional machine learning models Hopper doesn't have any hyper-parameters that need tuning; an organization only needs to specify how many alerts for lateral movement it would like to see, and the rest of Hopper can run without parameter tuning,” he said.Ho believes Hopper can potentially become a good complement to other enterprise security tools.“Right now, organizations have a dizzying array of EDR and host-based protection products, but there aren't very good defensive tools for understanding the movement between machines on your network,” he said. “Hopper tries to fill in this missing gap by allowing organizations to identify particularly suspicious movement that occurs between internal hosts.”Security hygieneHopper won’t replace the need for good security hygiene in enterprise networks. For example, if network administrators expose their sensitive resources and accounts onto the internet, attackers will be able to compromise them without the need for lateral movement.In such cases, neither Hopper nor any other lateral movement-detection tools would help.“We view Hopper as part of a defense-in-depth strategy that emphasizes good least privilege practices, where the goal is to reduce the chance that an arbitrary compromised account leads to a successful breach of sensitive systems or data,” Ho concluded.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Dozens of web apps vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning via ‘forgot password’ feature",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/dropbox-researchers-develop-tool-to-detect-lateral-movement-attacks-against-enterprise-networks,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Network', 'Security', 'Enterprise', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Analysis', 'Research', 'Authentication', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'Organizations', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Events', 'Retail']"
no,Aaron Portnoy – ‘There’s no silver bullet for ransomware or supply chain attacks’,"‘We don’t have the luxury of starting over’, offensive security specialist warns in wide-ranging interview","INTERVIEW Aaron Portnoy confesses to periodic bouts of imposter syndrome, despite having carved out a distinguished career in offensive security.Among other things, Portnoy – now principal scientist at attack surface management specialists Randori – has interned at one of the first traffickers of zero-days (iDefense), founded his own company (Exodus Intelligence), headed up the Zero-Day Initiative’s research team, and launched the very first Pwn2Own contest in 2007.Speaking to The Daily Swig, the security pro reflects on the dramatic changes he’s witnessed in the industry, and offers some prescriptions for keeping pace with increasingly sophisticated attackers.Please tell us about your current role…Aaron Portnoy: I enable our attack team to give customers a nation state-like experience – improving our product with new discovery and attack techniques, discovering and weaponizing zero-days…I also do presentations, blog posts, and technical analysis and try to put the attackers’ perspective on recent bugs and so forth.How and why did you get into hacking?AP: I first got into offensive security when I was about 14 or 15 years old. Your parents tell you not to talk to strangers on the internet – I wouldn’t be here if I hadn’t talked to professionals [online] who pointed me in the right direction.I started out with open source stuff like FreeBSD and some Unix flavors, then moved on to Linux. Once I realized I could look at all of the code, it evolved into a fascination with breaking through security boundaries.I started getting obsessed with offensive security and writing exploits, specifically reverse engineering. Then the industry kind of grew up around me and I got to pursue this professionally.RECOMMENDED Interview: Patchstack’s Oliver Sild on securing WordPress, one plugin vulnerability at a timeI focused on reverse engineering and exploit discovery because it was, in my opinion, one of the more difficult things.I want to get into targets that no one else has – which was reflected in [why I launched the] Pwn2Own contest.What did Pwn2Own bring to the world of vulnerability discovery?AP: It was an awareness campaign at first: people outside our industry just weren’t aware of these capabilities.It had some key milestones throughout the first five years, moving from laptops and browsers to mobile phones, and then we did it in Tokyo as a Mobile Pwn2Own.The very first Pwn2Own, I was sitting there with a picnic table with a bunch of cash from the company to give away. We bought a laptop from BestBuy down the street – it was very unstructured.RELATED Pwn2Own 2021: Zero-click Zoom exploit among winners as payout record smashedWhen we first launched, you had individuals winning the contest. Now, we’re getting to a stage where you actually need teams to compete.Since I left [the Pwn2Own organizing team], it’s ballooned into a worldwide event with Teslas and all these different things. It’s more of a show these days, but probably still valuable.But I do think in the early days it was more innovative and pivotal in changing the perspective and general understanding of zero-days and vulnerabilities.Pwn2Own has become a hugely popular live hacking eventWhat are the most innovative or interesting areas in vulnerability research right now?AP: Speculative execution vulnerabilities and anything that involves you not being able to trust your hardware the way you think you do are really interesting.The Internet of Things or embedded devices will have serious effects in the long term. Having your refrigerator network-connected is probably not the best idea.As an attacker, SCADA systems or industrial control systems are the most tempting targets when people running those systems have no way of looking at the system logs or logging in. With a root shell on there I could hide forever and they’ll never know I was there.How big a contribution do bug bounties make to infosec?AP: A lot of the bug bounty space seems to be web app-specific or specific to a given customer. If PayPal wants you to audit their website, it’s very specific to that vendor, and that irks me. That’s just glorified quality assurance.A bug bounty against a product with a large installed base would be way more valuable. But we’re in a gig economy. This is the trend in which labor is moving.I think [bug bounty] is a great opportunity for people in countries where it’s more difficult to get into the tech space. I’ve seen people outside of the US and Europe make a lot of money doing this and that's great.The only warning I would give [to vendors] is that it should be a piece of what you are doing, but it shouldn't be your entire defensive strategy.How confident are you that the government, businesses, and the infosec industry are getting any sort of handle on how to deal with supply chain attacks?AP: The analogy of ‘you’re only as strong as your weakest link’ comes to mind.The size of the dependency graph for a given piece of software is so massive that there’s no way to ever validate every single developer who has access to every project.You deal with that problem generically by basic blocking and tackling. You should design your network segmentation, have user-based access control, separate data from access to contain [risk], monitor for anomalies, separate controls…So, I don’t think there’s going to be any silver bullet for supply chain attacks.The recent breaches have occurred in software that is responsible for managing your network, but software by its very nature needs to have access to a wide range of things over a lot of security boundaries.I think there are analogies with ransomware. People want a silver bullet, but ransomware is really just the end of a long attack chain: they’ve compromised your external perimeter, gotten into your internals, pivoted, got credentials, then at the very end they monetize it with ransomware.The way to defend against that is stop them at the perimeter.Software supply chain attacks have become a hot topic in 2021Are security vulnerabilities destined to become even more prolific and damaging as the ecosystem becomes more sophisticated and the attack surface grows?AP: Every year I have a bit of an impostor syndrome, where I’m an old dinosaur looking for memory corruption bugs, and I stave that off by finding some really crucial, high-severity vulnerability.As the industry grows at an exponential rate, I don’t think we have matured as far as we should from a code production standpoint.Just look at the CVEs from the last decade – it’s just going up and up. There’s more and more code being put out there, more and more technical debt accruing.We don’t have the luxury of burning down the internet and starting over. I don’t see it getting any easier.Does this make the timing of vulnerability disclosures more difficult than ever?AP: At Randori we want to give our customers a nation-state experience with real zero-days so they can validate their controls. To do that, we need to withhold disclosure for a time, to give them that experience. Is this being actively exploited in the wild? Do we feel responsibility to disclose? There’s no easy answer.It’s a double-edged sword. You have to strike a balance between protecting users at large and making sure you’re not enabling attackers to run rampant with a given capability.Read more of the latest infosec interviewsThe theme tends to be that attackers move a lot quicker than defenders.There were like 18,000 vulnerabilities in 2020. How are they supposed to know which ones they need to prioritize and patch?President Biden has, on the face of it, been fairly proactive on the cybersecurity front – is he on the right track?AP: The administration is making good steps insofar as bringing it to light, starting initiatives, hiring a new CISA director, and getting a conversation started with various other nation states about what we’re going to do about this. I think more funding will be beneficial in the long run.We need to ensure that everyone is thinking about these things in the right way, and not sticking a random piece of hardware on their perimeter and trusting it to solve all their problems.No matter what fancy adjective you put in front of it, it’s really just another bit of attack surface.I do like that it’s being discussed more. It’s really kind of surreal to hear about our industry being opined on from the White House – that’s actually pretty crazy considering where we were 10 years ago.The US government, in particular, has quite a perspective on what’s happening on the internet and has a lot of information they don’t necessarily share as much as they should or could.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/aaron-portnoy-theres-no-silver-bullet-for-ransomware-or-supply-chain-attacks,"['Interviews', 'Zero-day', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Ransomware', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Research', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'Mobile', 'OpSec', 'US', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Government', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Events', 'North', 'America', 'VDP', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Europe', 'Analysis']"

Many of these are educational institutions such as universities or colleges.The bug, a PHP object injection vulnerability in Moodle’s Shibboleth authentication module, could allow unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution (RCE), resulting in a complete compromise of the server.In turn, this could allow them complete access to anything on the target server, including personally identifiable information such as password hashes, exam grades, and messages.Pre-auth RCEThe flaw was discovered by Robin Peraglie and Johannes Moritz, penetration testers by trade, who chose to hunt for bugs in Moodle due to previously having found two other RCE vulnerabilities in the software.Moritz told The Daily Swig that the vulnerability is only present in Moodle LMS server which has Shibboleth single sign-on authentication enabled.

no,DDoS attacks recede in Q2 as cryptocurrency price drops,Quiet before the storm?,"The second quarter of this year was accompanied by a welcome lull in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack activity.The total number of DDoS attacks decreased by 38.8% in Q2 2021 compared to the same period last year. The volume of incidents year-on-year was also down 6.5%, according to the latest DDoS trends report by Kaspersky.“The overall situation in Q2 was relatively calm,” according to Kaspersky. “On average, the number of DDoS attacks fluctuated between 500 and 800 per day.”The security firm added: “On the quietest day, only 60 attacks were recorded, and on the most intense, this reached 1,164.”Bad guys need their holidays, tooKaspersky reckons attackers taking vacations and a fall in the value of cryptocurrencies led to the spring DDoS lull.Despite the relatively quiet months, several high-profile organizations fell victim to attacks. For instance, Microsoft cloud services including Xbox Live, Microsoft Teams, and OneDrive were affected by a DNS flood in early April.Several (mostly European) ISPs were targeted by DDoS attacks during Q2. And in May, the Irish Health Service Executive was hit by an assault.Turn up the volumeKaspersky reports that over recent months the perpetrators of DDoS attacks have looked to increase the traffic volume or amplify their attacks. This has led to an increase in the number of attacks made through the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol.Abuse of the STUN protocol, which is normally used to map internal IP addresses and ports hidden behind NAT to external addresses, can be abused to multiply the volume of junk traffic by a factor of 32 even before other techniques are brought into play.Catch up on the latest DDoS attack newsAbusing STUN servers in this way can disable their functionality, a concern for the 75,000 organizations that Kaspersky estimates are operating vulnerable setups.Looking ahead, Kaspersky warns that the recently discovered TsuNAME vulnerability in DNS resolvers ought to be addressed before it gets abused by cybercriminals.The new abnormalCybersecurity firm Netscout also reports that the volume of DDoS attacks that took place in Q2 2021 decreased from the record-breaking numbers seen in the first quarter of the year.Threat actors launched 2,488,048 DDoS attacks in Q2, a 13% decrease compared with the 2,863,882 attacks in Q1.Netscout said: “Although attack frequency has dropped, these figures are nowhere near the attack numbers that were considered normal prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

no,"Data breaches are costing more than ever, as organizations take longer to detect attacks, apply patches – report",Annual study by IBM Security shows financial fallout is at an all-time-high,"The financial cost of a data breach is at its highest ever, due in part to the coronavirus pandemic and organizations taking significantly longer to resolve incidents.IBM Security released its annual ‘Cost of a Data Breach Report’ today (July 28), which found that the average cost associated with a breach is now $4.2 million.The figure, up 10% on last year’s findings, is the highest recorded in the 17-year history of the study.Read more of the latest news about data breachesThe shift to remote working due to the Covid-19 is largely blamed for the rise in security incidents, with 60% of the 500 breach-hit organizations involved in the IBM study confirming that their employees had been working from home during the pandemic.When home working was determined to be a factor in a data breach, these security incidents had an average cost of nearly $5 million per incident – almost 15% more than the average breach regardless of cause.Added to this, the average time taken for businesses to patch previously disclosed software vulnerabilities has increased by a week since last year’s report, now taking a total of 287 days – 212 to detect and 75 to contain.‘Deeply concerning’Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Centre, said that the widening breach detection window is the stand-out finding of the survey.He commented: “Arguably, the Covid influenced remote work environment we saw for much of 2020 shouldn’t have a large impact on breach identification and containment, but that wasn’t the case.“With several high-profile software supply chain attacks in the last six months, it should be deeply concerning to learn that in 2020 it took 286 days on average to identify and contain a breach that started based on an exploited software vulnerability.“While some zero-day attacks will factor into this stat, the reality is that software patch management is automation friendly making this stat something that is resolvable.“Since it isn’t resolved, that speaks to a blind spot in patch management – one which likely is based on an assumption that vendors push update notifications to their customers.”Mackey added: “Cybercriminals know such a blind spot exists, but closing it is easy.”READ Coronavirus: How to work from home securely during a period of isolationIndeed, the adoption of AI, security analytics, and encryption were successful mitigating factors shown to reduce the cost of a breach, the report states, saving companies between $1.3 million and $1.5 million compared to those who did not have significant usage of these tools.Chris McCurdy, vice president and general manager at IBM Security, commented: “Higher data breach costs are yet another added expense for businesses in the wake of rapid technology shifts during the pandemic.“While data breach costs reached a record high over the past year, the report also showed positive signs about the impact of modern security tactics... which may pay off in reducing the cost of these incidents further down the line.”TrendsOther findings of the IBM report include that nearly half (44%) of the breaches in the study exposed personal data, such as names, email addresses, passwords, or even healthcare data – representing the most common type of compromised record in the report.An increasingly common trend, cybercriminals have also been targeting healthcare providers at an alarming rate during the coronavirus outbreak.Indeed, of the breaches surveyed, those affecting healthcare services cost the most by far, at $9.2 million per incident – a $2 million increase over the previous year.This was followed by the financial sector ($5.7 million) and pharmaceuticals ($5 million), while the retail, media, hospitality, and public sectors also experienced higher costs than previous years.ScaleThe report, from IBM Security and Ponemon Institute, is based on an analysis of real-world data breaches of 100,000 records or less, experienced by over 500 organizations worldwide between May 2020 and March 2021.Included in the study were the cost factors involved in data breach incidents from legal, regulatory, and technical activities to loss

no,Chained Zimbra flaws gave attackers unrestricted access to mail servers,Researchers help fix two security flaws that opened the door to internal data and networks,"Zimbra, an open source webmail platform used by more than 200,000 enterprises, contained a pair of vulnerabilities that, if combined, allowed unauthenticated attackers to gain control of Zimbra servers.If victims opened a malicious email, attackers could gain unrestricted access to all emails sent and received by employees, potentially compromising the full mail server when run in a cloud environment.XSS to SSRFDiscovered by Simon Scannell, a vulnerability researcher at SonarSource, the first vulnerability was a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug – CVE-2021-35208 – that could be triggered in a victim’s browser when they simply viewed an incoming email.When executed, a crafted JavaScript payload gave the attacker access to all the victim’s emails, as well as their webmail session, and allowed other Zimbra features to be accessed and further attacks to be launched.RECOMMENDEDChained vulnerabilities in Aruba Networks firmware allowed remote code execution on routersThe second vulnerability involved a bypass of an allowlist that leads to a powerful server-side request forgery (SSRF) exploit that can be launched via an authenticated account belonging to a member of the target organization with any permission role.This means that it could be combined with the first vulnerability to compromise the complete Zimbra webmail server of a victim organization.“The second vulnerability allows an attacker to send HTTP requests to arbitrary hosts or ports,” Scannell tells The Daily Swig.“Combined with protocol smuggling, this could lead to RCE. It could also enable an attacker to steal highly sensitive metadata, such as access tokens to the account that is associated with the instance that would have been exploited.”These could include Google Cloud API tokens or AWS IAM credentials from instances within the cloud infrastructure.Coordinated disclosureThe vulnerabilities, both rated as medium severity, could have had serious effects, says Scannell.“Both vulnerabilities work on default configuration and are affecting the Zimbra core,” he says. “The website of Zimbra states that their solution is used by over 200,000 businesses that could have been targeted with these vulnerabilities.”The issues were reported to the Zimbra team on May 20 and 22, with patches released on 28 June for the 8.8.15 and 9.0 series.Read more cross-site scripting (XSS) newsThe SSRF attack can be mitigated by disallowing the HTTP request handler to follow redirects, while the XSS attack has been fixed by removing the code that transformed the form tag altogether.As Scannell points out, a similar SSRF vulnerability was exploited in 2019 to breach assets of US bank Capital One – leading to an $80 million penalty for the company.“SSRF vulnerabilities have always been dangerous, but it has only become clear in recent years how dangerous they can be,” he says.“In cloud native applications, an SSRF vulnerability can be used by attackers as an entry to the cloud infrastructure’s internal network. This can lead to the disclosure of highly sensitive information such as access keys to cloud hosting accounts associated with the targeted instance.”Full technical details can be found on the SonarSource blog.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/chained-zimbra-flaws-gave-attackers-unrestricted-access-to-mail-servers,"['Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Email', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'SSRF', 'Path', 'Traversal', 'Browsers', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'API', 'JavaScript', 'Authentication', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations']"
no,Kaseya denies ransomware payment as it hails ‘100% effective’ decryption tool,‘We are confirming in no uncertain terms that Kaseya did not pay a ransom’,"Kaseya has denied rumors that it paid a ransom to the REvil cybercrime gang as it continues to roll out a decryptor to victims of a recent ransomware attack.The software supply chain attack, which began on July 2, is believed to have affected up to 1,500 organizations via the hack of IT management platform Kaseya VSA.BACKGROUND REvil ransomware attackers demand $70m following Kaseya VSA supply chain attackKaseya revealed on July 22 that it had obtained a decryption tool from a “third party” and was working to restore the environments of impacted organizations with the help of anti-malware experts Emsisoft.SpeculationThe update sparked speculation as to the identity of the unnamed third party, with Allan Liska of Recorded Future’s CSIRT team positing a disgruntled REvil affiliate, the Russian government, or that Kaseya themselves had paid the ransom.The theory that the universal decryptor key became available because of law enforcement action was strengthened on July 13 when the dark web domains associated with REvil abruptly went offline.Catch up on the latest ransomware-related news and analysisHowever, some experts also said it was likely that this was a prelude to REvil, whose other notable scalps include Travelex and meat supplier JBS, rebranding itself in a bid to dodge law enforcement.Non-disclosure agreementThe cybercrime outfit was believed to have initially demanded a payment of $70 million from Kaseya, before lowering the asking price to $50 million.Kaseya, which has reportedly granted organizations access to the decryptor contingent on signing a non-disclosure agreement, addressed rumors that it had paid a ransom in a statement yesterday (July 26):Recent reports have suggested that our continued silence on whether Kaseya paid the ransom may encourage additional ransomware attacks, but nothing could be further from our goal. While each company must make its own decision on whether to pay the ransom, Kaseya decided after consultation with experts to not negotiate with the criminals who perpetrated this attack and we have not wavered from that commitment. As such, we are confirming in no uncertain terms that Kaseya did not pay a ransom – either directly or indirectly through a third party – to obtain the decryptor.Kaseya said that “the decryption tool has proven 100% effective at decrypting files that were fully encrypted in the attack”.It added: “We continue to provide the decryptor to customers that request it, and we encourage all our customers whose data may have been encrypted during the attack to reach out to your contacts at Kaseya”.More zero-daysLast week, meanwhile, security researchers from the organization that unearthed the zero-day Kaseya vulnerabilities exploited by REvil disclosed a trio of additional zero-day flaws in another Kaseya product.The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) advised users of cloud-based Kaseya Unitrends, which is available as an add-on for Kaseya VSA, not to expose the service to the internet until a patch was released.Also last week, Huntress Labs released a blog post speculating on why the compromise of 60 upstream, managed service provider customers via a fake software update hadn’t had even more calamitous consequences.Dismissing the idea that Kaseya’s system shutdown was the primary reason, security researcher John Hammond pondered, among other potential reasons, whether threat actors had learned “from previous incidents (like Colonial Pipeline) that a much larger impact might invite government intervention?”RELATED No More Ransom celebrates success in helping 600k people recover from ransomware attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/kaseya-denies-ransomware-payment-as-it-hails-100-effective-decryption-tool,"['Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Ransomware', 'Encryption', 'Enterprise', 'Government', 'US', 'Russia', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'RCE', 'Authentication', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Fraud', 'OpSec', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Malware', 'Industry', 'News', 'Legal']"

no,Research roadblock: Security pros weigh in on China’s new vulnerability disclosure law,New regulation may present ‘new challenges to security researchers and pen testers working in China’,"Security researchers operating in the People’s Republic of China will soon be required to hand over information on vulnerabilities, including zero-days, to the authorities.Regulations from the Cyberspace Administration of China will require anyone finding security vulnerabilities to inform the government from September.This, according to a recent report by Recorded Future imprint The Record, must be done within two days, with all bugs being reported to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).RELATED China puts national security protection at the center of new data privacy lawBug hunters will be banned from giving information about their findings to any “overseas organizations or individuals”, with the exception of the affected product’s manufacturer or software developer.In addition, no one can “collect, sell or publish information on network product security vulnerabilities”, according to a report in the Associated Press.Line in the sandThe new rules – Regulations on the Management of Network Product Security Vulnerability – come into force on September 1.China experts say the rules are primarily aimed at overseas crime groups or, potentially, foreign intelligence agencies.The law states that it is not permitted to use vulnerability information for “malicious speculation or fraud, extortion and other illegal and criminal activities”.It will also be against the rules to release tools that exploit vulnerabilities. If a weakness is published, a repair or patch has to be released at the same time.ANALYSIS Behind the Great Firewall: Chinese cyber-espionage adapts to post-Covid world with stealthier attacksThe measures largely bring China’s cybersecurity regulations in line with those in the west.However, some observers worry that the rules could limit legitimate security research, penetration testing, and participation in bug bounty programmes.They argue it could also allow Chinese cyber agencies to “stockpile” vulnerabilities for future use.China’s new security vulnerability disclosure rules come into effect on September 1At the same time, though, the regulations recommend that vendors set up “reward mechanisms” for reporting vulnerabilities. But network operators and product vendors also need to register their vulnerability reporting platforms with the MIIT.“This rule has the potential to present new challenges to security researchers and penetration testers working in China.

no,"Interview: Patchstack’s Oliver Sild on securing WordPress, one plugin vulnerability at a time",Stacking the odds in site owners’ favor,"WordPress is the world’s most popular content management system, powering around 40% of all websites globally.While the open source technology has helped millions of business owners, bloggers, and hobbyists to carve out their own online niche, WordPress security remains a key issue.Over recent months, the developers of WordPress Core – the ‘foundational’ files that are required for the software to work – have doubled down on their efforts to protect site owners with the launch of several new features.RELATED WordPress 5.8 update extends Site Health interface for developersNow, as WordPress approaches its 20th anniversary, one company has joined the fray to help protect an even bigger attack surface: the WordPress plugin ecosystem.Oliver Sild is an active member of the Estonian infosec community. He’s organized capture-the-flag competitions for the past few years and was recently involved in opening a physical hacker space in his hometown.We spoke to Sild about WordPress security and how his new venture, Patchstack, has taken inspiration from the bug bounty business model to develop a new platform for securing WordPress plugins and the sites they run on.What is Patchstack, and what are you aiming to achieve with this new venture?Oliver Sild: Patchstack is building a community of cybersecurity researchers to help secure the WordPress ecosystem. WordPress is growing really quickly, and it has a very strong community of developers. At the same time, we believe it’s time for WordPress to not only have a strong community of developers, but also a strong community of [associated] security researchers as well.RECOMMENDED Multiple vulnerabilities in WordPress plugin pose website remote code execution riskWhat we’ve built is a gamification-based bug hunting platform, where researchers can find vulnerabilities in whatever WordPress plugin they choose. They report it to our Patchstack Red Team platform, and they receive a score based on the severity of the vulnerability, how many websites it affects, and so on.All of the research that’s done on this platform is eventually going to be put on the Patchstack Database, an open and free vulnerability database for WordPress plugins. We also have a Software-as-a-Service [SaaS] application, the Patchstack App, which provides virtual patches or live patches for all those vulnerabilities that our community defines.How does it work?OS: Patchstack Red Team doesn’t pay out bounties per finding. If we were to do that then only the big commercial plugins like Yoast or Elementor would have the money to pay, right? We didn’t want that to happen, so we decided to completely remove the traditional bug hunting or bug bounty ‘way’ and replace it with a gamification-based leaderboard system.After a researcher submits a vulnerability, we take the CVSS score of the vulnerability, multiply that by the number of active installations, give them a score and then at the end of the month we have a leaderboard of the top contributors to the WordPress security [community].How do you decide which researchers get paid?OS: Each month we have a prize pool, which has just started paying out. The prize pool for June was about €1,500. The researcher in first place received around $700, and payments reduce as you go down the leaderboard. In the past two months, over 430 new vulnerabilities have been reported to us.There are more than 50,000 free WordPress plugins in the official storeDo you find it surprising that there aren’t more companies focused specifically on securing WordPress?OS: There are numerous companies that provide security for WordPress sites, but a lot of them are mainly focused on the malware scanning side of things. WordPress users are not technical in most cases, and many don’t think about security before they’re hit [by an attack].Read more of the latest infosec interviewsCurrently, most of the service or security products are mainly approaching from the malware removal side of things, where someone already has a website and then they are looking for a security solution following an attack. We are driving the completely opposite way; we decided that we are not even going to build a malware scanner as there are plenty of companies who are already doing that. We decided that we would take just one very specific issue in the WordPress ecosystem, and that’s plugin vulnerabilities and plugin security.How important is plugin security when it comes to protecting WordPress sites and users?OS: Earlier this year, we released a white paper for all the WordPress vulnerabilities disclosed in 2020. We analyzed every single vulnerability that was out there for WordPress, and 96.2% of all the vulnerabilities across the WordPress ecosystem were related to plugins.If we can solve the plugin issue as a community, we would probably make WordPress way more secure than it is right now.The launch of WordPress 5.5 last year included a new feature that auto-updates website plugins. What do you make of this development?OS: Previously, it was only possible to enable auto-update for WordPress core. Although this can help improve the security of WordPress sites, when they released the new functionality that can auto-update all the plugins and themes as well, people started to write a lot of articles about how to turn this feature off.Web developers are really worried because if someone is auto-updating their software, they don’t know what kind of code is shipped to the website, so this feature really didn’t solve everything.Patchstack is hosting the 2021 WP Bug HuntHow is Patchstack approaching coordinated disclosure? Do you have any safe harbor policies to help give researchers peace of mind before they start hacking?OS: Things are a little different for us, compared to other vulnerability disclosure platforms, because all of the plugins from the WordPress repository are open source.Our platform automatically pulls in all of the plugins, and this makes it very simple for the researchers to see which ones have more installations, which ones were updated recently, and then they can just look at the source code. Once they report a plugin vulnerability to Patchstack, we manage the triage process for them: we notify the plugin developer and make sure it’s going to be fixed.We’re talking regularly with the WordPress plugin team, and Patchstack is authorized as an official CNA to directly assign CVE IDs to vulnerabilities reported to us.How can security researchers join Patchstack Red Team?OS: We are onboarding around one new researcher every week. Right now, we are hand-picking researchers from the 1,600 people who originally expressed interest in the project.We are planning to allow researchers to sign up and start hacking in the future. For now, to get an invite and to get started, we invite people to participate in WordPress Bug Hunt 2021, where they can win Burp Suite licenses, PentesterLab licenses, Hak5 kits, and invitations to the Patchstack Red Team.READ ON Offensive Security’s Ning Wang on training the next generation of infosec pros",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/interview-patchstacks-oliver-sild-on-securing-wordpress-one-plugin-vulnerability-at-a-time,"['Interviews', 'WordPress', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'VDP', 'Analysis', 'Research', 'Industry', 'News', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks']"

no,Dozens of web apps vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning via ‘forgot password’ feature,"Of 146 tested, two applications were vulnerable to Kaminsky attacks, and 62 to IP fragmentation attacks","Vulnerabilities in the way websites resolve email domains have left many sites open to DNS attacks that can lead to account hijacking, new research shows.In a study of 146 web applications, Timo Longin, security researcher at SEC Consult, found misconfigurations that malicious actors could exploit to redirect password reset emails to their own servers.DNS cache poisoningMost websites have a ‘forgotten password’ feature that sends a message to the user’s email with a link or one-time passcode enabling them to reset their password or regain access to their account. The goal of the study was to find out whether an attacker could force the application to send these emails to an arbitrary server.For this to happen, the attacker must carry out DNS cache poisoning, where the domain name of the target user (e.g., gmail.com or example.com) is resolved to the IP address of a server the attacker controls.Read more of the latest DNS security news and analysisThe study was focused on two well-known and well-documented attacks. One is known as the ‘Kaminsky attack’, named after late security researcher Dan Kaminsky, who reported it first in 2008. The Kaminsky attack takes advantage of low-entropy port assignment in web servers to intercept DNS resolution requests and send forged responses.The second technique, known as an IP fragmentation attack, was first reported in 2013. In this scheme, the attacker takes advantage of the limited buffer size of server responses to send malicious packets.“In internal security assessments, it is common practice to exploit the ‘forgot password?’ feature of internal web applications to obtain password reset URLs in emails,” Longin told The Daily Swig.“This is easy to do in a local network, as malicious-in-the-middle attacks can be done using ARP spoofing to redirect password reset emails sent by web applications to the attacker. Based on this attack vector, and with the potentially devastating consequences in mind, an attempt was made to apply this concept to web applications on the internet.”Malicious DNS responsesLongin analyzed the DNS resolution process of 146 web applications.

yes,Google supercharges Chrome’s phishing detection mechanism,Vastly improved detection speeds in Chrome 92 eases CPU processing burden,"Google says the latest version of Chrome detects phishing scams 50 times faster than its predecessor.This dramatic improvement means users of Chrome 92, which was released on Tuesday (July 20), will be warned more quickly that they’ve unwittingly navigated to a malicious domain, claims the tech giant.Users will on average “get their phishing classification results after 100 milliseconds, instead of 1.8 seconds”, explained Chrome developer Olivier Li Shing Tat-Dupuis in a blog post.“This speed improvement makes a real difference in security – especially when it comes to stopping you from entering your password in a malicious site!”Li Shing Tat-Dupuis says the streamlined detection algorithm also eases the burden on CPU time and therefore drains less battery power.Color me goodChrome’s development team achieved this through computational tweaks to how Chrome compares a web page’s color profile – comprising the range and frequency of colors presented – to those of known phishing domains.Chrome’s phishing detection feature counts the basic colors in each pixel and stores the counts in one of three associative data structures called ‘hashmaps’ (for red, green, and blue colors).Catch up on the latest browser security news and analysisThe algorithm has been updated to abandon tracking red-green-blue channels in three different hashmaps in favor of “only one to index by color” – slashing counting volumes by a factor of three.“Consecutive pixels are summed before being counted in the hashmap,” said Li Shing Tat-Dupuis. “For a site with a uniform background color, this can reduce the hashmap overhead to almost nothing.”CPUnburdenedThis streamlines image processing, which “can often generate heavy workloads” for CPUs given “some modern monitors display upwards of 14 million pixels”, said the Chrome developer.When Safe Browsing mode is enabled, images are analyzed by the user’s machine rather than outside of the browser in order to preserve privacy.The optimized phishing mechanism has cut CPU time used by Chrome renderer and utility processes by 1.2%.“Chrome now executes image-based phishing classification up to 50 times faster at the 50th percentile and 2.5 times faster at the 99th percentile,” said Li Shing Tat-Dupuis.RELATED Google to bolster Chrome privacy protections with HTTPS-First Mode",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-supercharges-chromes-phishing-detection-mechanism,"['Chrome', 'Phishing', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Browsers', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Google', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Privacy', 'Education']"
no,Multiple encryption flaws uncovered in Telegram messaging protocol,Vulnerabilities highlight risks of ‘knit-your-own’ crypto,"UPDATED An analysis of the popular Telegram secure messaging protocol has identified four cryptographic vulnerabilities.Although none of the flaws are particularly serious or easy to exploit, security researchers have nonetheless warned that the software “falls short on some essential data security guarantees”.Standard deviationComputer scientists from from ETH Zurich and Royal Holloway, University of London, uncovered the vulnerabilities after examining the open source code used to provide encryption services to the Telegram app. The audit excluded any attempt to attack any of Telegram’s live systems.The researchers found that Telegram’s proprietary system falls short of the security guarantees enjoyed by other, widely deployed cryptographic protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).ETH Zurich professor Kenny Paterson commented that encryption services “could be done better, more securely, and in a more trustworthy manner with a standard approach to cryptography”.Catch up with the latest encryption-related news and analysisThe most significant vulnerability among the quartet makes it possible for an attacker to manipulate the sequencing of messages coming from a client to one of the cloud servers operate by Telegram.A second flaw made it possible for an attacker on the network to detect which of two messages are encrypted by a client or a server, an issue more of interest to cryptographers than hostile parties, the researchers suggest.The third security issue involves a potential manipulator-in-the-middle attack targeting initial key negotiation between the client and the server. This assault could only succeed after sending billions of messages.A fourth security weakness made it possible (at least in theory) for an attacker to recover some plain text from encrypted messages – a timing-based side-channel attack that would require an attacker to send millions of messages and observe how long the responses take to be delivered. The researchers admit the attack is impractical while Telegram goes further and categorises it as a non-threat.""The researchers did not discover a way to decipher messages,"" a representative of Telegram told The Daily Swig.In a statement, the firm welcomed the researchThe traits of MTProto pointed out by the group of researchers from the University of London and ETH Zurich were not critical, as they didn't allow anyone to decipher Telegram messages. That said, we welcome any research that helps make our protocol even more secure.These particular findings helped further improve the theoretical security of the protocol: the latest versions of official Telegram apps already contain the changes that make the four observations made by the researchers no longer relevant.The researchers notified Telegram about their research in April. Telegram has since patched all four flaws, clearing the way for researchers to go public with their findings through a detailed technical blog post.TLS recommendationRoyal Holloway professor Martin Albrecht told The Daily Swig that the researchers offered lessons for other developers of secure messaging apps – for example, industry standard TLS encryption should be a preferred design choice.“The ‘mode’ of Telegram we looked at was when messages are encrypted between the client and the server only,” Albrecht explained.“This is no different from running Facebook Messenger or IRC [Internet Relay Chat] over TLS. Here it makes little sense to not use TLS (or its UDP variants). It is well studied, including its implementations, it does not need special assumptions, it is less brittle than [for example] MTProto.”MTProto is the encryption scheme used by Telegram.READ Kaspersky Password Manager lambasted for multiple cryptographic flawsTelegram already relies on TLS for its security for messages from the server to Android clients, but it relies on proprietary approaches elsewhere.Whether apps are built using TLS as a foundation or not, an audit by cryptographers is highly advisable.Albrecht commented: “When we talk about secure messaging apps specifically, i.e messages are encrypted between the parties not just the transport layer between client and server, they should have cryptographers on staff who formally reason about the design. In the future this should get easier with the MLS standard.”Hong Kong GardenThe research into Telegram was motivated by use of technology by participants in large-?scale protests such as those seen in 2019/2020 in Hong Kong.“We found that protesters critically relied on Telegram to coordinate their activities, but that Telegram had not received a security check from cryptographers,” according to Albrecht.Albrecht was part of a team that researched what makes the Telegram platform attractive to high-risk users involved in mass protests, who are likely to be targeted by surveillance.“Telegram does seem to have the advantage of ‘staying up’ in light of government crackdown in contrast to other social networks and seemingly not complying all that much with government requests,” according to Albrecht.YOU MAY LIKE Threema, the European rival to Signal, wins pivotal privacy battle in Swiss CourtAlthough mobile messaging apps such as Signal are often recommended and used by the security-savvy, features and utility are more important for mainstream users and go some way to explaining use of Telegram among protesters in Hong Kong and beyond.“It might be better to compare Telegram to Facebook or Twitter (in terms of features and appeal) than to, say, Signal,” he added.Telegram may be preferred to Facebook even if the latter is likely better or at stricter when it comes to data governance, Albrecht concluded.“On the flip side, it is not clear what security policies, processes and safeguards Telegram have in place to, e.g continuously vet their (server and client) code for software vulnerabilities, to prevent their own staff from snooping.”This story was updated to add comment from Telegram that welcomed the work of the researchers but disputed the impact of one of the admitted vulnerabilities.RELATED Encryption issues account for minority of flaws in encryption libraries – research",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/multiple-encryption-flaws-uncovered-in-telegram-messaging-protocol,"['Encryption', 'Network', 'Security', 'Mobile', 'Privacy', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Surveillance', 'Research', 'MitM', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'China', 'Asia', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Side-channel', 'Austria', 'UK', 'Government', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Europe']"
no,Respect in Security: New infosec campaign aims to stamp out harassment,Group of security professionals calls for higher standards of behavior online and in the workplace,"More than a third of infosec professionals have experienced harassment from their peers, according to a study by a new initiative aiming at tackling the problem.Respect in Security, which launches today, is a network made up of cybersecurity experts and backed by major organizations within the space.The study, which was produced by Sapio Research, polled 302 male, female, and non-binary industry professionals across multiple age groups, organization sizes, and levels of seniority.It found that 32% of respondents have experienced online harassment, 44% of which occurred on Twitter and 37% via email.A similar proportion, 35%, said they have been harassed in person – 36% of which occurred at industry events, 47% in the office, and 48% during work social events.More needs to be doneWhile 82% of respondents said their employer has an anti-harassment policy and complaints procedure, 45% said more needs to be done to “understand what constitutes harassment and what acceptable behavior looks like”.The study also found that 16% of respondents said they would not tell anyone if they witnessed or were a victim of harassment – 7% of whom said this was because they’re too scared to.Speaking to The Daily Swig, Marc Avery, director at Cyber Chain Alliance and co-founder of Respect in Security, said one of the main issues in the infosec industry is a “general lack of awareness” of issues related to harassment which, in turn, “creates an environment where victims are reluctant to speak out”.YOU MAY LIKE ‘Soft skills are the most under-researched area of the bug bounty industry’ – ‘Reconless’ YouTubers on filling a gap in infosec educationAvery said: “If we can make people more aware of how our words and actions can make others feel, then this will provide a clear message that all forms of harassment are not tolerated in this industry…“Whilst we are not offering direct support to victims, there does appear to be a lack of support, and so we have partnered with the Cyber Helpline who are, amongst other things, able to offer further support and guidance for harassment victims. Again, it is important for victims to know that this support is there should they need it.”FormationRespect in Security was formed in the wake of the Cyber House Party initiative, an online conference which launched in June 2020 covering community-focused topics such as inclusion and wellbeing.Following a panel session that covered online harassment – “one of the most eye-opening, courageous, and well-received sessions” says Avery – a team was formed to talk about how they could bring change to what was “a muted issue”. Thus, Respect in Security was born.“With the right support and commitment from individuals and organizations, we expect that the initiative will help our industry to be more resilient and prepared to deal with issues affecting our colleagues and friends,” Avery said.READ MORE Many Hats Club founder announces closure – spelling end for podcast, conference, Discord communitySo far, a number of organizations within the infosec industry have signed up, pledging to instill the values it espouses within their workforces.For instance, Lauren McKenna, global senior HR director at Trend Micro, said her employer has pledged “to support a workplace and community free from harassment and fear”.British telecoms company Arqiva said it has “a zero-tolerance approach to harassment to any person, in any form”.Read more of our latest infosec industry interviewsHayley-Rose Hill, performance, engagement, and inclusion lead at Arqiva, said: “We want all our work environments to be inclusive, where everyone can be the best that they can be, and feel safe and respected while doing so… that is why we commit to the Respect in Security pledge.”And Dave Mareels, CEO at threat analysis provider SOC.OS, said: “By proudly pledging our commitment to Respect in Security together with many of our industry peers, we hope to take that one step further towards being an organization where we honor our core values and promote wellbeing in the workplace and the wider community.”Looking aheadRespect in Security has already garnered attention online, particularly amongst the infosec Twitter community.Lisa Forte, partner at Red Goat Cyber Security LLP and co-founder of Respect in Security, told The Daily Swig: “The response has been phenomenal. We have had a huge wave of support from professionals and companies alike. Personally, I have had a large number of messages from people saying how relieved they are to see this initiative go live.”Going forward, the team aims to add more companies to its list of supporters.Marc Avery added: “This is no doubt going to be a long journey and our research will drive any further actions.“In the first instance it is going to be important to listen carefully to what people are saying.“There are other bodies within our industry who may be in a better position to adapt their own codes of conduct and professional ethics and so we are not attempting to replicate that – our current focus is to raise the awareness and provide an environment where victims feel more comfortable to speak out and where perpetrators think twice about their actions.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE ‘Being serious about security is a must’ – Apache Software Foundation custodians on fulfilling its founding mission",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/respect-in-security-new-infosec-campaign-aims-to-stamp-out-harassment,"['Industry', 'News', 'Research', 'Social', 'Media', 'Interviews', 'Organizations', 'Education', 'Compliance']"

no,Sensitive medical data of cancer patients at Jefferson Health potentially breached following third-party hack,Security incident at Elekta could have exposed the records of even more US citizens,"Another US healthcare provider has announced that patient information may have been exposed as a result of the third-party Elekta breach.Jefferson Health, which has medical centers across Philadelphia, said that patients’ names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, and clinical information related to treatment – such as physician name and department, treatment plans, and diagnosis and/or prescription information – had potentially been accessed.For some patients, a Social Security number was also included, the healthcare provider said in a statement. Financial account, insurance, and payment card information was not involved, it added.Read more of the latest healthcare security newsJefferson Health’s systems, network, and electronic health records were not accessed since the breach occurred on Elekta’s systems, which held a database for cancer patients seen at Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, one of Jefferson Health’s 14 hospitals. “The incident was not targeted at Jefferson Health or its hospitals,” the provider added.Patients affected by the incident will be informed by post and offered free credit monitoring services.Jefferson Health said it regrets that the incident occurred and is “committed to protecting the security and privacy of patient information”, adding that it is “re-evaluating its relationship with Elekta”.Third-party perilThe breach arose from unauthorized access to third-party software Smart Clinic, a cloud-based mobile app which allows clinic providers to access patient information related to cancer treatments.Smart Clinic is manufactured by Elekta, which confirmed in April this year that it had been the victim of a “data security incident”.Elekta said it has launched an investigation to “understand what happened, mitigate any possible harm, and offer our customers a reliable solution that delivers on our commitment to ensure that cancer patients have access to precise and personalized radiotherapy treatments.“We recognize the impact this might have on customers and their patients and are working tirelessly to enable customers to continue providing secure patient care,” the organization added.Multiple victimsJefferson Health is the latest of several healthcare providers to disclose a breach related to the Elekta incident.The private medical information of patients at Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC) providers, for instance, was exposed after the center used Smart Clinic to conduct legally-required cancer reporting to the State of Illinois.RELATED Data breach at third-party provider exposes medical information of US healthcare patientsAdvocate Aurora Health, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, reported that the personal data of 68,000 patients was breached in May as a result of the Elektra hack, while Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, Utah said the names and scanned image files of 29,000 patients were potentially compromised.The Daily Swig has reached out to Jefferson Health for comment and we will update this article accordingly should we hear back.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Healthcare data breach: 2.4m records potentially exposed at Forefront Dermatology",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/sensitive-medical-data-of-cancer-patients-at-jefferson-health-potentially-breached-following-third-party-hack,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Healthcare', 'US', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Organizations', 'Privacy', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'North', 'America', 'Database', 'Security', 'HIPAA', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Mobile', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,cURL developers take a second shot at fixing information disclosure flaw,"‘We borked the fix,’ developer candidly admits","Developers have taken a second stab at fixing a tricky flaw in cURL, the command-line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.The utility, which is popular with developers, was subject to an information disclosure bug involving interactions with Telnet servers in June.However, the attempted resolution of the flaw (CVE-2021-22898) failed to address an almost identical bug in the software which also presented an information disclosure, or potential data leak vulnerability in interacting with Telnet servers.20-year-old bugThis latest vulnerability (CVE-2021-22925) represents only a medium risk flaw, but its similarity to the previous bug prompted cURL developer Daniel Stenberg to declare it as the “most embarrassing security advisory for cURL for a long time”.“We meant to fix this in the previous release but borked the fix so the problem remained and now we fix the same problem *again*,” Stenberg admitted in a recent Twitter update.Catch up with the latest secure software development news and analysisBoth issues were introduced by coding changes made in March 2001, meaning the underlying flaw had laid dormant in the software for more than 20 years.As explained in a technical advisory, the latest flaw, like its predecessor, involves the seldom used -t command-line option to send variable=content pairs to Telnet servers:Due to flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly when parsing the string provided by the application.“The previous cURL security vulnerability CVE-2021-22898 is almost identical to this one but the fix was insufficient, so this security vulnerability remained,” the developers added.Software updateNeither the latest flaw nor its near-identical predecessor are reckoned to be the target of active exploitation.

no,US DHS issues second directive for securing critical fuel supplies in wake of Colonial Pipeline attack,"Follow-up to similar recent directive prescribes contingency and recovery plan, architecture design review","Following the recent hack of Colonial Pipeline, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued a new security directive requiring critical pipelines to implement tighter security controls.The directive applies to pipelines transporting hazardous liquids and natural gas that have been designated as ‘critical’ by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).It requires them to implement specific measures to protect against ransomware attacks and other known threats to IT and operational technology systems; develop and implement a cybersecurity contingency and recovery plan; and conduct a cybersecurity architecture design review.RECOMMENDED US authorities are offering $10 million for information on nation-state cyber-attacks“Through this Security Directive, DHS can better ensure the pipeline sector takes the steps necessary to safeguard their operations from rising cyber threats, and better protect our national and economic security,” said secretary of homeland security Alejandro Mayorkas.?Unlike a previous security directive issued in May – which instructed operators to report security incidents to CISA, review their security posture, and address weaknesses found – the details of this one are designated as security sensitive, and will only be distributed to those with a ‘need to know’.Security hygiene practicesMichael Fabian, principal security consultant with the Synopsys Software Integrity Group, says that standard OT/IT security controls should include asset inventories, secure configurations, network segmentation, incident response and disaster response planning, technical solutions around backup and recovery, and network and host protection technology.Colonial Pipeline was crippled by a cyber-attack in May 2021“Security hygiene practices around incident response and disaster response are key when it comes to ransomware attack potential in terms of business continuity and damage control,” he said.“If a system is impacted by an attack, with a strategy in place, organisations are better positioned to minimise the effects of finding themselves helpless to the demands of the ransomware attackers.”Read more of the latest critical infrastructure security newsHowever, Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at security firm KnowBe4, is sceptical about the effectiveness of the new directive.“Adding another requirement on top of all the other requirements and regulations over the top of what they already know they should be doing is likely not going to result in being significantly more resilient to cyber attacks,” he said.“It cannot hurt – but it is not likely to be the final nail in the coffin that defeats all malicious hackers and malware.”The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which helped draft the latest DHS directive, has also issued an alert flagging a spear phishing campaign directed by state-sponsored Chinese actors that compromised at least 13 gas pipeline operators between December 2011 and 2013.The impact of those attacks was dwarfed in May of this year by the ransomware attack against the Colonial Pipeline Company, which paid a ransom of $4.3 million in bitcoin in order to restore gas supplies.RELATED Colonial Pipeline cyber-attack: US authorities seize $2.3m in DarkSide ransomware payments",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/us-dhs-issues-second-directive-for-securing-critical-fuel-supplies-in-wake-of-colonial-pipeline-attack,"['US', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Compliance', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Legal', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Ransomware', 'North', 'America', 'China', 'Asia', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"

no,"Update now: TIBCO Data Virtualization software vulnerable to RCE via third-party flaws, claims researcher","Vulnerabilities affect versions 8.3 and below, but vendor inadvertently addressed exploit in 8.4","A security researcher says he’s achieved remote code execution (RCE) on older, still downloadable versions of TIBCO Data Virtualization (TDV) software by chaining vulnerabilities in outdated third-party components.The flaws in TDV, a popular enterprise data virtualization platform, arise from issues in BlazeDS and Java BeanShell libraries that were fixed several years ago.Pedro Ribeiro, founder and director of research at UK-based Agile Information Security, says he fashioned a Ruby exploit after finding an unauthenticated Action Message Format (AMF) API endpoint that was vulnerable to insecure Java deserialization and an outdated Java library containing a Java deserialization gadget chain.Disclosure difficultiesThe researcher says he published a technical write-up on July 16 without the vendor’s consent, having found the disclosure process, which he initiated on July 5, to be “a complete disaster”.Despite having a “fully working remote exploit” – as demonstrated in this proof-of-concept video – he claims that TIBCO declined to confirm that it would issue a security advisory urging TDV customers to update their systems to the latest version, 8.4, or that all previous versions are vulnerable.He notes that version 8.3, which is said to be affected, is still available for download to TIBCO customers.Read more of the latest security research newsTIBCO responded by saying that its “fair disclosure” policy precluded them from confirming “issues before they are fixed”, and that it does “not assign CVEs nor issue security advisories for third-party code”.TIBCO has yet to respond to The Daily Swig’s invitation to comment, but we will update this article if and when they do.Accidental fixRibeiro says the vulnerability chain affects both Linux and Windows hosts.The latest version, 4.3, was launched in May 2021 and fixed the issue – inadvertently, suggests Ribeiro – by removing the AMF endpoint that was vulnerable to CVE-2017-5641, a flaw dating back to 2017.This critical BlazeDS library bug (CVSS 9.8) centers on a failure to “restrict which types were allowed for AMF(X) object deserialization by default,” according to the CVE description.CATCH UP Italian hosting firm Aruba.it defends data breach notification delayRibeiro referred readers to research from Markus Wulftange and Moritz Bechler for further technical details.The researcher says version 8.4 of TDV still ships with Java BeanShell library 2.0b4, which is vulnerable to CVE-2016-2510, a flaw that surfaced in 2016 (CVSS 8.1).Exploit chainRibeiro said he previously exploited the BeanShell flaw in DrayTek VigorACS and Cisco ISE by abusing a “ysoserial JRMP payload to return a malicious object to the caller”.However, this technique only worked up to TDV version 8.2, since 8.3 uses JEP-290 to “filter certain known bad classes and protect against malicious remote method invocations (RMI)”.However, Ribeiro then achieved RCE on version 8.3 by leveraging a technique, pioneered by Matthias Kaiser, that bypasses JEP-290.Rocky road to disclosureRibeiro said he sent three emails to TIBCO requesting confirmation that 8.4 was not vulnerable and whether they would issue an advisory and credit him for his research.TIBCO initially confirmed it was investigating the report and that it would not “confirm issues before they are fixed, which may contribute to response time”.It subsequently said that as a CVE Numbering Authority it discloses and assigns CVEs for vulnerabilities in TIBCO code, but for flaws “in third-party code, we would work with that third party to achieve a resolution”.READ MORE CNAs and CVEs – Can allowing vendors to assign their own vulnerability IDs actually hinder security?However, Ribeiro said that TIBCO’s vulnerability disclosure policy “doesn’t say anywhere that they don't confirm security issues to whoever reported them”.He then sent a final email “telling them what I think of their disclosure policy” and saying he would release an advisory and exploit without their consent.As of today (July 20), the researcher tells The Daily Swig that he has still not received a response to his last email, which he concedes was “pretty angry”.“I think I did the right thing [in disclosing the exploit]”, he continues. “It’s time companies like TIBCO stop treating researchers like cattle, taking our reports, ignoring us and then try to sweep vulnerabilities under the rug.“I have no desire to harm TIBCO customers, quite the contrary, and I hope that by releasing this I can force TIBCO’s hand to at least admit they have a serious vulnerability in their products and instruct all clients to upgrade to the latest version (for free).”RELATED Chained vulnerabilities in Aruba Networks firmware allowed remote code execution

This runs contrary to bogus claims on the seized domain that “Kaletra shows positive results in a blockage of a Covid-19 viral replication”, for example.“Neither domain name is authorized by Walmart to use their intellectual property or offer their products for sale,” according to US authorities. “By seizing the sites, the government has prevented third parties from acquiring the names and using it to commit additional crimes, as well as prevented third parties from continuing to access the sites in their present form.”Website scams involving Covid-19 are rife. The two sketchy domains seized in the latest case represent the 12th and 13th such Covid fraud-related domain name seizures by the Maryland US Attorney’s Office and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).The problem is not just in the US, but is international.

no,Chained vulnerabilities in Aruba Networks firmware allowed remote code execution on routers,Office pen test leads to discovery of multiple bugs in enterprise networking kit,"Multiple vulnerabilities in routers from Aruba Networks allowed attackers to conduct a series of malicious activities including remote code execution (RCE), security researchers have found.Itai Greenhut and Gal Zror from Aleph Security found a total of eight vulnerabilities in Aruba Instant, the software that allows administrators to configure the settings of Aruba routers.“We have Aruba routers providing us web access in our office,” Greenhut told The Daily Swig.“Our research started because we were working from home and wanted to research our own WiFi equipment and see how secure we are.“We also challenged ourselves and our final goal in this project was to get unauthenticated RCE on our office router.”Route to takeoverAruba routers are configured through a restricted command-line interface. The router also has an associated CGI portal that allows users to send commands to the CLI through a web interface.The researchers found a command injection vulnerability in one of the CLI commands that allowed them to create directories and download files to the server. They were then able to exploit the same vulnerability through the query string of the web interface that communicates with the CLI module.Read more of the latest security research newsNext, they found a way to upload an arbitrary file to the directory hosting the CGI application. For this, they used the server’s logging mechanism and directory traversal patterns to create a malicious file in the web server’s root directory.Finally, they used a bug in the server’s Process Application Programming Interface (PAPI) to force the router to expose the contents of its configuration file. In some of the older versions of the firmware, the configuration file contains the plaintext password of the server administrator.In newer versions, the password is hashed.“In the minimal case the password stored hashed and to continue the attack the attacker has to provide credentials or crack this hash,” Greenhut said.“The worst-case scenario is that the router still has the password stored in plaintext and after extraction of the credentials, the attacker can continue the attack as usual.”Chaining the attackWith this information, an attacker could exploit the chain of vulnerabilities to gain root shell access to Aruba routers.During their research, Greenhut and Zror found other vulnerabilities, including an argument injection vulnerability in the CLI library and a cross-site scripting bug in the captive portal, the web page displayed to users when they first connect to the router.“The exploit doesn’t need physical access to the router, it can be exploited by an attacker on the same network without any physical access,” Greenhut said.RECOMMENDED RCE vulnerability in Cloudflare CDN could have allowed complete compromise of websites“If the router exposing its web panel to the internet this exploit can also attack routers from WAN.”Greenhut also pointed out that a quick query to device search engines shows thousands of exposed routers.With Aruba being a major supplier of gear for enterprise customers such as airports, hospitals, and universities, the implications of having vulnerable routers in public locations and accessible through the internet can be critical.According to an advisory from Aruba that details the vulnerabilities, the bugs were fixed earlier this year.DON’T FORGET TO READ US authorities are offering $10m for information on nation-state cyber-attacks",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/chained-vulnerabilities-in-aruba-networks-firmware-allowed-remote-code-execution-on-routers,"['Network', 'Security', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hardware', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'RCE', 'Privacy', 'IoT', 'Passwords', 'Authentication', 'Encryption', 'XSS', 'Pen', 'Testing']"

no,Schneider Electric fixes critical vulnerabilities in EVlink electric vehicle charging stations,"Security flaws could allow an attacker to receive free vehicle charges, or lock up the charging station completely","Schneider Electric has patched security vulnerabilities in its EVlink range of electric vehicle charging stations that could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.The energy management and automation giant addressed 13 flaws in total, including three critical vulnerabilities plus eight designated as ‘high’ severity and two as ‘medium’.EVlink charging points are installed at private properties, public car parks, and for on-street charging. Three EVlink product ranges are affected: City, Parking, and Smart Wallbox.Exploitation and impactAffected EVlink owners who fail to apply the firmware update “may risk potential unauthorized access to the charging station’s web server, which could lead to tampering and [compromise] of the charging station’s settings and accounts,” warns Schneider Electric in a security alert.“Such tampering could lead to things like denial of service attacks, which could result in unauthorized use of the charging station, service interruptions, failure to send charging data records to the supervision system, and the modification and disclosure of the charging station’s configuration.”The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely if stations are exposed directly to the internet – a configuration Schneider Electric cautions against.Read more of the latest hardware security news and analysisHowever, SEC Consult security researcher Stefan Viehböck, who was involved in finding two of the vulnerabilities, told The Daily Swig that “some affected chargers [are] directly accessible from the internet based on Shodan/Censys searches”.Even within a “properly segmented internal network”, he added, they could be vulnerable to phishing and other attacks “for the initial compromise and then on lateral movement etc to get access to the charging station network.“Commercial charging infrastructure typically consists of hundreds of chargers, so if an attacker manages to get network access to them, they can take over all of them.”Schneider Electric says the flaws can also “be exploited by obtaining physical access either to the charging station’s internal communication port, which requires disassembling the charging station enclosure, or, in the case of a connected station, to the network of the charging station’s supervision system”.Hard-coded hazardThe trio of critical flaws – all assigned a CVSS score of 9.4 – can all enable attackers to gain administrative privileges via the charging station web server.They include a bypass of the authentication mechanism in the EVlink admin web interface with undocumented and hard-coded HTTP cookie values (CVE-2021-22707), another hard-coded credential issue (CVE-2021-22730), and a hard-coded password flaw (CVE-2021-22729).One of the ‘high’ severity flaws, found in the verification of a cryptographic signature (CVSS 7.2) and potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE), may have been inadvertently created by remediation of a previous code injection bug in 2018, according to SEC Consult.Firmware, recommendationsThe flaws are present in firmware R7, version V3.3.0.15, and were patched in firmware R8, version V3.4.0.1, which was issued on Tuesday (July 13).Austria-based SEC Consult has recommended that Schneider Electric “perform a thorough security review” of its EVlink product line “to identify and resolve potential further security issues”.As electric vehicle chargers continue to proliferate, Viehböck expects to see further serious vulnerabilities emerge.The upshot, he says, could be the manipulation of charging records or settings to overcharge or undercharge vehicles, the theft and misuse of charging credentials, service disruption to charging networks, and the ‘bricking’ (locking up the electronics) of cars during charging.Attackers could even “find creative ways to impact the electrical grid”, warns Viehböck.Schneider Electric declined to comment further in response to queries from The Daily Swig.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/schneider-electric-fixes-critical-vulnerabilities-in-evlink-electric-vehicle-charging-stations,"['Automotive', 'Hardware', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Research', 'Authentication', 'CSRF', 'RCE', 'SSRF', 'Encryption', 'IoT', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Austria', 'Europe', 'Passwords', 'Vulnerabilities', 'XSS', 'Network', 'Security']"

no,AWS CloudFront API: Research reveals ‘leak’ of partial account IDs,"Issue is ‘a design feature, not a bug’","Amazon Web Services (AWS), has claimed that a partial data ‘leak’ in an API, discovered by a security researcher, is not a bug but is “expected behavior”.On July 9, Arkadiy Tetelman, head of application and infrastructure security at Chime, released details of the issue in a blog post, which he said could be used to obtain “partial AWS account IDs for any CloudFront website”.Amazon CloudFront is used to deliver applications, content, and APIs to customers with low latency and high transfer speeds. The e-commerce giant released a set of new APIs for the platform on July 8 to detect conflicts and to shift CNAMES as long as source distribution is in the same account.According to Tetelman, one of the APIs will return a partial AWS ID and Cloudfront distribution ID when they are associated with a domain name to allow clients to manage AWS accounts serving traffic.“In CloudFront, a domain alias can only be associated with a single distribution globally across all AWS accounts, and for companies that have a lot of assets it can be difficult to track down which account owns a given domain – this API helps solve that problem,” the researcher noted.Read more of the latest news about security vulnerabilitiesTo prevent accidental information leaks, the cloud services provider requires a valid TLS certificate for the domain receiving a query.However, Tetelman says it is possible to “bypass” these restrictions because AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) allows the import of certificates without a valid, private key.If a public certificate for a domain is acquired, as private keys contain copies of the public key, it could then be possible to circumvent AWS’ security mechanism, the researcher said.In a potential attack scenario, a random, private key is generated, the precomputed public key parameters on this private key are then updated to impersonate the target public certificate, and this is then imported.Tetelman says that ACM only checks precomputed values, and this lack of true validation could mean that by creating a “valid” TLS certificate and submitting this to a CloudFront setup, partial account ID information could be obtained.‘Expected behavior’The same issue was reported to Amazon in 2018, but the company said that his report was not a “security concern” and was “expected behavior”.“The import process checks to see that the attributes match up – if you edit them as described, they appear to match and so can be imported,“ Amazon told the researcher.“They will fail in use though as it is not a valid public/private key combination, which is not only expected but desired.”Tetelman says there has since been “back and forth” communication, but Amazon has declined to fix the issue – which may now be more of a concern with the introduction of the new API, at least in terms of OSINT and information-gathering purposes.Speaking to The Daily Swig, the researcher said that the real-world impact is realistically low, although it may hamper Amazon’s existing protections against subdomain takeover attacks.READ Get the message: Orgs without vulnerability disclosure policies failing to address researchers’ warnings“Still, I wish Amazon would fix it just because this vulnerability so strongly breaks my expectations,” Tetelman commented.“It was clearly also a surprise to Amazon CloudFront engineers who assumed that having a TLS certificate imported into ACM meant that you own the private key for that certificate and built two use cases that depended on that behavior.“I worry that if it’s not fixed even more vulnerabilities will be introduced on top of this false assumption.”An AWS spokesperson told The Daily Swig that account IDs are not secrets, whether visible in full or only partially.The spokesperson said that if an AWS customer creates a public Amazon machine image, the account ID is published to the world by design.Account IDs are random numbers, and knowing an account ID does not hold any value, they said, adding that the number alone is not enough to gain access to account information or to be otherwise actionable.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in Apache Tomcat ‘has been present since 2015’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/aws-cloudfront-api-research-reveals-leak-of-partial-account-ids,"['Data', 'Leak', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DevSecOps', 'Amazon', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Research', 'Industry', 'News', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Privacy', 'TLS', 'Zero-day', 'Organizations', 'API', 'Hacking', 'News']"
yes,Google to bolster Chrome privacy protections with HTTPS-First Mode,New browser feature will enforce connections over the encrypted web protocol,"UPDATED Chrome 94 will ship with a new feature, HTTPS-First Mode, that attempts to upgrade all web page connections to HTTPS, Google has announced.If the site in question does not support the encrypted protocol, the browser will display a full-page warning to users, informing them that their connection will be insecure before loading the page.Catch up on the latest browser security news and analysisUsers will have to activate HTTPS-First Mode themselves if they want the function enabled, but Google said it is considering switching the service on by default in future releases, depending on user feedback.Mozilla introduced a similar function – HTTPS-Only Mode – for Firefox in November 2020.Phasing out HTTPHTTPS applies TLS encryption over the HTTP protocol in order to protect data shared via the connection from interception by eavesdroppers.Although 95% of traffic across Google is now encrypted by HTTPS – up from 50% at the start of 2014 – Google said in a blog post that “there’s more we can do to help make HTTPS the preferred protocol on the web, and better protect users on the remaining slice of the web that doesn’t yet support HTTPS”.HTTPS-encrypted connections now account for 95% of Google traffic, up from 50% in 2014 (Image: Google)Chrome’s address bar already uses https:// by default for most typed navigations that don’t specify a protocol. This change has been in place since Chrome 90.Google said it would continue to evaluate whether “powerful features” should be restricted or limited to secure origins such as HTTPS.The introduction of HTTPS-First Mode was welcomed by Alexis Hancock, director of engineering on the Certbot team at The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The EFF, a pro-privacy nonprofit, co-developed the HTTPS Everywhere browser extension, which performs a similar function to the new Chrome feature, with the Tor Project.“We are very excited to see HTTPS-First mode in Chrome,” Hancock told The Daily Swig. “Considering their lion’s share of browser adoption, this will give many users a default to utilize without any extra effort.“HTTPS Everywhere stood in that gap for 10 years and we are more than glad to see this feature come to fruition in all major browsers.”Padlock icon under threatGoogle is also running an experiment in Chrome 93 whereby the padlock icon displayed in the address bar to indicate a HTTPS connection will be replaced “with a more neutral entry point to Page Info”.Organizations will be able to opt out of the experiment, and a ‘Not Secure’ indicator will continue to be displayed on sites that don’t support HTTPS.RELATED Google abandons plans to simplify URLs in Chrome following real-world testingExplaining the move, the tech giant points to a recent Google survey in which just 11% of respondents correctly identified what the lock icon represents.“Our research indicates that users often associate this icon with a site being trustworthy, when in fact it's only the connection that's secure,” said the Chrome development team.“We hope that this experiment will improve the discoverability of critical privacy and security information and controls provided in Page Info, such as site permissions.”Guiding principlesDocumented in a Chromium wiki, Google says its plans in this area will be guided by three security-focused principles.These include better informing users of trust-related changes around insecure web connections, limiting sites’ ability to opt out of security policies related to insecure connections, and restricting how, and for how long, Chrome stores site content conveyed over insecure connections.Google said more details will be announced later this year.This article was updated with comment from the Electronic Frontier Foundation on July 15.DON’T FORGET TO READ Firefox becomes latest browser to support Fetch Metadata request headers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-to-bolster-chrome-privacy-protections-with-https-first-mode,"['Chrome', 'Browsers', 'Encryption', 'Google', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Privacy', 'TLS', 'Mozilla', 'firefox', 'Hacking', 'News', 'MitM', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Authentication']"

This is not unlike companies that start to get a bad reputation, they tend to rebrand themselves and come back as something ‘different’, even if it’s just their name.”Some evidence suggests that REvil sprang from the ashes of GandCrab, an earlier and now defunct ransomware operation.Milam and his colleagues are well placed to attribute further attacks to those behind REvil, should the gang return.“Our team would focus mainly on the hard evidence of any new variants,” Miam explained. “That would include things like fingerprinting the file/code, the modes of operation, location of attacks, etc. Most attackers won’t really change their core techniques.”Additional reporting by Jessica HaworthYOU MIGHT LIKE Research exposes vulnerabilities in IP camera firmware used by multiple vendors",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/revil-infrastructure-disappearance-sparks-speculation-about-fate-of-infamous-ransomware-slingers,"['Cybercrime', 'Ransomware', 'Malware', 'Russia', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Fraud', 'Analysis', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Phishing', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'US', 'North', 'America']"
no,DevSecAI: GitHub Copilot prone to writing security flaws,"AI pair programmer should be supervised like a toddler, says researcher","“How risky is it to allow an AI to write some, or all of your code?”Far too risky without rigorous oversight, concludes security researcher ‘0xabad1dea’ after documenting a trio of security vulnerabilities generated by AI pair programmer GitHub Copilot during a risk assessment.GitHub Copilot is designed to accelerate software development by suggesting entire lines and functions, adapting to developers’ coding style as it does so.Trained on billions of lines of code publicly available on GitHub, the machine learning tool is currently in a trial phase and available for testing as a Visual Studio Code extension.‘Reasonable at first glance’0xabad1dea says Copilot sometimes generates code that is “so obviously, trivially wrong that no professional programmer could think otherwise”.More alarmingly still, it also suggests “bad code that looks reasonable at first glance, something that might slip by a programmer in a hurry, or seem correct to a less experienced coder”.GitHub admits that “the code it suggests may not always work, or even make sense”, but adds that “it’s getting smarter all the time”.RECOMMENDED Encryption issues account for minority of flaws in encryption libraries – researchCentral to these improvements will be ongoing optimization of a sliding ‘temperature’ scale between conservatism (mimicking the most common inputs) and originality, which makes output “less structured” and more prone to “gibberish”, says 0xabad1dea.This ‘generative model’ reduces duplication between users but “is at odds with one of the most basic principles of reliability: determinism”, says 0xabad1dea.She demonstrates this with differing implementations of a moon phase calculator generated from identical inputs.The researcher also notes that Copilot is currently “unreliable” at generating comments and offers variables with “useless names”, potentially making outputs “utterly inscrutable”.Security flawsWhen she fed Copilot with general purpose HTML parser with regex – an ill-advised input, she says – Copilot “declined to use regex and wrote a complete C function and a decent main() to drive it”.Alarmingly, however, “if the parsed string contains no >, the parser will run off the end of the buffer and crash”, among other parsing issues.There was at least qualified praise for the presence of “a surprising amount of delicate pointer math”, and for Copilot being “80% of the way to something that could conceivably be considered a basic parser”.The AI tool also “blundered right into the most classic security flaw of the early 2000s: a PHP script taking a raw GET variable and interpolating it into a string to be used as an SQL query, causing SQL injection”, says 0xabad1dea. “Now PHP’s notorious propensity for security issues is infecting even non-human life.Read more of the latest machine learning security news and analysis“Furthermore, when prompted with shell_exec(), Copilot was happy to pass raw GET variables to the command line.”Prompted “for a basic listening socket”, Copilot also created “a basic off-by-one buffer error” in the listening function.The researcher was unable to verify whether Copilot excludes secret information such as API keys and passwords from its training model.“The most realistic risk here is a naive programmer accepting an autocomplete for a cryptographic key which sets it to be a random-looking but dangerously low-entropy value,” she said.‘Neural network see, neural network do’“The inevitable conclusion is that Copilot can and will write security vulnerabilities on a regular basis, especially in memory-unsafe languages,” says the researcher.While Copilot excels at generating boilerplate that may “bog down” programmers and accurately guesses constants and setup functions, it’s less adroit at handling application logic, she says.“Copilot cannot always maintain sufficient context to write correct code across many lines”, 0xabad1dea explains, while there’s no apparent “systematic separation of professionally produced code” from the profusion of “buggy code on GitHub”.She added: “Neural network see, neural network do”.Supervising a toddler0xabad1dea tells The Daily Swig that she expects GitHub to be diligent in addressing Copilot’s shortcomings, but that developers should “be realistic about the limitations”.She likens the Copilot model to a toddler. “They will impress you with how much they have learned, but they will still always lack context and experience. And of course, they shouldn’t be left unsupervised.”0xabad1dea also notes that a below-the-line commenter flagged a “tiny flaw” in an Easter date calculator she generated through Copilot.“So even when I was on the lookout, I missed something. Of course this can happen with human-written code as well, but the fact that we have so much trouble just means we don’t need our tools introducing new random faults.”The Daily Swig invited GitHub to comment on the findings but we have yet to hear back.

no,Critical vulnerabilities in open source text editor Etherpad could lead to remote takeover,"XSS bug in open source program has now been patched, though second flaw remains","Security vulnerabilities in online text editor Etherpad could allow attackers to remotely compromise a victim’s server and steal sensitive information, new research reveals.A cross-site scripting flaw (XSS) enabled attackers to create a malicious shared document, or ‘pad’, that executes attacker-controlled code in the victim’s browser, allowing assailants to read, create, or modify data.A second vulnerability, an argument injection bug, allowed attackers with administrative access to execute arbitrary code on the server by installing plugins from a URL that’s under their control.Read more of the latest news about security vulnerabilitiesBoth vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34817 and CVE-2021-34816), which were classed as ‘critical’, could be combined by attackers to compromise a server remotely.The XSS vulnerability has been fixed in Etherpad version 1.8.14. The argument injection vulnerability is still apparently unpatched, but the researchers who discovered the flaw said it is “significantly harder” to exploit on its own.Double trouble?The security issues were discovered by Paul Gerste, vulnerability researcher at SonarSource, a Switzerland-based developer of DevSecOps tools.A blog post released last night (July 13) states that Etherpad has more 250 plugins available and features a version history as well as a chat functionality.It is particularly popular within the open source community and has been bookmarked more than 10,000 times by users.Gerste told The Daily Swig that while the vulnerabilities are serious when chained, there are limitations to their exploitation.DON’T MISS WAF bypass: ‘Severe’ OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set bug was present for several years“Instances with default configuration are vulnerable,” Gerste said. “The attacker needs to be able to import a pad, so if the Etherpad instance is publicly accessible and pad creation is not restricted, then it is vulnerable.”He added: “Attackers that already have access to a pad could elevate their privileges by targeting other users.”Regarding the argument injection vulnerability, this can only be exploited if an admin account exists, which is not the case in a default configuration.Therefore, an attacker can abuse the vulnerability if they compromise an administrator’s account – which can be achieved either via exploitation of the XSS vulnerability “or by other means”.One patched, one to goGerste said that the maintainers of the project were quick to respond to his report and “took the matter seriously”, although they have only fixed one of the issues so far.“The fix for the XSS vulnerability was patched two days later,” he explained.“The argument injection was not easily fixable because of the way Etherpad’s plugin system works.“Since people can publish plugins via NPM, attackers could always find a way to introduce malicious code, so admins should always be careful which plugins they install.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Firefox becomes latest browser to support Fetch Metadata request headers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/critical-vulnerabilities-in-open-source-text-editor-etherpad-could-lead-to-remote-takeover,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'XSS', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'GitHub', 'Industry', 'News', 'Research', 'Switzerland', 'Europe', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'JavaScript', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Zero-day', 'Privacy']"
no,Encryption issues account for minority of flaws in encryption libraries – research,‘Complexity is an even worse enemy of security in cryptographic software’,"An analysis of cryptographic libraries and the vulnerabilities affecting them has concluded that memory handling issues give rise to more vulnerabilities than encryption implementation errors.The study by academics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) involved an examination of eight widely used cryptographic libraries using a combination of sources, including data from the National Vulnerability Database, individual project repositories, and mailing lists, among other sources.Vulnerabilities in any of these widely used crypto libraries puts portions of web traffic and e-commerce transactions in danger, but the study concluded that coding rigour in the development of encryption technologies compares poorly with comparably complex mainstream software.For example, a flaw in the widely used OpenSSL library in 2014 gave rise to the infamous Heartbleed vulnerability.Roll the diceThe study, entitled ‘You Really Shouldn’t Roll Your Own Crypto: An Empirical Study of Vulnerabilities in Cryptographic Libraries’, by researchers Jenny Blessing, Michael Specter, and Daniel Weitzner, found “evidence of a strong correlation between the complexity of these libraries and their (in)security, empirically demonstrating the potential risks of bloated cryptographic codebases.”Only 27.2% of vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries are cryptographic issues compared to 37.2% of vulnerabilities that are rooted in memory safety issues.Catch up with the latest encryption-related news and analysisNon-cryptographic source code generally has a lower density of CVEs introduced compared to cryptographic libraries, the researchers found.“Our findings suggest that cryptographic source code is indeed more brittle and prone to producing security bugs than a comparable amount of source code in a web browser or operating system,” the researchers conclude.“The empirical data leads us to conclude that complexity is an even worse enemy of security in cryptographic software than in non-cryptographic software.”Speaking the same languageThe researchers call for a systems-based approach to cryptographic software, as well as emphasizing the dangers of “rolling your own crypto” – meaning that software developers should rely on established libraries and tools instead of developing their own.The paper provoked a debate on the merits of different coding languages for cryptographic libraires on Twitter, in which a move away from C and C++ towards memory safe programming languages such Rust was advocated.Open source isn’t really the answer because even in open source code, such as OpenSSL, errors like Heartbleed can go undetected for years. Professor Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, told The Daily Swig: “Languages such as C/C++ are complex to write in and even though modern compilers and tool sets provide some safeguards against memory issues, they continue.“As an empirical study it’s quite useful as a means of showing anyone that wishes to roll their own that they should get a real expert in both cryptography and the languages they are using to check to ensure they haven’t made a choice or used a construction that will render the cryptography insecure.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Microsoft paid out $14m in bug bounty rewards in the last 12 months - report",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/encryption-issues-account-for-minority-of-flaws-in-encryption-libraries-research,"['Encryption', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'OSINT', 'E-Commerce', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Industry', 'News', 'Research', 'java', 'JavaScript', 'Python', 'PHP', 'Node.js', 'Authentication', 'IoT']"

no,China puts national security protection at the center of new data privacy law,Broad and vague definition of sensitive information worries lawyers,"In just a few weeks’ time, a new data security law will come into force in the People’s Republic of China.The Data Security Law (DSL) was enacted in June this year, and comes into force on September 1. The new law sets out protect data focussed on China’s national security.The legislation will sit alongside the country’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) which was updated this Spring, and the country’s existing Cyber Security Law, passed in 2017.This apparent proliferation of data protection legislation is part of a multi-year approach by the Chinese government to strengthen both data protection and national security.The new Data Security Law will apply even to businesses outside China that either work with Chinese businesses or handle the data of Chinese citizens, so its influence will extend far beyond China’s borders.Three pillarsThe 2017 Cyber Security Law (CSL) forms “the backbone of data protection from a perspective of cybersecurity”, according to Clarice Yue, Michelle Chan, and Sharon Zhang, of international law firm Bird & Bird.As the lawyers explain in a blog post, however, the CSL is general legislation without a framework for data security governance. That framework will be provided by the new Data Security Law.Together, the CSL, Data Security Law, and the PIPL form “three pillars of the Chinese data protection legislation system” according to Bird & Bird. The laws will provide a framework for both cybersecurity and data protection governance.Lawyers with expertise in the region expect the Chinese government to issue regulations for implementing the Data Security Law. But they caution these rules might not be published before September 1.Catch up with the latest privacy and legislation news and analysisThe new legislation is already causing concern among privacy and information security experts.According to the Chinese authorities, the law aims to protect national security interests. To do so, it sets out to define special classes of data, including “national core data” and “important data”.The idea of national core data was only added in the final draft of the legislation, and sets out to define data that relates to national security, the economy, and critical public interests.As yet it is not clear how narrowly – or widely – this will be defined.“Like many governments, China’s Data Security Law outlines special classes of data that are ‘core’ to national security,” Matt Stamper, CISO and executive advisor at EVOTEK, and president of ISACA San Diego Chapter, told The Daily Swig.“National core data represents those classes of data that impact the country’s national economy, security, and sovereignty. The key is how broadly defined this subset of data will be interpreted. An overly expansive view of national core data could curtail data flows and impact foreign entities working within certain sectors of the Chinese economy.”RELATED Behind the Great Firewall: Chinese cyber-espionage adapts to post-Covid world with stealthier attacksFines will depend on whether a breach of law affects either core data or important data, with higher penalties imposed for core data.Breaking the law for core data could attract a penalty of up to RMB 10 million ($1.54 million), on top of any other applicable penalties.But legal experts warn that it could be virtually impossible for firms to decide accurately whether information originating in China is core data or important data, as the proposed law defines the terms only in broad (and somewhat vague) terms.JurisdictionThe new legislation also does not only cover operations inside the People’s Republic of China.The DSL sets out to cover “data activities” by organizations, or individuals, outside China, “that harm China’s national security or public interest, or the legal interests of citizens and organizations in China”, according to an analysis by the US-based National Law Review.This raises the prospect of enforcement against both non-Chinese companies and citizens if they are deemed to breach the new Chinese law.At the same time, the legislation proposes new rules for organizations responding to requests from foreign law enforcement agencies or courts. These requests will need to be approved by a government department, unless they are covered by an existing treaty.Upcoming revisions to China's data security laws will affect Western countries doing business in ChinaAs yet, it is not yet clear how China will handle such requests, though organizations operating in China will be obliged to hand over data on request for any “national security or criminal investigation”.“Based on an incredibly broad definition of what constitutes ‘core’ and ‘important’ data, the state can basically ‘investigate’ private companies in China and inspect their data at will,” Attila Tomaschek, digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy, told The Daily Swig.New obligationsThe new law gives companies new security obligations, including establishing data security systems, risk supervision, technical measures including protection against data breaches, and setting up security education and training program.This will require companies to improve their security systems, although many of the measures Chinese law mandates are similar to other security and privacy legislation, such as the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).“What makes this whole situation even more troublesome is that companies only have until September 1 to get their act together and ensure they’re in compliance with the law,” warns ProPrivacy’s Tomaschek.“It’s not just the short timeframe, either, that is going to be an issue for companies; it’s the rather confusing and contradictory nature of the law itself that will cause major issues with compliance down the road after the law takes effect.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE British Airways agrees to pay victims of record-breaking data breach",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/china-puts-national-security-protection-at-the-center-of-new-data-privacy-law,"['China', 'Asia', 'Analysis', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Privacy', 'Industry', 'News']"

DOM XSS attacks can’t be stopped with server-side security tools, and catching them in browser code is especially tricky.“DOM XSS are difficult to find because of the large number of sources and sinks that can lead to these issues,” security researcher Micha? Bentkowski told The Daily Swig. “For instance, you need to check for innerHTML, outerHTML, location, location.href, eval-like functions etc. It is easy to miss at least one vector of DOM XSS.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-checks-rise-of-dom-xss-with-trusted-types,"['XSS', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Google', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Research', 'JavaScript', 'Browsers', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'API', 'Organizations', 'GitHub']"
no,Fake crypto-mining Android apps net fraudsters $350k,Apps – many still available on third-party stores – ‘collect money for services that don’t exist’,"Security researchers have found more than 170 fraudulent Android apps purporting to offer cloud crypto-mining services that have collectively swindled victims out of $350,000.The app developers have duped more than 93,000 users into paying around $300,000 in app purchases, and another $50,000 for fake upgrades and subscriptions, according to a blog post published by Lookout Threat Lab.Researchers found 25 of the fake cryptocurrency mining apps on Google Play, from where Google has now removed them – but dozens more are still circulating on third-party app stores.Chimerical coinsCryptocurrency mining harnesses computers’ processing power in order to verify cryptocurrency transactions by solving complex mathematical problems.The lure for unsuspecting victims in this case was the false promise of renting cloud computing power via the apps and taking a small cut of each transaction verified.The apps’ only malicious function is to “collect money for services that don’t exist”, said Ioannis Gasparis, security intelligence engineer at Lookout Threat Lab.“Their entire raison d’être is to steal money from users through legitimate payment processes, but never deliver the promised service,” he added.Catch up on the latest cryptocurrency security newsWhen users log into the apps they are presented with a fictitious, slowly incrementing coin balance, which in some cases increments “only while the app is running in the foreground and is often reset to zero when the mobile device is rebooted or the app restarted”, said Gasparis.Also displayed on the dashboard is a hash mining rate that is typically very low in order to lure the user into buying upgrades that promise faster mining rates, daily rewards, and incentives for referring friends.Users pay between $12.99 and $259.99 for this ‘virtual hardware’ via Google Play’s in-app billing system or by transferring cryptocurrency to the developers’ wallet.Insufficient fundsSome apps – dubbed ‘CloudScam’ apps by the researchers – meet withdrawal attempts with an ‘insufficient balance’ error message, while ‘BitScam’ apps bar users from withdrawing coins until they reach a minimum balance.Withdrawal attempts beyond a minimum threshold trigger a message that falsely signals a pending withdrawal and a resetting of the coin balance to zero.Cryptocurrency is likely to remain a popular bait for cyber-scammers, even despite the recent Bitcoin crash and Chinese crackdown on crypto-mining having dampened hitherto rampant enthusiasm for crypto assets.Gasparis offered advice on performing due diligence before downloading apps offering cryptocurrency-related services.“Take your time, and if a deal is too good to be true, it probably isn’t real,” he said.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/fake-crypto-mining-android-apps-net-fraudsters-350k,"['Mobile', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Fraud', 'Google', 'Cybercrime', 'Malware', 'Research', 'Blockchain', 'Industry', 'News', 'Android']"
no,"Dell Wyse Management Suite subject to database exposure, session hijacking",Vulnerabilities were identified that could 'compromise administrative sessions',"Dell has patched vulnerabilities in the Wyse Management Suite (WMS) that could open up databases to abuse and put administrative sessions at risk.On July 6, NCC Group security researcher Stephen Tomkinson released a technical advisory exploring CVE-2021-21586 (CVSS 8.1) and CVE-2021-21587 (CVSS 5.3), two vulnerabilities in WMS privately reported to Dell in early May.Hub and spokeWMS is management software provided by Dell to act as a central hub for endpoints including Dell Hybrid Client, Wyse thin, and Zero client hardware. The technology can be used to monitor up to 10,000 endpoints as well as manage users and configuration.However, according to Tomkinson, WMS also requires a level of exposure to edge network connections, even when it is used in otherwise secure environments.On versions of the software prior to 3.3, the pair of vulnerabilities, described as an absolute path traversal and a full path disclosure issue, collectively permit attackers to “retrieve arbitrary files from the server, including database credentials and database files containing the session data of administrative users”.Catch up with the latest security research news and analysisNCC Group found that an endpoint /ccm-web/image/os accepted parameters which would allow files to be retrieved from anywhere on an exposed system.A second vulnerable endpoint, also discovered by the research team, allowed further exploitation as it exposed the pathway and location of where the product was installed through an error message.According to the team, CVE-2021-21587 can be exploited if a local attacker has physical access to a thin client and its network connection.It may also be possible for remote attackers to trigger CVE-2021-21586 by authenticating to a vulnerable endpoint at the start of an attack chain through the launch of a manipulator-in-the-middle attack (MiTM).Once a request is made to the installation path of the software, an attacker can retrieve session tokens contained in a MySQL database table. Cookie values extracted from this table allowed session hijacking to take place, and it was also possible to obtain hashed WMS administrative user password credentials.Keys to the kingdomThe vulnerabilities could allow attackers to obtain access to an entire estate and its management interface – allowing them to perform actions including resetting BIOS passwords, remotely observing terminals via virtual network computing (VNC) software, and compromising administrator sessions, among other exploits.After NCC Group notified Dell, the vendor requested more information before confirming the vulnerability on May 20. A patch was issued on June 18.Dell has since issued a security advisory, published on July 6.“Dell has remediated multiple vulnerabilities in Wyse Management Suite (WMS) and assigned CVEs CVE-2021-21586 and CVE-2021-21587,” the vendor told The Daily Swig. “Customers can review the Dell Security Advisory for the affected products, versions, and additional information.

no,Kaspersky Password Manager lambasted for multiple cryptographic flaws,"‘All the passwords it created could be bruteforced,’ bemoan French researchers","The password generator feature in Kaspersky Password Manager was insecure in various ways because the security vendor failed to follow well understood cryptographic best practices, it has emerged.The multiple flaws – tracked as CVE-2020-27020 – were discovered in June 2019 but were only patched in October 2020.Users were told to update to Kaspersky Password Manager 9.0.2 Patch M and re-generate passwords. That in itself didn’t completely fix the issue because the mobile version of the software was still vulnerable until that too was addressed and an advisory published in April 2021.Dictionary attackAfter allowing several weeks for users to update their software, security researcher Jean-Baptiste Bédrune of French security outfit Ledger Donjon has gone public with a detailed technical write-up of the security flaws he discovered in the software.Up until it was updated, the Pseudo Random Number Generation bundled with Kaspersky Password Manager used the current time as its single source of entropy.As a result, every user who attempted to generate a password at the same time (in seconds) was offered the same suggested password. It also meant that any password generated using the technology was left vulnerable to a brute force attack based on a dictionary of possible passwords.“All the passwords it created could be bruteforced in seconds,” according to Bédrune.Dispute over danger posedIn response to queries from The Daily Swig, Kaspersky admitted the problem but played down the severity of the flaw, arguing that successful attacks that relied on these vulnerabilities would be difficult in practice.Kaspersky has fixed a security issue in Kaspersky Password Manager, which potentially allowed an attacker to find out passwords generated by the tool. This issue was only possible in the unlikely event that the attacker knew the user’s account information and the exact time a password had been generated. It would also require the target to lower their password complexity settings.The company has issued a fix to the product and has incorporated a mechanism that notifies users if a specific password generated by the tool could be vulnerable and needs changing.We recommend that our users install the latest updates. To make the process of receiving updates easier, our home products support automatic updates.Ledger Donjon's Bédrune disputed this assessment.""What Kaspersky means is that if an attacker tries to guess the password of a victim using Kaspersky Password Manager on his first try, he will have to know the time at which the password has been created,"" Bédrune explained. ""This is true, but this is not how attacks work"".Catch up on the latest encryption-related newsBédrune told The Daily Swig: ""Some services do not have anti-bruteforce countermeasures: you can try every password that KPM can generate, and attacks will work. This is the same with encrypted containers (TrueCrypt, Veracrypt and so on), protected archives, etc. where trying many passwords is not a problem. Another attack scenario is the one where an attacker manages to dump the database of a service containing hashed / encrypted passwords.""While credentials generated by password managers usually cannot be broken, passwords created with KPM will be breakable in seconds,"" Bédrune concluded.Independent security experts are highly critical of the design decisions made by Kaspersky that led to the flaws.Pseudo RandomCryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generation is a well-known technology with well-established standard libraries and best practices. Kaspersky disregarded these in the development of its product, apparently to the detriment of its security.Noted cryptographer Matthew Green commented: “I have to admire the combination of needless complexity combined with absolutely breath-taking incompetence.”As well as time being used as a single source of entropy, Kaspersky used a non-cryptographically secure PRNG (Mersenne Twister) as the engine for password generation in its software.Ledger Donjon show that Kaspersky’s approach compares unfavourably to the approach taken by KeePass, an open source project.CrackersKaspersky Password Manager is designed to securely stores passwords and documents into an encrypted vault, protected by a password. The technology used an overly complex method to generate its passwords, an approach also faulted by researchers.“This method aimed to create passwords hard to break for standard password crackers,” according to Ledger Donjon. “However, such method lowers the strength of the generated passwords against dedicated tools.”Ledger Donjon developed a proof of concept that details the full generation method used by KPM. In developing this PoC the researchers discovered a software bug that, somewhat ironically, makes the generation of passwords by the technology more secure than would otherwise be the case.“Writing this PoC allowed us to spot an out of bounds read during the computation of the frequency of appearance of password chars, which makes passwords a bit stronger that they should have been,” Ledger Donjon concludes.DON’T FORGET TO READ Filesec.io project catalogs malicious file extensions being used by attackers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/kaspersky-password-manager-nbsp-lambasted-for-multiple-cryptographic-flaws,"['Encryption', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Passwords', 'Research', 'France', 'Europe', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Authentication', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,British Airways agrees to pay victims of record-breaking data breach,Case described as ‘largest group action personal data claim in UK history’,"British Airways (BA) has reached an out-of-court settlement with the victims of a data breach that exposed personal data belonging to more than 420,000 customers.Under the agreement with PGMBM, the court-appointed law firm representing victims, the airline will pay thousands of claimants an undisclosed sum. The resolution does not include any admission of liability on the part of the operator.“This represents an extremely positive and timely solution for those affected by the data incident,” said PGMBM chairman Harris Pogust in a statement.“The pace at which we have been able to resolve this process with British Airways has been particularly encouraging and demonstrates how seriously the legal system is taking mass data incidents.”In response to a request for comment from The Daily Swig, British Airways said: “We apologised to customers who may have been affected by this issue and are pleased we've been able to settle the group action. When the issue arose we acted promptly to protect and inform our customers.”Magecart attackThe case centers on a Magecart-style hack of BA’s payment processing infrastructure that in 2018 diverted unsuspecting victims to a malicious website where names, debit and credit card details, postal addresses, and email addresses were harvested over a 15-day period.Login credentials of BA employee and ‘Executive Club accounts were also potentially accessed.BACKGROUND British Airways mega-breach underlines third-party script perilsIn January, PGMBM said more than 16,000 victims had submitted compensation claims with four months left until the claims window closed, making it “the largest group action personal data claim in UK history”.It estimated that “victim compensation could be up to £2,000 [$2,770] putting BA’s overall potential liability at around £800 million [$1.1 billion]”.What would have been a record-breaking fine of £183 million [$253 million] for infringements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was last year reduced to £20 million [$27.7 million] after the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) took into account the economic impact of Covid-19 on BA.However, the sum is still the largest dished out by the ICO and the fourth biggest penalty levied by any European regulator since GDPR came into force in 2018.‘Not good enough’On a website set up to help victims claim compensation, PGMBM quoted several aggrieved victims saying that the incident had damaged their credit scores.“The response from BA was not good enough,” said the firm. “BA offered a reimbursement for customers who suffered ‘direct financial losses’ and ‘credit rating monitoring’ for those affected, but did not consider the future repercussions that customers could suffer.”Read more of the latest data breach newsIt also criticized BA for failing to undertake inexpensive, technically simple security measures such as “rigorous testing”, protecting accounts with multi-factor authentication, or “limiting access to applications, data and tools to only those required to fulfill a user’s role”.However, the firm acknowledged that BA has since “made considerable improvements to its IT security”.Next up, easyJetPGMBM is now inviting victims of an even bigger breach of another UK airline to submit compensation claims.The firm has criticized operator easyJet for taking four months to notify the nine million victims of a data breach, first revealed in May 2020, involving full names, email addresses, and travel information.RELATED Data breach at third-party provider exposes medical information of US healthcare patients",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/british-airways-agrees-to-pay-victims-of-record-breaking-data-breach,"['Data', 'Breach', 'UK', 'GDPR', 'Legal', 'Magecart', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'JavaScript', 'Authentication', 'Coronavirus', 'Passwords', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Privacy', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Europe', 'Email', 'Security', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Secure', 'Development']"

The vendor also promised to make enhancements to WAF capabilities and SaaS server monitoring.CISA and the FBI have also issued additional mitigation advice aimed at MSPs and their customers.‘Maximum effort’Speaking on ABC TV show Good Morning America, Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola said: “We’re actually 100% confident that we know how it happened and we’ve remediated it.”DIVD said Kaseya has been willing to put in the “maximum effort and initiative” to get the issue fixed and customers patched. “They showed a genuine commitment to do the right thing.”Kaseya VSA is used by managed service providers to manage, monitor, and secure endpoints and corporate networks on behalf of their clients. Miami-based Kaseya says its IT management products are used by more than 40,000 customers.Supply chain attacks, which can compromise hundreds or thousands of downstream organizations by infiltrating a single software platform, have arguably become the gravest current cybersecurity threat, with the Kaseya attack coming in the wake of the destructive SolarWinds attack earlier this year.John Hammond also recalled how Huntress released an advice video in 2019 in response to a previous supply chain attack that compromised more than 100 MSPs.This article was updated on July 6 to reflect a fresh update posted by Kaseya about the incident on July 5.RELATED NIST charts course towards more secure supply chains for government software",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/revil-ransomware-attackers-demand-70m-following-kaseya-vsa-supply-chain-attack,"['Ransomware', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Zero-day', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Analysis', 'Enterprise', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Authentication', 'Encryption', 'WAF', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"

no,WAF bypass: ‘Severe’ OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set bug was present for several years,High-scoring bug went unnoticed due to time and money constraints,"A vulnerability in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) project that could allow attackers to bypass security mechanisms was present for several years, the maintainers have admitted.The bug – tracked as CVE-2021-35368 – bypasses the security protections offered by the in-built CRS web application firewall (WAF), an advisory warns.This means that malicious request body payloads are able to pass the rule set without being inspected, due to a combination of two bugs in the CRS Drupal rule exclusion package.The vulnerability is not limited to Drupal installations, however, but is present in every CRS installation that includes these rule exclusions – regardless of whether they are enabled or not.Backend weaknesses exposedThe risk to websites depends on their ModSecurity configuration, a write-up details.“If the backend is broken and configured with the correct trailing pathname information setting… then anything is possible. If the backend looks into the trailing path info as it should, then you are on the safe side,” it reads.Christian Folini, co-lead of the volunteer-led Core Rule Set project, told The Daily Swig that the flaw has “been around for several years”.“When we did the early rule exclusion packages in 2016 and 2017 we were not really used to the rule writing techniques that we had to employ,” Folini explained.YOU MAY LIKE CVE board slams Distributed Weakness Filing project for publishing ‘unauthorized’ CVE records“Also [there were] no coding guidelines. And as we [have come] to realize now, nobody has really reviewed this part of the code in the meantime, probably also thanks to the misconception that bugs within the rule exclusion packages would have limited impact since they are disabled by default.“In retrospect, the failure is obvious. The important part now is learning our lesson and adopting our development and review process to avoid such failures in the future.”A deeper lookThe flaw was discovered and reported by Andrew Howe from Loadbalancer.org, who reviewed the ModSecurity engine last year, Folini said.Howe reported the two bugs in the CRS in June. All known CRS installations that offer the predefined CRS rule exclusion packages are affected. This also applies to end-of-life CRS versions 3.0.x, 3.1.0, 3.1.1, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.0 and 3.3.0.Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.1.2, 3.2.1, and 3.3.2, respectively.Discussing the challenges faced by a volunteer-led project such as CRS, Folini pinpointed a lack of financial support as a key barrier. Readmore of the latest open source software security newsFolini said: “Open source is not inherently more secure than closed source – it just means that people can look at the code. Yet the security advantage can only play out when people actually do look at the code, like Andrew Howe did.“If we have these reviews, then the inherent transparency of an open source project will bring an advantage over traditional software, namely in the security domain where users really want to see what is going deep down in their software.“Open source projects also tend to be more open about their shortcomings so they are often able to build up more trust and confidence with their user base. A commercial project is often tempted to avoid bad press by keeping a problem under the rug, or hiding a fix in the changelog.”MUST READ Moving security forward by looking backConducting these reviews is challenging, however, since the project does not have any funds to pay people for their time.“You could say we’re in a bit of Heartbleed situation,” said Folini, referring to the 2014 discovery of an implementation flaw in the widely used OpenSSL cryptographic software library, which went unnoticed due (in part) to a lack of financial support.“CRS is running on over 100 Tbit/s of traffic and most content delivery networks and cloud providers have a commercial offering where they charge for CRS, yet most of them fail to contribute back to our project so far,” he explained.Folini said that the project maintainers have contacted the organizations using CRS, and are calling for help from the “big players”.“Convincing a commercial company from sponsoring something they can get for free is a hard sell,” he explained.“Yet we have subscribed the first real sponsors in 2021 and I hope that the big players will join them.“We have a lot of plans where to take our project, yet many of them are on hold until we find the money and resources to implement them.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Many Hats Club founder announces closure – spelling end for podcast, conference, Discord community",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/waf-bypass-severe-owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set-bug-was-present-for-several-years,"['Industry', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'TLS']"

no,Iranian cyber-threat groups make up for lack of technical sophistication with social engineering trickery,We take a look at the underestimated threat posed by Iran’s state-sponsored hacking groups,"Iranian state-sponsored threat actors are often perceived to be unsophisticated, but security experts quizzed by The Daily Swig warned it would be unwise to underestimate the danger the country poses in cyberspace.The main objectives of Iranian state-sponsored espionage are to target organizations in multiple industries across the world and dissidents or those tagged as enemies of Iran.How do Iranian threat actors compare to groups elsewhere in the world?Nation state-backed Iranian hackers are generally considered to be less advanced than their well-resourced counterparts in Russia or China.Iranian attackers may rarely exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, but what they lack in technical sophistication they make up for in social engineering trickery.For example, they are known to invest considerable effort in developing more elaborate social engineering personas on LinkedIn and elsewhere in order to persuade potentially suspicious targets to open malicious links or attachments.Cyber operations attributed to Iran display a wide range of skill levels, according to threat intelligence experts.Emiel Haeghebaert, associate analyst at Mandiant Threat Intelligence, commented:On the lower end of the skills spectrum, Iran has a large community of hackers active on underground forums. Some of their members engage in politically motivated, disruptive operations such as distributed denial of service attacks, generally considered to be rather unsophisticated, against Iran's adversaries in the Middle East.Meanwhile, mid-level operators target the Iranian diaspora and conduct surveillance of internal opposition groups.“These operations typically rely on social engineering through spear-phishing or SMS messages, and generally follow a predictable pattern of tactics, techniques, and procedures [TTPs],” according to Heghebaert.RELATED Behind the Great Firewall: Chinese cyber-espionage adapts to post-Covid world with stealthier attacksAt the upper end of the scale, “longstanding threat actors like APT34 consistently develop custom malware and use more advanced techniques to compromise their targets, including DNS hijacking and known web exploits”, he added.Threat actors attributed to Russia or China generally display more advanced techniques and better operational security than groups attributed to Iran, according to Mandiant.“This does not necessarily imply, however, that Iranian APT [advanced persistent threat] groups are unsuccessful,” Mandiant’s Heghebaert cautioned.Iranian cybercrime operations ‘typically rely on social engineering and generally follow a predictable pattern’Exercise cautionRafe Pilling, senior information security researcher, Secureworks, agreed that although Iran maintains a competent and effective cyber threat profile, it falls short of Chinese and Russian capabilities.“There is a spectrum of sophistication from Iranian threat groups, with some on par with low-end commercial red teams and others that develop and deploy novel malware of reasonable quality and exercise caution and diligence when in a network,” Pilling told The Daily Swig.“We tend not see zero-day exploits used by Iranian groups, although there has been a history of using SQL injection attacks and web exploits to good effect,” he added.Catch up on the latest cyber-warfare newsIranian threat groups have proved adroit at quickly embracing freshly published exploit code for recently disclosed vulnerabilities.“VPN, Citrix, and RDP vulnerabilities from the last couple of years have been favoured,“ according to SecureWorks.Iranian cyber-espionage campaigns are often delivered via spear-phishing emails, deceiving the target to download weaponised documents or backdoored mobile applications to spy on them, rather than exploiting vulnerabilities on the devices themselves.“Additionally, analysis of the mobile tooling used by these groups suggests a heavy reliance on open source or leaked code,” according to Justin Albrecht, security intelligence engineer at mobile security specialist Lookout.?“Much of the malware we’ve analyzed tied to Iranian APTs feature full RAT capabilities, however they lack many of the modern elements growing in popularity amongst malware developers such as the abuse of Accessibility Services, heavy obfuscation, and packer use. Despite this, our research indicates that their methods are successful based on exfiltrated victim data.”?How are Iranian threat groups evolving?Iran started heavily investing in its cyber operations program following the Stuxnet attack (malware that sabotaged the machinery running nuclear enrichment centrifuges) in 2010.Mandiant’s Heghebaert explained:Iranian cyber operations started as low-level defacements often conducted by the ‘Iranian Cyber Army’. As the government and military cyber programs matured, however, we started observing more advanced activity in line with Iran's strategic priorities.Groups like TEMP.Zagros have recently conducted operations using only publicly available tools, whereas their historic operations relied on a select few custom malware families and malicious macro documents, indicating increased diligence for operational security.We believe that Iran started heavily investing in its cyber operations program following the discovery of Stuxnet in 2010, and we can track the evolution from there.Simultaneously, however, we have seen some indication that Iran is conducting more aggressive operations designed to disrupt their target's networks and day-to-day operations, including through ransomware.Kevin Livelli, director of threat intelligence at RiskIQ, said Iranian attackers have “diversified their TTPs” to make the identification and attribution of their campaigns more difficult.“They are moving away from custom code and backdoors in favour of built-in, ‘living off the land’ techniques and leveraging compromised user credentials,” Livelli said.RECOMMENDED A guide to spear-phishing – how to protect against targeted attacksIran has a history of conducting cyber-attacks through proxy organizations or creating fake group personas to conduct and claim responsibility for attacks – for example, the ‘Cutting Sword of Justice’ group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 Shamoon wiper malware attacks.“There are also indications that Iranian groups are conducting destructive attacks in the Middle East under the guise of ransomware operations using malware including Thanos, Pay2Key, and N3tw0rm,” according to Secureworks.There’s evidence of the growing use of off-the-shelf technology as well as proficiency with native operating system applications.“Legitimate software poses a problem to defenders because it may blend in with any network’s routine operational ‘noise’,” Sean Nikkel, senior threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows, told The Daily Swig.?How are Iranian threat actors organized???Iran’s primary cyber operations are conducted by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), along with affiliated contractors and front companies.The IRGC is a powerful paramilitary organization that’s said to be responsible for disruptive and destructive attacks. The MOIS is a civilian intelligence service focusing on the clandestine acquisition of intelligence.Paul Prudhomme, head of threat intelligence advisory at IntSights, told The Daily Swig: “IRGC and MOIS employees often outsource attacks to non-employees, including Iranian hacktivists and criminals that they have recruited via coercion, compensation, or both.“Some Iranian threat groups operate almost as businesses that sell compromised data to Iranian public sector organisations or have organized themselves as ‘institutes’.”Dozens of high-profile cyber-attacks have been attributed to various Iranian state-backed threat groupsWhat countries and organizations are being targeted by Iranian attackers?Government agencies and defense contractors are top targets for Iranian threat actors because successful breaches can yield political and military intelligence, along with high-value intellectual property.According to threat intel firm IntSights, four countries stand out as prime targets for state-sponsored Iranian attacks: the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.RELATED Russian cybercrooks co-opted Iranian hacking tools to attacks dozens of countries“The US and Israel are top targets due to their longstanding adversarial relationships with the current Iranian government dating back to their support for the former Iranian monarchy and persisting into the present day with their efforts against Iran’s nuclear program,” IntSights’ Prudhomme commented.“Saudi Arabia is another chief regional adversary of Iran due to a variety of political, economic, sectarian, and ethnic factors, including their participation in a regional proxy war in Yemen.“The UAE is a target due to a wider range of factors, including diplomatic and economic tensions, the roles of Dubai and Abu Dhabi as global business and transportation hubs, and the presence of many Iranian expatriates in the UAE,"" he added.What cyber-attacks have been attributed to Iran?Disruption and destruction have been hallmark features of state-sponsored Iranian attacks since 2012-2013.“The Shamoon wiper malware attacks on the national oil and gas companies of Saudi Arabia and Qatar set a precedent for future wiper malware attacks on that sector, primarily in the Persian Gulf, in subsequent years,” according to Prudhomme.“State-sponsored Iranian actors have also targeted water infrastructure, beginning with the industrial control systems (ICS) of New York’s Bowman Dam in 2013, and more recently in a series of attacks on Israeli water infrastructure in 2020.”Other attacks attributed to Iranian groups include DDoS attacks against western banks in 2012 and 2013, sometimes known as ‘OpAbabil’.Attacks against Western universities geared towards stealing research were blamed on Iranian entities and Iranian suspects were named in a 2018 US DoJ indictment.In 2020, Iranian cyber espionage groups also targeted the US presidential election.More recently, Iranian threat actors have been active in targeting firewall and VPN exploits.“Automated mass scanning leads to the deployment of webshells,” according to Secureworks. “The threat actor will then use the webshell to manually triage the victim network later and conduct further activity if the target is of interest.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/iranian-cyber-threat-groups-make-up-for-lack-of-technical-sophistication-with-social-engineering-trickery,"['Deep', 'Dives', 'Iran', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Middle', 'East', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Zero-day', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Analysis', 'Phishing', 'Hacking', 'News', 'DNS', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Organizations', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'OpSec', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Legal', 'Censorship', 'Surveillance', 'US', 'Israel', 'Enterprise', 'Mobile', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Russia', 'Ransomware', 'Government', 'China', 'Social', 'Media', 'Malware', 'OSINT', 'DDoS', 'VPN', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service']"
Yes,Researchers accidentally release exploit code for new Windows ‘zero-day’ bug PrintNightmare,A series of unfortunate events,"Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code has been accidentally released for a previously-unknown bug in the Microsoft Windows Print Spooler.Researchers from Sangfor, a Chinese technology company, are due to present a paper at Black Hat USA on August 4 exploring local privilege escalation (LPE) and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Windows Printer based on prior research into the ancient PrintDemon bug, resolved in 2020.“Although security researchers in the industry have been looking for bugs in Spooler for more than a decade, this year, security researchers at Sangfor discovered multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Spooler,” the company said.TimelineOne of the vulnerabilities due to be discussed, tracked as CVE-2021-1675 and issued with a CVSS score of 7.8, is a critical Print Spooler bug that was included in Microsoft’s latest Patch Tuesday, published on June 8.On June 21, Microsoft revised its previous assessment that the vulnerability was only a privilege escalation issue, upgrading it to an RCE. Credit for finding the issue was given to researchers from Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab, AFINE, and NSFOCUS TIANJI Lab.On June 27, Chinese cybersecurity firm QiAnXin published a video demonstrating both LPE and RCE.As the vulnerability had been publicly upgraded to an RCE and a patch had been issued, Sangfor security researcher Zhiniang Peng then tweeted a link to Sangfor’s own PoC code and a technical write-up for the bug ahead of their Black Hat presentation.However, it appears the vulnerability the PoC relates to – now dubbed “PrintNightmare” – is actually a zero-day that is yet to be patched by Microsoft, and not the vulnerability demoed in QiAnXin’s video.Clean-up operationAfter the code was uploaded to GitHub, the researchers quickly realized their mistake and pulled the PoC, but it was already too late – the exploit had been cloned, forked, and cached.“We deleted the PoC of PrintNightmare,” Peng commented on Twitter. “To mitigate this vulnerability, please update Windows to the latest version, or disable the Spooler service.”The vulnerability is in the RpcAddPrinterDriver call function of the spooler. If a malicious driver is loaded in a vulnerable server, this can grant attackers system-level privileges as long as they can authenticate to the service.Read more of the latest zero-day vulnerability newsAs noted by Sophos, security researchers across Twitter have uploaded screenshots revealing that the vulnerabilities are separate, or at least that the patch is incomplete.Rapid7 researchers have confirmed that the public exploits work against fully patched Windows Server 2019 builds.“The vulnerable service is enabled by default on Windows Server, with the exception of Windows Server Core,” Rapid7 says. “Therefore, it is expected that in the vast majority of enterprise environments, all domain controllers, even those that are fully patched, are vulnerable to remote code execution by authenticated attackers.”Analysis is ongoing.It is likely that Microsoft will need to address the RCE element of the vulnerability separately, potentially in an out-of-band patch. Until then, CERT/CC recommends that the Print Spooler service is stopped and disabled.CISA has also issued an alert.The Daily Swig has reached out to Microsoft with additional queries and we will update when we hear back.READ Zero-day vulnerabilities in Pling leave Linux marketplaces open to RCE, supply chain attacks ",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researchers-accidentally-release-exploit-code-for-new-windows-zero-day-bug-printnightmare,"['Zero-day', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Windows', 'Black', 'Hat', 'China', 'RCE', 'Microsoft', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Asia', 'Social', 'Media', 'US']"

cable for around $30, according to a blog post from Daniel Scheidt, information security consultant at German cybersecurity firm r-tec.Scheidt documented how he did just that, implanting a UNIFY receiver into an innocent-looking USB cable – which, incidentally, would still charge your phone – in order to inject keystrokes.In building this ‘Evil Logitech’ keyboard, the researcher acknowledged the groundwork laid by Luca Bongiorni’s similar USBSamurai, Rogan Dawes’ LOGITacker, which enumerates and tests Logitech wireless input devices for vulnerabilities, and Marcus Mengs’ ‘munifying’, which extracts AES link encryption keys and device RF addresses of paired devices from a Logitech receiver dongle via USB.Read more about ‘Evil Logitech’ USB cableCyrillic keyboard simulation thwarts Russia-affiliated ransomware attacksUnit221B founder Lance James released a Windows batch script to help organizations dupe ransomware into believing they are based in Russian-speaking regions and therefore are less likely to be attacked.The short, clickable script adds a Russian language reference in the Windows registry keys to make it appear that the Windows PC has a Russian keyboard installed, circumventing the need to download relevant script libraries from Microsoft.Most ransomware strains – but certainly fewer malware overall – fail to install if they detect a Russian or Ukrainian keyboard, reflecting the recognition among Russian-affiliated cybercrime gangs that attacks on home soil could spark unwanted attention from Russian law enforcement.Visit the Russian

no,Pandora monitoring system pwned by chained vulnerability exploit,What’s inside the box?,"A security researcher has shown how he was able to chain two vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution (RCE) against Pandora FMS (Flexible Monitoring System).The brace of bugs – discovered by Hungarian security researcher Matek Kamillo – were promptly fixed within a month of notification to developers of the computer network monitoring system, clearing the way for disclosure of technical details.As explained in a detailed technical write-up by Kamillo, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in the visual console component of the software could be combined with a file upload vulnerability to achieve RCE via malicious JavaScript.Booby trapThe file upload vulnerability arises because a “relative path can be used as a directory name”, allowing the bypass of built-in protections that would normally prevent an arbitrary file upload.Exploitation would require an attacker to create a malicious payload in the vulnerable visual console component of the enterprise software before tricking a legitimate administrator into triggering this booby trap. The event would trigger the download of malicious JavaScript and, in turn, the execution of malicious PHP code.The two resolved flaws are tracked as CVE-2021-35501 (XSS) and CVE-2021-34074 (file upload).Catch up with the latest security research newsIf successful, the attack would open a reverse shell on the vulnerable Pandora FMS installation.Both vulnerabilities have been fixed in version 755 of Pandora FMS, released earlier this month.Kamillo’s blog post offers a detailed technical walk through on the vulnerabilities complete with code and demo videos.Keys to the kingdomThe security researcher has history with Pandora FMS, previously discovering a PHP file upload vulnerability via the File Manager.Kamillo told The Daily Swig that monitoring system products have access to multiple systems and store critical information. As such they are an attractive target for hackers (ethical or otherwise) since these “monitoring systems are the key to an entire kingdom”.Existing familiarity with the Pandora FMS product allowed Kamillo to uncover vulnerabilities after half a day’s work.Kamillo added that the flaws he found offered lessons for both pen testers and software developers.“Administrative features are a critical part of any web application,” he explained. “In this case, the border between a web administrator and a console user is not clear. I found multiple file upload vulnerabilities in the same component.”??Kamillo continued: “User input handling is also a critical part of any web application. The XSS vulnerabilities are really dangerous and are widely misunderstood. I heard multiple times the following sentence: ‘It is not serious it is just an XSS’. With JavaScript, it is possible to do a lot of things.”Security source code reviews and penetration tests must be part of every development process, according to Kamillo. “The automated source code review tools are not enough, manual testing is necessary,” he added.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/pandora-monitoring-system-pwned-by-chained-vulnerability-exploit,"['RCE', 'Enterprise', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'XSS', 'JavaScript', 'PHP', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Europe', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Bug Bounty Radar // The latest bug bounty programs for July 2021,New web targets for the discerning hacker,"The ethical hacking community saw a big boost this month, with the news that the US Supreme Court has tightened up the definition of unauthorized access.Previously, penetration testers and ethical hackers ran the risk of being deemed to have violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).Now, though, the court has ruled that the act potentially criminalized “a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity”, and that violations only take place where data is accessed from prohibited files, folders, or databases.In program news, Asian e-commerce giant Lazada has kicked off its first public bug bounty program with YesWeHack, offering up to $10,000 for successful vulnerability reports.And in another first, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has launched a federal civilian security vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) in partnership with Bugcrowd. Researchers are invited to test for vulnerabilities in Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies.Meanwhile, GitHub is aiming to become more bug-hunter-friendly, with an update to its policy on malware and exploit research. Dual-use security research and collaboration on GitHub is now explicitly permitted, though this permission will be withdrawn if abused.In payout news, Indian bug hunter Mayur Fartade has netted $30,000 for revealing a vulnerability in Instagram that potentially exposed victims’ private content. The exploit involved brute-forcing the target’s Media ID and sending a POST request to one of two vulnerable endpoints.There was a $3,000 payout for Nepalese security researcher Samip Aryal, who discovered a vulnerability in Facebook’s Messenger Rooms video chat feature that allowed attackers access to a victim’s private Facebook photos and videos, and to be able to submit posts – even on devices that are locked.And finally, a poll of security researchers who reported vulnerabilities through alternative channels has revealed that many flaws don’t seem to be being patched.Belgium-based bug bounty platform Intigriti found that 12% believed their submission was not successful in reaching security teams, while 19% were unsure about the outcome.The latest bug bounty programs for July 2021The past month saw the arrival of just a few new bug bounty programs. Here’s a list of the latest entries:BunicornProgram provider:HackenProofProgram type:Public bug bountyMax reward:$50,000Outline:Bunicorn, self-described as an automated market-making (AMM) decentralized exchange, is asking security researchers to help prevent loss of user funds by looking for both web security vulnerabilities and smart contract/blockchain flaws.Notes:Bunicorn has included a link to its smart contracts as well as a list of in-scope vulnerabilities. Some of the issues to look out for are any bugs that cause economic-financial attacks, remote code execution attacks, and SQL injection vulnerabilities.Check out the Bunicorn bug bounty page at HackenProof for more detailsElementor (enhanced)Program provider:BugcrowdProgram type:Public bug bountyMax reward:$3,000Outline:Elementor, an open source WordPress plugin, has expanded its public bug bounty program.Notes:The targets for this engagement are the Elementor application, the primary Elementor website, and the Public API.

no,Microsoft Edge Translator contained uXSS flaw exploitable ‘on any web page’,"Exploit tested successfully on Google, YouTube, and Facebook domains","A universal cross-site scripting (uXSS) vulnerability in Microsoft Edge’s translation function left users open to attack, regardless of which website they visited, security researchers have claimed.Netting a $20,000 bug bounty payout for their exploit, the researchers inserted malicious JavaScript into web pages along with text written in a language that was non-native to a target user’s Edge settings.If Microsoft Translator was set to auto-translate or activated by clicking on the relevant prompt, the browser attempted to re-render the page, but failed to render the image tag, triggering an error event and calling the malicious function.	The Chromium-based browser’s security defenses were bypassed with the payload “>img src=x onerror=alert(1)> because the vulnerable StartPageTranslation function failed to sanitize the “>img image tag or perform a validation check that would covert “complete DOM into text and then process it for translation”, reads a blog post published by Vansh Devgan and Shivam Kumar Singh of Indian infosec firm CyberXplore.Pwned in translationSo long as a website reflects a suitable XSS payload, the attack would work, regardless of whether the website properly sanitizes the text, the researchers intimated.The duo validated this hypothesis with a foreign-language YouTube video comment, Google review (proof-of-concept video), and, contingent on acceptance of a friend request, Facebook profile (video).Catch up on the latest browser security newsWeb applications on Microsoft Store were also vulnerable as Microsoft ships the applications with the translator add-on, something also demonstrated in a proof-of-concept video targeting Instagram:Moreover, claims Devgan, if a security researcher were using training labs featuring XSS payloads, these would be triggered when Edge translated the page.Low blowNow patched, the vulnerability (CVE-2021–34506) was classed as medium severity (CVSS 5.4) by Microsoft, despite the huge reward handed out under its Edge bug bounty program.“The bounty seems less [than it should be] and the CVSS seems wrong to me,” says Devgan, who believes a ‘critical’ designation would be more appropriate. “It can actually trigger XSS on any page on [the] entire internet.”Hussein Nasser, the software engineer and hugely popular YouTuber, echoed these sentiments in his video take on the exploit, describing the payout as “low for Microsoft”.In response to queries from The Daily Swig – and from Devgan himself, he claimed – Microsoft declined to comment further on the perceived mismatch between the payout and CVSS score.‘Anything is possible’Devgan and Kumar Singh were inspired to stress-test the function after their efforts to find bugs under Mail.Ru’s Russian-language bug bounty program were frustrated by the removal of several Firefox extensions for translation owing to security vulnerabilities.“I thought these extensions have universal access to any site on [the] browser,” wrote Devgan. “Like if you are on Facebook.com they can access complete DOM of that page, cookies & anything which is possible with JavaScript.”The researchers notified Microsoft of the vulnerability on June 3 and the tech giant issued a patch on June 24.DON’T FORGET TO READ Multiple vulnerabilities in WordPress plugin pose website remote code execution risk",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/microsoft-edge-translator-contained-uxss-flaw-exploitable-on-any-web-page,"['Edge', 'Browsers', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Microsoft', 'India', 'Asia', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'XSS', 'Research', 'Industry', 'News', 'Privacy', 'JavaScript', 'Google', 'Facebook', 'YouTube']"
no,Multiple vulnerabilities in WordPress plugin pose website remote code execution risk,Quartet of critical web security flaws plague CMS software,"UPDATED Multiple vulnerabilities in a popular WordPress plugin used to upload profile photos could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE), researchers warn.Four security issues, which were all assigned a high CVSS score of 9.8, were discovered in May by researchers from Wordfence.These flaws made it possible for an attacker to escalate user privileges and upload malicious code – resulting in the complete takeover of a WordPress site.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsThe plugin in question is ProfilePress – formerly named WP User Avatar – which facilitates the uploading of WordPress user profile images. The technology has more than 40,000 installs, according to Wordfence.Originally, as explained in an advisory from Wordfence, its only functionality was to upload photos, however a recent change saw the plugin augumented with new features including user login and registration.It was flaws in the security of these feature updates that resulted in the vulnerabilities.Privilege escalationThe first issue was a privilege escalation flaw. Wordfence explained: “During user registration, users could supply arbitrary user meta data that would get updated during the registration process.“This included the wp_capabilities user meta that controls a user’s capabilities and role. This made it possible for a user to supply wp_capabilties as an array parameter while registering, which would grant them the supplied capabilities, allowing them to set their role to any role they wanted, including administrator.”There was no way to validate that user registration was enabled on the site, meaning users could register as an administrator even on sites where user registration was disabled.READ ‘LEXSS’ injection: How to bypass lexical parsers by abusing HTML parsing logicAttackers could therefore “completely take over” a vulnerable WordPress site with little effort.Next up comes a privilege escalation bug (CVE-2021-34622) in the user profile update functionality, which used the same method as above, but did require an attacker to have an account on a vulnerable site in order for the exploit to work.“However, since the registration function did not validate if user registration was enabled, a user could easily sign up and exploit this vulnerability, if they were not able to exploit the privilege escalation vulnerability during registration,” according to Wordfence.Malicious uploadsAnother vulnerability present was arbitrary file upload in the image uploader component (CVE-2021-34623). The image uploader in ProfilePress was insecurely implemented using the exif_imagetype function to determine whether a file was safe or not.An attacker could disguise a malicious file by uploading a spoof file which would bypass the exif_imagetype check.This could be exploited to upload a webshell that would allow an attacker to RCE and run commands on a server, achieving complete site takeover.Another arbitrary file upload vulnerability (CVE-2021-34624) in the plugin’s “custom fields” functionality, which also checks for malicious files, could be exploited to achieve RCE.Bug huntingThe researcher who discovered the bug used a tool called WPDirectory to search the WordPress plugin repository for specific lines of code.Chloe Chamberland, Wordfence threat analyst, told The Daily Swig: “I did a routine search for wp_ajax hooks and found that this plugin had introduced some new AJAX actions that I hadn’t previously noticed before, which led to me further investigating them.”Chamberland explained that one of those new AJAX actions was a user registration endpoint, and once she had checked if any arbitrary user meta could be supplied, it led to the discovery of the privilege escalation vulnerability, which was a result of arbitrary user meta being accepted and updated.“That eventually led to the discovery of the arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities since they were also associated with the user registration functionality,” she added.DisclosureThe critical vulnerabilities were reported to WordPress on May 27, and a patch was released by May 30.Wordfence said they “recommend that users immediately update to the latest version available” of WordPress, currently version 3.1.8. Vulnerable versions include 3.0-3.1.3.“I didn’t have to report the issues to WordPress in this case, but rather I was able to work directly with the developer who responded within a few minutes of us reaching out,” Chamberland explained.“This was an ideal case when it comes to reporting the security issues and working with the developer to get patches out.”Aside from updating to the newest version, to protect against the vulnerabilities, she told The Daily Swig: “I would recommend looking for any rogue administrative user accounts in addition to checking or scanning for any uploaded PHP files in the /wp-content/uploads directory.“If any rogue administrative accounts or malicious files are detected, then they should be removed immediately and a full site cleaning should be performed.”This article has been updated to clarify which versions are vulnerable and to include comment from WordfenceYOU MAY ALSO LIKE Instagram vulnerability nets researcher $30k after exposing users’ private content",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress-plugin-pose-website-remote-code-execution-risk,"['WordPress', 'Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'Research', 'Industry', 'News', 'Social', 'Media', 'Hacking', 'News']"
no,"Many Hats Club founder announces closure – spelling end for podcast, conference, Discord community","The infosec community also raised $55,000 for charities and nonprofits","The Many Hats Club (TMHC), the infosec non-profit that produces popular podcasts and conferences alongside a Discord community, is to disband as of today (June 29).Announced on Twitter yesterday by London-based co-founder Stuart Peck, the news spells the end of the TMHC’s podcast, blog, IsolationCon conference, dedicated server for security research collaboration, and Discord channels covering topics such as malware reversing, OSINT, and social engineering.Having founded the community with ‘@buydogs’ in 2017, Peck, director of cyber strategy at ZeroDayLab, tells The Daily Swig that he did not take the decision “lightly” having seen the community achieve “so many positive things that I’m extremely proud of.“Like a lot of communities they rise quickly and sometimes fall, although we were growing there were some challenges internally that lead to a lot of stress for those involved running the community. This stemmed from the pandemic and running so many events, conferences, and podcasts etc.“So, I decided that it was time to end this chapter of the community and let others take what we had done, the lessons, the ethos and bring this to other communities and/or grow their own. He adds: “This has been one of the best experiences of my career and would do it again, albeit differently in the future.”Stellar guestsPeck says TMHC was born of a desire to “take our conversation off Twitter and talk infosec in more detail. We were one of the early infosec communities on Discord and the first to obtain partner status. So essentially, we were learning as we grew.”This growth peaked at a 10,000-strong international membership with 3,000 online at any time, says Peck.The TMHC podcast, which Peck hosted, ran for 95 episodes and featured stellar guests such as Jack Rhysider, Mikko Hyppönen, and John McAFee, who died last week.RELATED Cybersecurity conferences 2021: A schedule of virtual, and potentially in-person or ‘hybrid’, eventsIsolationCon, which ran for two years, featured talks relevant to red, blue, and purple security teams.

A lot [of] TMHC members have no doubt helped me in more ways [than] I could care to admit and have met some incredible people I could easily call friends.”The community’s legacy, Peck said, centers on “the way we helped our own community”, the conferences, and the “$55,000 raised for Doctors Without Borders, Child’s Play, The Diana Initiative, ILF, etc”.He also thanked TMHC’s mods and admins past and present.The ConINT conference, which TMHC co-organized, the V3nari OSINT VM project, and, in read-only mode for a short time, community Discord server, will survive tonight’s shutdown, which is being marked with a party.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/many-hats-club-founder-announces-closure-spelling-end-for-podcast-conference-discord-community,"['Events', 'Industry', 'News', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Hacking', 'News', 'OpSec', 'Social', 'Media', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps']"
no,Call my bluff: NewsBlur RSS software devs offer glimpse into bungled ‘cyber-attack’,Investigation revealed that ‘digital vandals’ fled empty handed,"RSS newsreader NewsBlur was down for 10 hours last week after a criminal hacker attempted – unsuccessfully – to hold its data to ransom.Founder Samuel Clay says he was in the process of transitioning NewsBlur to Docker, when he received a message claiming that the company’s MongoDB database had been deleted and demanding a BTC 0.03 ransom (around $1,000) for the recovery of 250 GB of data.It seems that the transition process had circumvented some firewall rules and left the NewsBlur MongoDB database unprotected.RELATED Binance reveals how data analytics led to ransomware money laundering bust“Turns out the UFW firewall I enabled and diligently kept on a strict allowlist with only my internal servers didn’t work on a new server because of Docker,” says Clay in a blog post.“When I containerized MongoDB, Docker helpfully inserted an allow rule into iptables, opening up MongoDB to the world.”What data breach?Luckily, Clay had retained the original database and was able to take a snapshot and restore the service after a few hours.He was also able to establish, through examining the amount of data transferred and the access logs, that the hackers were bluffing: no data had actually been leaked.Read more of the latest hacking news from around the world“This tells us that the hacker was an automated digital vandal rather than a concerted hacking attempt,” he says.“And if we were to pay the ransom, it wouldn’t do anything because the vandals don’t have the data and have nothing to release.”Clay says that, ironically, the transfer to a virtual private cloud should help make sure that nothing like this can happen again.He also plans to use database user authentication on all databases, and tighten up user permissions.READ ON Security training org EC-Council pulls blog over copyright violations, promises editorial improvements",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/call-my-bluff-newsblur-rss-software-devs-offer-glimpse-into-bungled-cyber-attack,"['Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Network', 'Security', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Analysis', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Authentication', 'Privacy', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Phishing', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Fraud']"
no,Binance reveals how data analytics led to ransomware-linked money laundering bust,Crypto-exchange exploits OpSec mistakes to bust crooks,"The Binance cryptocurrency exchange has explained how advances in data analytics helped it track down a group of money launderers involved with various cybercrimes, including the notorious Clop ransomware scam.Ukrainian police announced the arrest of individuals and the takedown of infrastructure related to the ‘Clop’ ransomware operation earlier this month.Binance’s statement confirms that those arrested were cashing out and laundering funds, rather than being behind the creation of the ransomware.The group – also known as FANCYCAT – had their fingers in numerous criminal scams including laundering money for dark web operators as well as ransomware peddlers.Follow the (digital) moneyAnalogous with drug dealers, the funds extracted from victims through criminal activity such as ransomware need to be disguised before they can be safely spent in the real world to buy goods. That’s because any funds tied back to criminal activity can become the target of forfeiture orders.Even if money is already in digital form there is a need to launder it, with abusing exchanges being one of the main techniques in play.“Blockchain analysis shows a network of money launderers living inside macro exchanges which deposit and withdraw to each other to wash the money,” according to Binance, the Cayman Islands-domiciled crypto exchange.Based on this insight, Binance was able to apply detection mechanisms to identify and interdict suspect accounts before working with law enforcement to build cases and take down criminal groups, as it explained in a blog post about the investigation.We applied the two-pronged approach to the FANCYCAT investigation: our AML detection and analytics program detected suspicious activity on Binance.com and expanded the suspect cluster. Once we mapped out the complete suspect network, we worked with private sector chain analytics companies TRM Labs and Crystal (BitFury) to analyze on-chain activity and gain a better understanding of this group and its attribution.Based on our analysis we found that this specific group was not only associated with laundering Clop attack funds, but also with Petya and other illegally-sourced funds. This led to the identification and eventual arrest of FANCYCAT.We are continuing to investigate the FANCYCAT criminal syndicate across multiple jurisdictions and the connections associated with other cyber-attacks.Earlier this year, Binance released a case study explaining how it worked with the Ukrainian Cyber Police to arrest a major cybercriminal group laundering over $42 million of illicit funds in a separate investigation.All this work against money laundering has not gone far enough for some regulators, who are also concerned about the role of cryptocurrency exchanges in tax evasion.Binance was ordered by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority to stop all regulated activity in the United Kingdom, Reuters reports. Buying and selling cryptocurrencies is not regulated in the UK but trading in derivatives is regulated and it seems to be the activities of Binance Markets in this area that has brought the whole company an unwelcome sanction.BACKGROUND Cybercrooks steal $40m in Bitcoin from crypto-exchange Binance",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/binance-reveals-how-data-analytics-led-to-ransomware-linked-money-laundering-bust,"['Cybercrime', 'Ransomware', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Blockchain', 'OpSec', 'AI', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Fraud', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation']"

In April, the cybersecurity expert called the organization out for the wording on a LinkedIn survey relating to women in cybersecurity that contained discriminatory and misogynistic wording.Speaking to The Daily Swig, Miller said that she will “likely not” pursue legal action as the article has been pulled but criticized the organization’s response as “unsurprisingly poor” by issuing a statement that “refuses to acknowledge the reality of what they did [and] makes every effort to deflect blame away from them”.RECOMMENDED New GitHub repo details legal threats and risks faced by ethical hackers“EC-Council needs a major overhaul to their culture which means it needs to start at the top,” Miller told us.“That executive team needs to change. They need leadership that is committed to serving the security community, not just squeezing every bit of cash they can from it.“Their actions, the plagiarism, the sexism, all show the organization has no respect for our cybersecurity community, and that has to change.

no,Ukrainian man sentenced to prison for his part in billion-dollar FIN7 cybercrime campaign,High-profile threat group sold stolen credit and debit card payment information,"A Ukrainian national has been sentenced to seven years in prison for his involvement in cybercrime group FIN7, which has stolen more than $1 billion from US citizens and organizations.A statement released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) this week named the individual as Andrii Kolpakov, 33, who was arrested in Lepe, Spain, on June 28, 2018, and was extradited to the US on June 1, 2019.Kolpakov, who reportedly worked as a high-level admin for the FIN7 criminal hacking group from 2016 until 2018, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.Alongside his sentence, he was ordered to pay $2.5 million in restitution.Cybercrime campaignAccording to the DoJ release, since at least 2015 members of FIN7 – also referred to as ‘Carbanak Group’ and the ‘Navigator Group’, among other names – engaged in a “highly sophisticated malware campaign”, attacking hundreds of US companies, predominantly in the restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries.Companies that have publicly disclosed hacks attributable to FIN7 include Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chili’s, Arby’s, Red Robin, and Jason’s Deli, said the DoJ.Read more of the latest cybercrime newsThe DoJ said the cybercrime outfit hacked into thousands of computer systems, stealing customer credit and debit card numbers which were then sold on for profit.They used phishing techniques to target business employees, tricking them into opening attachments laden with an adapted version of the Carbanak malware, in addition to an arsenal of other tools, to access and steal payment card data for the business’s customers.US prosecutors said that the gang has been selling stolen payment information through “online underground marketplaces” since 2015.Thousands of victims“In the US alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of businesses in all 50 states and the District of Columbia,” noted the DoJ, adding that the group stole more than 20 million customer card records from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations.Additional intrusions occurred abroad, including in the UK, Australia and France, the DoJ said.RELATED FIN11 uncovered: Hacking group promoted to financial cybercrime elite",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ukrainian-man-sentenced-to-prison-for-his-part-in-billion-dollar-fin7-cybercrime-campaign,"['Cybercrime', 'Legal', 'US', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Malware', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Europe', 'North', 'America', 'Organizations', 'Finance', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Fraud', 'E-Commerce', 'Hospitality', 'Government', 'Retail', 'Cyber-attacks']"
no,Security organizations join forces with EFF to lobby for DMCA reform,‘Good faith’ security research needs shielding from legal blunderbuss,"Security firms and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) are lobbying for reform of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) to protect “good faith” information security research.DMCA, section 1201 – provisions in the controversial US copyright enforcement law relating to the circumvention of copy-prevention systems – “cast a shadow over security research” by suppressing the development of tools and software needed to test security controls.These so-called ‘circumvention tools’ are often needed to find and fix software vulnerabilities, but section 1201 of the DMCA works to suppress the software and tools necessary for that research, according to critics of the law.The specific exemptions written into the act cover government research and reverse engineering, although critics argue that this is inadequate so deeper reform is needed.Industry backingThe EFF and more than 20 security companies are calling for legislators to reform Section 1201 to “allow security research tools to be provided and used for good faith security research”.Security firms backing the EFF in a statement setting out their objections to the DMCA include Bishop Fox, Bugcrowd, HackerOne, McAfee, NCC Group, and Rapid7, among others.Catch up on the latest cybersecurity policy and legislation newsThe process of reform, even if it is ultimately successful, may take some time, so critics of the DMCA are also urging companies and prosecutors to refrain from using section 1201 to unnecessarily target tools used for security research in the meantime.The DMCA includes provisions that prohibit the development or sharing of tools that circumvent technological protection measures (such as bypassing shared default credentials and weak encryption) in order to access copyrighted software without the permission of the software owner.“This creates a risk of private lawsuits and criminal penalties for independent organizations that provide technologies to researchers that can help strengthen software security and protect users,” signatories to the statement argue.“Good faith security researchers depend on these tools to test security flaws and vulnerabilities in software, not to infringe on copyright.”Objections over takedownsSince the law came into effect, in 1998, there have been numerous incidents across multiple platforms where security researchers have been served notices accusing them of hosting content that contravened the DMCA.This threat can be legitimately made against blog posts, YouTube videos, GitHub repositories, and more. Google, for example, does allow recipients of DMCA claims to file counter claims and potentially have pages restored on search engine results.However, security researchers often lack the legal support, time or other resources needed to successfully object to takedown notices.RECOMMENDED US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: What the ‘landmark’ Van Buren ruling means for security researchersOllie Whitehouse, chief technology officer at NCC Group and non-executive director at PortSwigger, told The Daily Swig that issues with the DMCA extended beyond its misuse as a content takedown mechanism.“The issue is that DMCA is used as a legal tool to silence and/or preclude distribution of tooling from good faith security researchers,” Whitehouse explained. “As we know security research can be an uncomfortable truth for some vendors but benefits us all.“The use of the DMCA in this manner is not what was intended and thus the need to ensure it is not used in this way,” he concluded.RELATED Insider PhD: Hacking education channel suspended from YouTube for ‘severe’ guideline violations",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-organizations-join-forces-with-eff-to-lobby-for-dmca-reform,"['Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'US', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Research', 'Google', 'Legal', 'North', 'America', 'Industry', 'News', 'Education', 'Privacy', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'YouTube', 'Compliance', 'Censorship']"
no,‘LEXSS’ injection: How to bypass lexical parsers by abusing HTML parsing logic,Researcher digs deeper into technique that uncovered flaws in popular WYSIWYG HTML text editors,"A security researcher has penned a deep dive on bypassing lexical parsers with special HTML tags that leverage HTML parsing logic to ultimately execute arbitrary JavaScript code.Chris Davis, security consultant at Bishop Fox, has previously deployed the hacking technique to unearth high risk cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in two popular What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) HTML text editors.The flaws in TinyMCE (disclosed in August 2020) and Froala (disclosed earlier this month) affected a combined 700,000 websites that incorporated the applications.What is lexical parsing?“Lexical parsing is a very sophisticated way of preventing XSS because it evaluates whether the data is instructions or plaintext before performing additional logic such as blocking or encoding the data,” says Davis in his technical write-up.It separates “user data (i.e., non-dangerous textual content) from computer instructions (i.e., JavaScript and certain dangerous HTML tags)”, he continues. “In instances where the user is allowed a subset of HTML by design, this type of parsing can be used to determine what is allowed content and what will be blocked or sanitized.”As well as WYSIWYG HTML editors, lexical sanitizing parsers are widely used to protect rich-text editors, email clients, and sanitization libraries such as DOMPurify from XSS attacks.Read more about the latest hacking techniquesHowever, Davis demonstrates how lexical parsers can be tricked into viewing dangerous content “as text data and not computer instructions”.This is possible because “HTML is not designed to be parsed twice; slight variations in parsing can occur between the initial HTML parser and the sanitizing parser; and sanitizing parsers often implement their own processing logic”.Context states and namespace confusionKey to the research are context states: data state categories into which HTML elements are sorted by the HTML parser during tokenization. “Different supplied elements alter how data in those elements is parsed and rendered by switching the context state of the data,” said Davis.The researcher’s ‘LEXSS’ technique also exploits namespace confusion, an area of research impressively furthered by Micha? Bentkowski’s DOMPurify bypass in 2020. “HTML parser will context switch to separate namespaces when it encounters MathML or SVG elements, which can be used to confuse the parser,” said Davis.Conceptualizing XSS riskThe potential impact of XSS attacks varies by context.“In many cases the risk will be nominal and in others catastrophic,” Chris Davis tells The Daily Swig. In the most severe cases, XSS could be exploited “to do things like transfer of funds, execution of financial securities trades or exfiltration of top secret data”.“One way to conceptualize the risk of XSS is to consider when you’re at any website, what could an attacker do if they controlled your actions? As XSS allows that level of control within a site’s origin, generally unbeknownst to the user.”PreventionAs for preventative steps, “when implementing applications that allow some user-controlled HTML by design”, developers should “process the HTML as close to the original parse as possible”, explains Davis.“For organizations that are not creating these types of solutions but rather including them in their applications, a good patch policy will go a long way in preventing exploitation.”Organizations should also “consider implementing a content security policy (CSP) into the application” to “block JavaScript injection at a browser-defined level”.Future researchAsked why he pursued this research avenue, Davis tells The Daily Swig: “This type of context state parsing based analysis is so widespread yet relatively uncovered.“So getting a better understanding of how HTML in general is parsed and how rich-text style editors or sanitization libraries then parse that data and how we can exploit that knowledge was, to me, fascinating.”He adds that he expects similar flaws to surface in “some really impactful targets” such as email clients, and that digging further into HTML parsing could also be fruitful.“I really hope this work aids other researchers in taking it to the next level,” he concludes.RECOMMENDED Misconfigurations in most Active Directory environments create serious security holes, researchers find",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/lexss-injection-how-to-bypass-lexical-parsers-by-abusing-html-parsing-logic,"['XSS', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'JavaScript', 'Browsers', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Industry', 'News', 'Hacking', 'News']"

yes,"Misconfigurations in most Active Directory environments create serious security holes, researchers find",One default configuration deemed problematic failed meet Microsoft’s ‘bar for a security update’,"Common misconfigurations in Active Directory Certificate Services can allow attackers to steal credentials, escalate privileges, and achieve domain persistence, security researchers have found.“In our experience, almost every Active Directory installation we’ve looked at over the last decade has had some kind of misconfiguration issue,” said Lee Christensen and Will Schroeder, Technical Architects at SpecterOps.The researchers have detailed their findings in a comprehensive white paper (PDF) and a blog post, and will present them at this year’s Black Hat USA security conference.Flexibility-complexity trade-offActive Directory Certificate Service (AD CS) is a key component of Microsoft’s public key infrastructure (PKI). It works in concert with other AD services, including Domain Services and Certificate Authority, to manage certificates used in functions such as encryption, message signing, and authentication.Active Directory has been designed to scale to the needs of organizations of various sizes, from single-office, single-domain start-ups with a few developers to large, multinational corporations with dozens of domains, regional offices, and hundreds of thousands of employees. This flexibility has made AD the directory service of choice for the vast majority of Fortune 1000 companies and government agencies.However, AD’s flexibility comes with the trade-off of complexity. There are so many configurations and moving parts it is easy to get things wrong and create security holes.Credential theft, domain persistence, and beyondIn their white paper, Schroeder and Christensen lay out several ways misconfigurations in AD CS can be abused for malicious purposes in three areas:Credential theft by maliciously enrolling users and computers in certificates, and stealing existing certificates. According to the researchers, the credential theft scheme survives password changes and can bypass smart card authenticationPrivilege escalation methods that allow attackers to become any user in the domainDomain persistence attacks that allow attackers to log on as any Active Directory user“These areas of research are not new, and no new vulnerability has been discovered, but no one has looked at all these AD CS issues holistically,” the researchers said. “Also, no one has covered offensive weaponization of these attacks, nor how to detect or defend against these issues.”Catch up on the latest Microsoft security news and analysisGiven AD’s overarching control over the resources of organizations, abusing these vulnerabilities would allow attackers to access Exchange mailboxes, persist in compromised networks for years, distribute malware through companywide update policies, or compromise sensitive data, the researchers warned.“We’re especially concerned about the potential impact to government and other organizations that heavily rely on certificates for user authentication (e.g., smart cards),” they said.Is it a vulnerability?There’s a bit of controversy over whether this is a problem that must be addressed by IT admins or Microsoft.“There is nothing inherently insecure about AD CS,” the researchers said. “These misconfigurations are most likely the results of system administrators and IT enabling certain settings for other valid reasons without understanding the security implications of what they are doing.”The researchers did, however, flag one of the default configurations as a serious security issue. They reported it to the Microsoft Security Response Center, but were told: “We determined your finding is valid but does not meet our bar for a security update release.” Microsoft further said the issue of concern has been detailed and addressed in a post on the MSRC blog.“Based on our extensive experience assessing AD environments, we believe this is very bad. If you find you are vulnerable to this, consider contacting your nearest Microsoft representative and question them as to why this insecure default configuration is allowed,” the researchers wrote in their blog post.The Daily Swig reached out to Microsoft for comments, but a spokesperson said the company has nothing further to add beyond what it said in the blog post.The researchers have released PSPKIAudit, a free tool to audit AD CS for vulnerable configurations.

Information sharing and operational cooperation agreements with private sector entities will be part of what the recommendation foresees for the Joint Cyber Unit.CyberforceNational security is a reserved item normally handled by the governments of member countries.Plans to create a Joint Cyber Unit were first put forward in 2019, but the recent spate of supply chain attacks such as the SolarWinds compromise and the increased severity of ransomware assaults – most recently the Colonial Pipeline attack that hampered the transportation of oil products across the US for days – have sparked the increased urgency.These factors have perhaps served to overcome reservations about delegating powers to a pan-European body in such a sensitive area.The EU’s Commission’s plan – which act as recommendations for national government – call for the establishment of a platform to share information and resources that would draw in help from private sector cybersecurity firms.Read more of the latest security news from across EuropeEarly industry reaction has largely been positive.Raghu Nandakumara, field CTO at cybersecurity vendor Illumio, welcomed the plans.Nandakumara commented: “It’s a logical progression from the 2016 NIS Directive which required individual member states to be appropriately equipped, facilitated strategic cooperation and information exchange, and imbibed a culture of security in sectors critical to the economy and security.”Andrey Yakovlev, a security researcher at threat intel firm IntSights, said that since cybercrime is typically a multi-state operation, it makes sense to have international agencies cooperate to address it. He did, however, caution against setting expectations too high.“This initiative might deter some cybercriminals, but it likely won’t make much of a dent overall,” according to Yakovlev. “We might see more news about European criminals getting arrested, we may hear more news about successful dismantlers of cybercrime infrastructure.”DON’T FORGET TO READ European Commission to hold ‘hackathon’ in bid to secure data sharing across EU",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/eu-pushes-plans-for-joint-cyber-unit-in-fight-against-increased-cyber-attacks,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Europe', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Network', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Ransomware', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Government']"

no,"Zero-day vulnerabilities in Pling leave Linux marketplaces open to RCE, supply chain attacks",Security researcher warns against running PlingStore Electron or visiting affected websites,"A pair of serious zero-day vulnerabilities in Opendesktop’s Pling could result in drive-by remote code execution (RCE) and supply chain attacks against Linux marketplaces based on the platform.Having failed to elicit a response from the project maintainers, security researcher from Berlin-based infosec firm Positive Security disclosed the flaws in a bid to warn users of the threat.Affected Pling-based app stores include appimagehub.com, store.kde.org, gnome-look.org, xfce-look.org, and pling.com.Pling-Store is an installer and content management app for OCS-compatible websites that allows the installation of desktop and icon themes, wallpapers, and mouse cursors within desktop environments such as KDE Plasma, Gnome, and XFCE.‘XSS by design’Recounting how he discovered the flaws, Fabian Bräunlein, security researcher and managing director at Positive Security, says that while testing the KDE Discover app store’s Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) handling, he stumbled across a field allowing users to embed media in a listing. The field, he says, “looked like XSS by design”.Adding an iframe and then a malicious JavaScript payload in a separate line created a stored XSS “that could be used to modify active listings, or post new listings on the Pling store in the context of other users, resulting in a wormable XSS”.Read more of the latest Linux security news and analysisThis, he says, would allow for a supply chain attack whereby a JavaScript payload uploads a backdoored, software version that changes the metadata of the victim’s listings to include the malicious payload.“The XSS is very easy to exploit. Bypassing any protection or filtering was trivial,” Bräunlein tells The Daily Swig. “The stored XSS is triggered simply when someone visits the listing – no user interaction is required.”RCE exploitMeanwhile, Bräunlein found, the native PlingStore application is affected by an RCE vulnerability that can be triggered from any website while the app is running in the background.“During the start, the PlingStore Electron app also launches a component which listens on a local socket for commands. There is no check whether the commands actually come from the Electron app, so any website can send such commands by initiating a WebSocket connection,” he says.“As this component is also used to install applications, some of the commands allow downloading and executing binary files.”TimelineThe disclosure process did not run smoothly – indeed, Bräunlein describes it as “surprising and disappointing”.He first reported the issue via an email sent to Opendesktop on February 24, and followed up repeatedly with further emails, a phone call, a forum post (now locked), and via Pling’s chat service.On 18 June, having received no response, he warned the project maintainers through several of these lines of contact that he was about to go public, finally doing so on 22 June.The Daily Swig has also contacted Opendesktop’s maintainers for comment, and will update this story in the event of a reply.Bräunlein advises users not to run the PlingStore Electron application – or, even better, remove the AppImage file – unless and until the RCE is fixed.And, with any listing on the affected stores capable of hijacking accounts on the platform via XSS, potentially compromising any downloadable assets, users of the affected websites are best advised to log out of their accounts and stay away from the domains unless the issues are remediated.DON’T FORGET TO READ CSP bypass: How one Chrome XSS bug took 2.5 years and an HTML spec change to fix",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-pling-leave-linux-marketplaces-open-to-rce-supply-chain-attacks,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'Linux', 'XSS', 'RCE', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Research', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Network', 'Security', 'JavaScript', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'E-Commerce']"

To register, head to BIG’s website.Aristimuño added: “I think hackathons are really super events where you can feel this great energy come in, and that brings a lot of innovation, but also [brings] very useful outcomes.“You can also network with other likeminded people but also strengthen the community… but also it is an amazing learning opportunity.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Swiss Post launches public bug bounty program with YesWeHack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/european-commission-to-hold-hackathon-in-bid-to-secure-data-sharing-across-eu,"['Industry', 'News', 'Europe', 'Events', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Government', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Organizations', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software']"
no,Asia-Pacific internet registry APNIC says WHOIS admin passwords were mistakenly exposed for three months,Internet org downplays threat to integrity of database,"UPDATED APNIC, the internet address registry for the Asia-Pacific region, has revealed that a “configuration error” meant hashed administrator passwords were publicly accessible for three months.The oversight publicly exposed a dump file of APNIC’s WHOIS SQL database containing hashes of passwords used to authenticate database object changes, “corporate contact details”, and password hashes and contact details related to internal Incident Response Teams (IRTs), said APNIC.Remedial actionsIn a security alert posted on June 18, APNIC (short for ‘Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre’) said the issue arose when its staff copied the database “to a Google Cloud storage ‘bucket’ that was believed to be private”.The member-based non-profit said it rectified the configuration error and removed the dump file after being alerted to the issue by an independent security researcher on June 4.Read more on the latest internet infrastructure news and analysisIt added that it had just completed a four-day process of resetting all maintainer and IRT passwords, some of which were done manually to “minimise disruption to their network operations”.No suspicious activityAPNIC conceded the “possibility that passwords can be derived from the hash by a malicious actor” and WHOIS data potentially “corrupted or falsified for misuse”.The organization added: “It is not known if the data was accessed, as complete log files are not available, however initial investigations reveal no sign of suspicious update activity.”APNIC also downplayed the threat to the integrity of its WHOIS database, a publicly searchable database for internet number resources such as IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, and AS Numbers in the Asia-Pacific region, and contact details of resource holders.“Any public misrepresentation of registry contents on WHOIS would not result in a permanent transfer of IP resources, as these functions are protected by MyAPNIC access mechanisms, and authoritative registry data is held internally by APNIC,” said the security alert.There were also “private WHOIS objects that are not visible on APNIC’s regular public WHOIS service”, whose contents “predominantly consists of corporate contact details”.Tony Smith, communications director at APNIC, told The Daily Swig: “The data contained in the private objects varies, as there were comments added by resource holders in the ‘descr’ and ‘remarks’ attributes. The corporate contact details found in those objects were added by the resource holders.” .Catch up on the latest cybersecurity news from AsiaThis data dates up to October 2017, before which the creation of new private objects in the WHOIS database triggered the incorporation of a duplicate private object in the audit logs.This data “is still being assessed to determine if any further remedial action should be taken” said APNIC.APNIC resource holders have been advised not to reuse their previous password, and to update login credentials for any other accounts where it is being used.MyAPNIC passwords, added the organization, are unaffected and do not need to be changed.APNIC said it is continuing to monitor for evidence of suspicious activity and will implement the recommendations from an ongoing post-incident review “as a priority in the coming weeks”.As well as maintaining the Asia-Pacific WHOIS database, the Brisbane, Australia-based organization distributes and manages IP addresses and AS numbers in 56 Asia-Pacific economies, holds annual conferences focused on internet policy development, and provides internet maintenance training through the APNIC Academy.This article was updated on June 23 with comments from APNIC.RELATED US supermarket chain Wegmans suffers data breach due to ‘misconfigured’ databases",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/asia-pacific-internet-registry-apnic-says-whois-admin-passwords-were-mistakenly-exposed-for-three-months,"['Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Asia', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Certification', 'Organizations', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Oceania', 'Australia', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'China', 'India', 'Logistics', 'Japan', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Pakistan', 'Philippines', 'Singapore', 'South', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'Google', 'Network', 'Security']"

no,"Intent redirection vulnerabilities in popular Android apps spotlight danger of dynamic code loading, warn researchers",Bug could allow a malicious app to steal a plethora of sensitive data from user’s device,"UPDATED Android app developers have been urged not to load code dynamically because of the heightened risk of code execution vulnerabilities.Security researchers issued the warning after disclosing details of an ‘intent redirection’ vulnerability in the Google-for-Android app.“This could have allowed any app installed on the same device to steal arbitrary data from it, for example, accessing a Google account, user’s search history, voice assistant interaction data, mail from Gmail, and to intercept app rights, including access to read and send SMS messages, contacts, call history (as well as making and receiving calls), calendar, microphone, camera, location, Bluetooth and NFC,” reads a blog post from Oversecured, developer of an eponymous mobile app vulnerability scanner.Worse still, “the attacker’s app needed to launch only once for this attack to succeed. After that, even if the app was removed, the malicious functionality would continue to be present in the Google app independently. Moreover, the attack did not require any user consent or notice.”Read more of the latest mobile security newsDespite Oversecured’s warning about the dangers posed, “almost every Android app dynamically loads code from native .iso libraries or .dex files”, a process simplified by libraries such as Google Play Core, said the blog post.“We want to convince developers not to load any code dynamically, because this unsafe practice can escalate a vulnerability that allows stealing/overwriting arbitrary files into critical code execution inside a vulnerable app.”Google fixed the bug in question in May 2021.Oversecured also disclosed details of a similar vulnerability in the TikTok app in September 2020.Malicious IntentThe researchers alighted on a potential problem when, during a probe of Google’s app, they found a content provider with the flag Content-lengthandroid:grantUriPermissions=""true"", containing a handler that could give another app permission to read and write access to arbitrary files.The scan also “indicated that the app uses the Google Play Core library”, meaning “if an attacker wrote an arbitrary module, the classes from the attacker’s module would automatically be added to the ClassLoader of the app”.Explaining intent redirection vulnerabilities, Google says:Apps that extract Intents from the Extras field of an untrusted Intent and launch a component by calling startActivity (or similarly, startService, or sendBroadcast) on an extracted Intent can be tricked into (1) launching an unintended private component which can lead to performing sensitive actions with poisoned arguments, and/or (2) unintentionally launching another app's components, which can lead to having sensitive files stolen through granted URI permissions.Google warningGoogle has warned developers that apps containing intent redirection vulnerabilities will be removed from the Google Play store if they are not patched within a given time frame.The tech giant has advised them to check their Play Console for alerts indicating when apps are affected and, if so, submit patched versions for review in advance of the deadline indicated.Google sets out steps to fixing the bugs in one of three ways: making the app component from which the extracted Intent is redirected private; ensuring that the extracted Intent is from a trustworthy source; or ensuring that the Intent being redirected is not harmful.Sergey Toshin, founder of Oversecured, shared his advice with The Daily Swig.“It's not obvious, but in most cases, libraries (such as widely used Google Play Core or Facebook ImagePipeline) always check normally missing files and then automatically load them if present,” he said.“I would recommend verifying all the app dependencies if they have such built-in functionality (e.g., Oversecured automatically checks such issues). If developers do not intend dynamic code loading, that’s important to get rid of such dependencies. If developers intend it, they should store native libraries in the app’s resources (lib/ folder).”This article was updated on June 21 with comments from Sergey Toshin of OversecuredRELATED XSS flaw in Wire messaging app allowed attackers to ‘fully control’ user accounts",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/intent-redirection-vulnerabilities-in-popular-android-apps-spotlight-danger-of-dynamic-code-loading-warn-researchers,"['Google', 'Android', 'Research', 'Mobile', 'Privacy', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Email', 'Security', 'Surveillance', 'OpSec', 'Vulnerabilities', 'RCE']"
yes,CSP bypass: How one Chrome XSS bug took 2.5 years and an HTML spec change to fix,Browser flaw enabled XSS attacks on protected pages,"The Chromium team has patched a 2.5-year-old bug that made it possible to stage cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on web pages, even if they had been configured to prevent XSS attacks.Discovered by Jun Kokatsu, browser security researcher at Microsoft, the bug allowed crafty attackers to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP), an HTTP header that restricts external resources loaded and run on the web page.Blob attackIn a proof-of-concept, Kokatsu showed that if a web application creates a Blob URL with attacker-controlled data, it could lead to XSS attacks – even if the site is protected with strict CSP policies. Blobs are raw data that can be read as text or streams.Due to the way iframes (embedded HTML pages) inherit headers and policies from their parent page, an attacker could exploit the bug to bypass the CSP rules and execute malicious code on the page.Read more of the latest cross-site scripting (XSS) newsFor example, a recent XSS vulnerability in chat.mozilla.org occurred due to creating a Blob URL from a Blob object passed by an attacker.“This XSS could have been still exploitable even if they had CSP,” Kokatsu told The Daily Swig in written comments.Kokatsu also said that the attack could be staged on other URL schemes, including data: and javascript: URLs.A patch two years in the makingKokatsu discovered the bug in December 2018. It was initially dismissed as something of a non-issue, but the Chromium team later acknowledged its severity and implemented new container security policies in the Chromium specification.“Not many people realize that cross-origin pages can navigate iframes or windows opened by them,” Kokatsu said. “This understanding is required to understand the attack, and the problem space of policy inheritance issues in the CSP’s specification.”Nonetheless, due to its complexity, it took more than two years to get the bug fixed. “CSP needs toinherit policy to local scheme, because those schemes (e.g., about:, blob:, data:, javascript:) don’t have response headers,” Kokatsu said.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/csp-bypass-how-one-chrome-xss-bug-took-2-5-years-and-an-html-spec-change-to-fix,"['Research', 'Browsers', 'Chrome', 'XSS', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Privacy', 'API']"

no,NIST charts course towards more secure supply chains for government software,"Preliminary ideas emerge for more effective, ecosystem-wide standards and guidelines","UPDATED The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has shared a raft of recommendations, submitted by the infosec industry, for bolstering federal agencies’ defenses against the burgeoning threat of software supply chain attacks.NIST is collating suggestions from various tech and infosec organizations with the objective of creating standards and guidelines that will guide the federal government’s approach to software procurement and security.As directed by a recent executive order from President Biden, NIST held a virtual workshop with 1,400 attendees earlier this month, and published 150 papers of recommendations submitted from the likes of Microsoft, Google, and The Linux Foundation.The announcement comes in the wake of a string of high profile supply chain attacks, such as those against SolarWinds and Codecov applications, and a deluge of malicious packages that infiltrated open source repositories through ‘dependency confusion’ in March.READ MORE Open source ecosystem ripe for dependency confusion attacks, research findsDefining ‘critical’As part of the cybersecurity-focused May directive focused on supply chains, the Biden administration called for “more rigorous and predictable mechanisms” for securing “critical” software, in particular.However, industry feedback suggests that even defining ‘critical’ will be challenging.In its response to NIST’s call for papers, for instance, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) said “software and its context of use are inseparable for the purposes of determining the ‘critical’ designation”.Citing use cases for OpenSSH, it added: “A hobbyist web server hosting cat pictures and a nuclear power plant have different ‘...potential for harm if compromised’.”The SEI also warned against adopting a “static” definition for critical software, instead recommending a designation “mechanism” supported by an adapted Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC).SALSAPart of Google's contribution, meanwhile, was an end-to-end framework, called Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA), designed to protect “the integrity of software artifacts throughout the software supply chain”.The tech giant has pitched SLSA as the first framework of its kind to encompass the full development workflow: source-build-publish.Pronounced ‘Salsa’, the framework comprises “incrementally adoptable security guidelines” across four levels – ranging from an automated, provenance-generating build process (SLSA 1) through to a two-person review of changes and “a hermetic, reproducible build process” (SLSA 4).Less is moreThe SEI also suggested that federal agencies should expect to see vulnerability disclosure programs (VDP) and software bills of materials (SBOM) on offer from prospective suppliers.They should also heed the axiom that ‘less is sometimes more’, suggested the SEI: “operating less software and enabling fewer features reduces attack surface”, it said.Vendors were advised to give appropriate notice of end-of-support dates and “proactively mitigate the risk associated with a single, centralized secure [software] update mechanism” – the attack vector at play in both the SolarWinds and NotPetya attacks.Read more about the software supply chain attack news and analysisExisting guidance on these and other areas, added the SEI, was too profuse and ought to be consolidated.On the subject of testing source code, NIST’s workshop summary put forward a recommendation that at least one developer per project “should have security training: specifically, a course where they had to break into a program”.As for choosing tools and technologies, it was suggested that developers use fuzzing as a cost-effective means to pick up elusive, “bizarre cases” of potential vulnerabilities.According to Brian Fox, co-founder and CTO at DevOps automation platform Sonatype, “the NIST proposal is focused on defining minimum requirements for software sold to the government. These requirements will inevitably influence the rest of the industry given the wide scope of software sold to the US government.“The Google proposal, on the other hand, goes beyond minimum requirements and proposes a specific model for scoring the supply chain posture that produced a given component,” Fox tells The Daily Swig. “Those scores will drive people to focus on many key elements that are often ignored such as ‘is the system that built this binary secure?’.“In summary, NIST is currently focused on ‘what’ and Google along with other industry proposals are grappling with ‘how’.”Correction: This article was updated on June 21 to reflect the fact that Google’s proposals were submitted in response to NIST’s call for papers rather than being an entirely separate initiative.RELATED GitLab fixes serious SSRF flaw that exposed orgs’ internal servers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nist-charts-course-towards-more-secure-supply-chains-for-government-software,"['US', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Google', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Research', 'DevOps', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Typosquatting', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Government', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Linux', 'Microsoft', 'North', 'America', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities']"
no,Healthcare vendor Zoll patches high-risk vulnerabilities in defibrillator management software,Anonymous tip-off helps improve healthcare security landscape,"Several high-scoring vulnerabilities in software used to remotely manage defibrillator devices could lead to remote code execution or the loss of sensitive information, US authorities have warned.Developed by Zoll, a US-based healthcare technology vendor, Defibrillator Dashboard allows medical professionals to monitor their ‘fleet’ of defibrillators.Several vulnerabilities were discovered, including an unrestricted file upload flaw (with a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.9), a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug, insecure password storage, and a privilege escalation issue.The flaws were anonymously reported to the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), which then enabled the vendor to develop the necessary patches, an advisory explains.“Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution, allow an attacker to gain access to credentials, or impact confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application,” CISA said.Multiple vulnerabilitiesThe highest-scoring of the Defibrillator Dashboard flaws was an unrestricted file upload vulnerability (CVE-2021-27489). This could allow a non-admin user to upload a malicious file that enables them to remotely execute arbitrary commands.The use of hard-coded cryptographic key (CVE-2021-27481) could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information, while the affected products also contain credentials stored in plaintext (CVE-2021-27487), also allowing access to sensitive information.Read more of the latest healthcare security newsThe XSS flaw (CVE-2021-27479) could allow a low privilege user to inject parameters to contain malicious scripts to be executed by higher privilege users.Unpatched versions of the application allow users to store their passwords in a recoverable format (CVE-2021-27485), which could allow an attacker to retrieve the credentials from the web browser.Finally, an improper privilege management flaw (CVE-2021-27483) contains insecure filesystem permissions that could allow a lower privilege user to escalate privileges to an administrative level user.Update immediatelyThe vulnerabilities have been fixed in the latest version of Defibrillator Dashboard (version 2.2), and customers are recommended to update their software to version 2.2 if they haven’t already.In a statement sent to The Daily Swig, Zoll said it is “important to note that these vulnerabilities pertain to the software-based monitoring solution for defibrillators, not the functionality of defibrillators themselves”.Joseph Carson, chief security scientist at ThycoticCentrify, told The Daily Swig that vulnerabilities such as storing credentials in clear text are “unfortunately all too common”.Carson added: “A CVSS v3 score of 9.9 is very high given it can be exploited remotely and has a low complexity rating. It should go without saying that anyone using this must upgrade as soon as possible.”A Zoll spokesperson said: “Beyond the steps being taken to address this specific issue, Zoll is constantly enhancing its software development security program.“Internal risk assessments and lessons learned from the security researcher community constantly yield improvements, and Zoll’s software development process uses widely integrated code-checking tools that are stronger than ever before.”READ Anatomy of a healthcare data breachSpeaking more generally about how medical staff can protect themselves against vulnerabilities, Christian Espinosa, managing director at Cerberus Sentinel, told The Daily Swig: “Hospitals and clinics should put medical devices on separate VLANs that only allow traffic to/from the device to systems the device needs to communicate with.“This minimizes the risk of the device being compromised and also minimizes the exposure to other hospital and clinic systems if the device is compromised.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Thousands of VMWare vCenter Server instances still unpatched against critical flaws three weeks post-disclosure",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/healthcare-vendor-zoll-patches-high-risk-vulnerabilities-in-defibrillator-management-software,"['Healthcare', 'Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'Secure', 'Development', 'XSS', 'Passwords', 'US', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Research', 'Government', 'Authentication', 'Organizations', 'Hardware']"
no,XSS flaw in Wire messaging app allowed attackers to ‘fully control’ user accounts,Security fixes pushed down the wire,"The maintainers of the Wire secure messaging app have patched the software against two security vulnerabilities, one of which could have allowed an attacker to “fully control” user accounts.Based in Germany with offices in the US, Sweden, and Switzerland, Wire is a free and open source secure messaging platform with commercial options for enterprise customers.After reviewing the platform, independent security researcher Kane Gamble discovered two vulnerabilities impacting the web and iOS versions of Wire.Wire, tappedThe first flaw, present in Wire web app versions 2021-05-10 and earlier, is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue involving the createObjectURL image handler.Tracked as CVE-2021-32683, XSS could be achieved when a user opens an image tainted with extracts of malicious code. In addition to the actual picture, the image’s malicious payload is executed on app.wire.com.Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to masquerade as a compromised Wire user and, according to a related GitHub advisory, “allows the attacker to fully control the user account”.RECOMMENDED GitLab fixes serious SSRF flaw that exposed orgs’ internal servers“Wire didn’t validate whether a real image is uploaded or not, so you could change the content-type to text/HTML, allowing malicious JavaScript to be executed,” Gamble told The Daily Swig.“So, if you upload a valid image with an XSS payload at the bottom, the image is rendered fine. But once opened in a new tab, the XSS is then fired.”The second flaw discovered by the researcher was a less severe denial of service (DoS) issue (CVE-2021-32666) in the iOS version of Wire, where the inclusion of the "" [quotation mark] character in an invalid assetID would crash the client.“When we schedule the request to fetch the invalid asset, it’s not possible to create the URL object since the path contains an illegal URL character,” a related advisory explains.“This will in turn trigger an assertion which crashes the app.”Coordinated disclosureBoth vulnerabilities were subject to a coordinated disclosure process between Gamble and the Wire security team.“The DoS was fixed in version 3.81 and the stored XSS was patched in version 2021-06-01-production.0 [released June 1],” Gamble said.“No update is required by the user other than updating your Wire on your iOS device if it hasn’t done so automatically.”Read more of the latest infosec research newsA Wire spokesperson confirmed that there has been no evidence of active exploitation of either of these bugs in the wild.“The vulnerabilities were responsibly disclosed to us by a vulnerability researcher and after confirming their validity we fixed and released them as quickly as possible,” the spokesperson said.“We also proactively published the vulnerabilities as CVEs for full transparency.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/xss-flaw-in-wire-messaging-app-allowed-attackers-to-fully-control-user-accounts,"['XSS', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Mobile', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Apple', 'Network', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'OpSec', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'API', 'Germany', 'Switzerland', 'US']"
no,GitLab fixes serious SSRF flaw that exposed orgs’ internal servers,DevSecOops,"Programming code-share platform GitLab has fixed a server-side request forgery (SSRF) issue in a software library after the problem was flagged by a security researcher.Server-side request forgery is a class of web security vulnerability that allows, for example, an attacker to force a vulnerable server to make a connection to internal services within an organization’s infrastructure.Researcher ‘Vin01’ discovered that GitLab’s CI Lint API, a library related to code handling and managing developer workflows, was flawed.Catch up with the latest DevOps news and analysisAfter discovering the problem last December, the researcher reported it to GitLab, which responded by publishing a temporary fix in February.GitLab followed up with a more complete patch early this month, clearing the way for Vin01 to publish a detailed technical write-up of their findings.Webhook, line, sinkerThe affected CI Lint API is used to validate CI/CD YAML configuration for GitLab instances. A flaw in the technology, if left unaddressed, created a means for miscreants to steal sensitive info such as passwords and cloud service credentials, Vin01 told The Daily Swig.“Installations which had a particular configuration in place to allow internal network requests from GitLab were vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF), where an attacker could have sent a request to internal servers by jumping from the public facing GitLab servers.“These internal servers are usually not exposed to the internet as they are only meant to be used internally and may contain sensitive information like passwords, API keys, cloud service credentials, which could have been stolen as a result of this vulnerability.”Coordinated disclosurePublic facing GitLab servers are quite common, and the issue in hand was exacerbated because no authentication was required in order to exploit it.The vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2021-22175 and CVE-2021-22214.READ MORE Vulnerability in Microsoft Teams granted attackers access to emails, messages, and personal files“In my research I saw hundreds of vulnerable GitLab servers including but not limited to many open source projects, government departments and universities which use GitLab for hosting their code and integrate it with their infrastructure,” Vin01 added.The security researcher has put together a small script to test if a GitLab server is vulnerable, available on GitHub.Vin01 praised GitLab’s handling of the disclosure process, adding that even though they have since privately warned many affected organizations about their exposure to the flaw, there are still many vulnerable instances.RELATED Security researcher turns Apache Airflow into bug bounty cash cow",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/gitlab-fixes-serious-ssrf-flaw-that-exposed-orgs-internal-servers,"['SSRF', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DevOps', 'Research', 'Organizations', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Passwords', 'Authentication', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Government', 'API', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Enterprise', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks']"
no,Google abandons plans to simplify URLs in Chrome following real-world testing,Grand omnibox experiment failed to hit the mark,"Google has abandoned an experimental plan to hide certain URL elements in Chrome due to a failure to move “relevant security metrics” during testing.The browser-maker has been attempting to simplify URLs in the ‘omnibox’ – Chrome’s address bar – for years, starting with the removal of “trivial subdomains” in 2018, although this was rolled back due to developer backlash.This was followed by an announcement that the ‘www.’, ‘m.’, and ‘https://’ elements would be removed from address bar through an update released in 2019 – a move that also proved controversial.In March 2020, the tech giant attempted to compromise by introducing an experimental feature that allowed users to choose between either simplified or full URLs.Read more of the latest security news about GoogleIn a Chromium thread describing the research, the team said the experiments were focused on improving security – in particular, citing URL display patterns as an inadequate defense against phishing attempts and social engineering.“We’re implementing this simplified domain display experiment so that we can conduct qualitative and quantitative research to understand if it helps users identify malicious websites more accurately,” the developers said.“If the results show that this simplified domain display does help protect users from attacks, then we’ll make a decision about whether to ship it to all users, balancing user feedback with the security considerations.”READ Google Chrome hides www to simplify address barPrototype coding changes were tested in labs, surveys were performed, and the Chrome team said a small percentage of users acted as a test base to “understand if it helps protect them from phishing”.The latest real-world experiment was launched in August 2020 via Chrome 86.It appears, however, that this attempt to simplify the omnibox for security reasons has gone awry. In a revised tracker post dated June 7, Chrome software engineer Emily Stark said, “this experiment didn’t move relevant security metrics, so we’re not going to launch it”.Options to show simplified URLs have now been removed from the browser.CriticismsWhile Google insisted such changes would be potentially beneficial for end users by reducing confusion and their risk of exposure to phishing, critics pointed to looming issues in DNS setups, accidental obfuscation, and domain masking.Speaking to The Daily Swig, CyberSmart CEO Jamie Akhtar said the experiment was an attempt to reduce “cognitive load” in what is often a congested online experience and to make it easier for end users to spot malicious domains.In Akhtar’s view, these experiments should continue, but for now, human intuition and technological solutions such as DNS filtering will have to do.‘A good start’Steve Ritter, CTO at identity verification provider Mitek, told The Daily Swig that the trial was a “good start”, but that as “user feedback showed this approach wasn’t working in their interest [or] making them feel safer, simplifying URLs cannot be seen as beneficial to security”.“With the right technologies in place, digital service providers – messaging apps, mobile manufacturers, email providers, or mobile networks – could warn us when we’re on a suspicious website, rather than attempting to make it easier for us to spot ourselves,” Ritter added.“Businesses must tap into what’s easiest and most intuitive for customers to truly protect them from fraud.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE We want options: Google answers call for full URL presentation in Chrome",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-abandons-plans-to-simplify-urls-in-chrome-following-real-world-testing,"['Google', 'Browsers', 'Phishing', 'Industry', 'News', 'Fraud', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Mobile', 'Email', 'Security', 'Organizations']"

no,US man accused of 2010 DDoS attack on Santa Cruz government arrested,Defendant said to have fled following allegations related to cyber-attack,"A US man alleged to be behind a 2010 DDoS attack on the Santa Cruz County government has been detained – nine years after failing to appear in court.Christopher Doyon, 56, formerly of Mountain View, California, and now a resident of Mexico City, Mexico, was arrested in Mexico earlier this month.He appeared in federal court on Tuesday (June 15) accused of failing to appear at a February 2012 status conference, following his pretrial release in 2011.Doyon is now facing multiple charges related to the 2010 cyber-attack, as well as further charges related to his failure to appear.ChargesDoyon, also known by the handle ‘Commander X’, was previously indicted on charges of conspiracy to cause intentional damage to a protected computer and aiding and abetting intentional damage to a protected computer, according to a US Department of Justice (DoJ) statement.The DDoS attack was allegedly carried out in protest against new restrictions and definitions on camping within Santa Cruz City, California, which were seen as an affront to the city’s homeless population, according to the 2011 indictment (PDF).The indictment claims that Doyon was part of an online group known as the People’s Liberation Front (PLF) which the US courts described as “an online collective of individuals that was associated with collaborative hacking attacks motivated by political and social goals, often referred to as ‘hacktivism’.”PenaltiesDoyon faces stiff penalties if found guilty: a maximum of two years’ imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release for failure to appear after pre-trial release, plus a maximum of five years’ imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000 – plus restitution if appropriate – for conspiracy to cause intentional damage.The maximum statutory penalty for causing intentional damage to a protected computer and aiding and abetting is 10 years’ imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000 – plus restitution if appropriate.The DoJ release reaffirmed that an indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.READ US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: What the ‘landmark’ Van Buren ruling means for security researchers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/us-man-accused-of-2010-ddos-attack-on-santa-cruz-government-arrested,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Legal', 'DDoS', 'US', 'Government', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Cybercrime', 'North', 'America', 'Mexico']"
no,Google open-sources tools to bring fully homomorphic encryption into the mainstream,"Cryptographic expertise not needed to enable computations on encrypted data, says tech giant","Google has released a set of coding utilities that allow fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) operations on encrypted data.The open source collection of libraries and tools allow computational processes to be carried out on encrypted data without first having to decrypt it, offering security and privacy benefits as a result.Homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation are known technologies. Google’s release is largely focused on refining and making them suitable for wider deployment, rather than reinventing the basis for the technologies.Catch up on the latest encryption-related security news and analysis“Our release focuses most on ease of use, cleanly abstracting the various layers of development between design (what the developer is actually trying to do) and implementation (what actually is performed),” a Google spokesperson told The Daily Swig.“The transpiler offers a glimpse into all of these layers, allowing the combined expertise of the crypto, hardware, logical optimization and distributed computing communities to come together in one place.”The suite of tools is available on Github.Use cases: Fully homomorphic encryptionUse cases for homomorphic encryption range from “spell checkers for an email, to updates from wearables, to medical record analysis to, further down the road, things like photo filters or genomic analysis”, according to Google.“The more sensitive or identifying the use case might be, the more important it is that a developer is able to provide strong guarantees on data handling,” the Google spokesperson added.No special expertise in cryptography is required to make use of the search giant’s technology, which is geared towards overcoming a lack of crypto expertise amongst developers that has historically held back wider adoption of such tools.DON’T FORGET TO READ Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: What the ‘landmark’ Van Buren ruling means for security researchersThe trade-off for the privacy benefits of homomorphic encryption is that the mechanism can be more computationally intensive and slower than other methods – an issue not immediately addressed in Google’s release.“Performance remains a significant barrier (one we continue to work on) and so this won’t be a drop-in replacement for all existing cloud services,” the Google representative explained.“At the moment, this environment is aimed at well-scoped problems where data sensitivity is critical or where extra compute cost is worth the added privacy benefit.”Google's approach to fully homomorphic encryption in explained in more detail in a recent white paper (PDF).Professor Alan Woodward, a computer scientist from the University of Surrey, said Google’s FHE tools might be useful across a wide range of applications.“What Google appear to be doing is providing tools to enable FHE across a wide range of areas,” he explained. “Bottom line is that anything where you want the dataset encrypted when in live use, not just encrypted at rest, then FHE could help.”RELATED GitHub changes policy to welcome security researchers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-open-sources-tools-to-bring-fully-homomorphic-encryption-into-the-mainstream,"['Encryption', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Google', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Hardware', 'GitHub', 'Organizations', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Network', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News']"

no,"Vulnerability in Microsoft Teams granted attackers access to emails, messages, and personal files",Security bug in the popular workspace app has been patched,"A vulnerability in Microsoft Teams could allow a malicious actor to steal sensitive data and access a victim’s communications, researchers have warned.The bug, which has now been patched, allowed an attacker to steal a victim’s emails, Teams messages, and OneDrive files, as well as send emails and messages on their behalf.It was discovered by Evan Grant, staff research engineer at Tenable, who detailed the security issue in a blog post released today (June 15).Attack surfaceThe attack relies on a vulnerability in the Microsoft Power Apps tab. Microsoft Teams has a default feature that allows a user to launch small applications (or applets) as a tab in any team they are part of.If that user is part of an Office 365/Teams organization with a Business Basic license or above, they also have access to a set of Teams tabs which consist of Microsoft Power Apps applications, the blog post explains.In an unpatched version of Teams, an actor could set up a malicious tab which, when opened by the victim, would allow them access to their private documents and communications.Read more of the latest security vulnerability news“Furthermore, the attacker could disguise themselves as the victim and send emails and messages on their behalf, potentially allowing them to conduct further social engineering attacks within the organization,” added Grant.“Despite the simplicity of the bug, the attack itself is fairly complicated and requires a working knowledge of the Microsoft Power Apps and Power Automation features.”LimitationsHowever, Grant pointed out, the malicious actor would have to be a member of the Microsoft Teams organization that they are attacking, meaning it would only work in the context of an insider threat attack.More technical details about the bug and a proof of concept can be found in the blog post.Microsoft Teams users are urged to update to the latest version of the software to protect against the vulnerability.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Thousands of VMWare vCenter Server instances still unpatched against critical flaws three weeks post-disclosure",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerability-in-microsoft-teams-granted-attackers-access-to-emails-messages-and-personal-files,"['Microsoft', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DevSecOps', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Email', 'Security', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Research', 'Organizations', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News']"
no,US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: What the ‘landmark’ Van Buren ruling means for security researchers,Industry breathes a sigh of relief as legal threat recedes,"ANALYSIS Following years of consternation, the US legal landscape appears to have tilted decisively in favor of ethical hackers, as a recent Supreme Court decision effectively narrows the scope of what constitutes ‘unauthorized access’ under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).The CFAA dates back to 1986. Although the legislation has been subject to a series of amendments over the years, civil rights groups and computer security professionals have continued to criticize its many perceived shortcomings.Most concerns focus on the law’s scope, with critics arguing that the CFAA has been extended beyond far beyond policymakers’ original objectives when they laid them out more than three decades ago.The CFAA now covers “a broad range of conduct far beyond its original intent”, according to the US National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL).Concerns about the CFAA have centered mostly around the way the act makes use of a computer “without authorization” a criminal offence.Given that there is no accompanying definition of what “authorization” entails, this raises the specter of computer users inadvertently breaking federal law for things like using an application in a way that breaches its license agreement.And the act’s broad provisions makes huge swathes of computer security work, including ethical hacking, penetration testing, and participating in bug bounty programs, fraught with legal risk.BACKGROUND CFAA: How a Supreme Court ruling could have serious ramifications for ethical hackersBut a fresh decision in the Supreme Court relating to Van Buren vs. United States (PDF) limits the act’s scope in a way that could make cybersecurity professionals’ work easier and less anxiety-inducing.As explained by a team of privacy lawyers from Cooley, a California-based legal practice, the Van Buren decision “appears particularly favorable to cybersecurity researchers, whose work often involves accessing computer systems in ways that violate terms of service or other policies”.According to the legal team, the latest Supreme Court decision mitigates the threat to security researchers by “rejecting the view that the CFAA allows criminal penalties for violating circumstance-based access restrictions” and placing more onus on the information that is subsequently obtained.The Daily Swig asked industry experts for their views on the decision and how it may impact information security professionals in both the US and beyond:Jordan LaRose, managing consultant for incident response at F-SecureThe much-maligned CFAA, created nearly 40 years ago when computers were in their infancy, was a constant threat to security researchers and practitioners seeking to exploit and document vulnerabilities for the betterment of cybersecurity.Researchers must always take steps to distance themselves from the constraints of this law with how they pursue and publish their research. At best, this slows process and at worst deters it altogether.Read more of the latest cybercrime newsThe reason this decision is such a landmark for our field and a positive portent for the future is that it contradicts opinions and decisions filed by circuit courts previously that pushed for charges under the CFAA simply because the defendants used software in a way that violated private agreements or corporate policies.In order to understand the mind of a malicious actor, we must often think, act, and develop just as they would. Working in security already creates plenty of paranoia through battling people who could steal your identity or destroy your digital life. Seeing the Court move away from antiquated laws … and promote a healthy cybersecurity community is some of the best news we've had in years.Ben Carr, chief information security officer, QualysThe intent of the law itself, to prosecute hackers, is valid. But its ambiguity has long posed a potential problem for the security industry. A lot of legitimate activity such as ethical hacking or investigation research could technically be in breach of the CFAA, if it were interpreted incorrectly.The debate here centers around who is at fault if someone gains unauthorized access. For example, if a systems designer gave a higher level of access to a user than they were intended to have, it should be considered the fault of the designer rather than the user themselves.RELATED US court offers clarity on evaluating ‘future risk’ injuries in data breach class action litigationThe responsibility should lie with the system’s owner, and this latest ruling appears to support that view. The Supreme Court’s ruling is certainly a step in the right direction to gaining more certainty on the remit of this law, but the ambiguity still remains.We need to deter and prosecute actual [criminal] hackers. If lawmakers can work alongside cybersecurity experts to use their input when scoping out new regulations at the point of their design, this could make the process more effective at catching the bad guys and avoid waiting nearly three decades for clarity. The CFAA is too imprecise to cover all types of cybercrime and attacksCorey Nachreiner, CTO, WatchGuard TechnologiesThe biggest problem with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) is that it is too vague. That vagueness leads to overly broad interpretations and usages of the law in situations that may not apply.The CFAA is too imprecise to cover all types of cybercrime and attacks, but has also been used to prosecute those with ultimately good intentions. For instance, security researchers often test systems by seeing if they can bypass some authorization control. This could be interpreted as “exceeding authorization” by the CFAA. The CFAA could be used to stop this valuable research.Van Buren is [a case] that should prevent litigants from prosecuting users who leverage authorized access for security research or to gather evidence. But it also leaves a legal hole that could allow malicious insiders to get away with bad acts. We need more detailed laws to cover those types of cases.Cyber law does need to exist. The best thing law makers – who generally don’t understand the technical nuances of cybercrime – could do, is to work with the infosec community in helping to craft these laws.Mike Anderson, chief digital and Information officer at NetskopeThe Supreme Court’s majority opinion recognized that violations of the CFAA “would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity”.IT security professionals should look at the Van Buren ruling as an opportunity to thoroughly analyze how they can successfully authorize access to sensitive information to only those who need it most. It will require an even more proactive approach to security measures.The ruling also suggests that penetration testers and ethical hackers will need permission to hack into [sensitive] files to prove they did not exceed authorized access.The federal government has a responsibility to keep its data and systems, and by extension, the country and its citizens safe and secure. And government entities need to be aware of the issues to defend against them.Updated policies around how we communicate vulnerabilities and keep that data safe, particularly for federally sensitive data, are warranted and essential.Additional reporting by James Walker.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/us-computer-fraud-and-abuse-act-what-the-landmark-van-buren-ruling-means-for-security-researchers,"['US', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Cybercrime', 'Legal', 'VDP', 'Industry', 'News', 'North', 'America', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Research', 'Network', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Browsers', 'Compliance', 'OSINT', 'Government', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Analysis', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Fraud', 'Privacy']"

The upshot is that malicious actors can potentially “perform actions allowed by the impacted plug-ins without authentication”, the CVE description reads.Even though a patch was issued by VMware on May 25, research published today (June 15) by SpiderLabs researchers reveals that more than 4,000 vCenter Server instances are still vulnerable to exploitation.Rich pickingsvCenter Server is a centralized management utility used to manage virtual machines, ESXi hosts, and other dependent components.VMware dominates the server virtualization market, with vSphere boasting the greatest market share and vCenter Server ranking fifth, according to Datanyze.Using Shodan, Trustwave security researchers found 5,271 internet-facing instances of VMWare vCenter Server, with nearly four in five (76%) – 4,019 – vulnerable to the flaws based on their self-reported version and use of the vulnerable port.RECOMMENDED Shodan founder John Matherly on IoT security and dual-purpose hacking tools“Patching is a very difficult problem and often complex especially for large organizations,” Karl Sigler, senior security research manager for SpiderLabs threat intelligence at Trustwave, told The Daily Swig. “You have geography and time zone issues. For production systems used by multiple teams, you need to coordinate with those teams for expected downtime. “Many times, patches need to be tested in lab environments prior to being pushed to production systems to verify that the patch won’t cause more issues that they solve.”A further 950 VCenter Server hosts are running even older builds than the vulnerable versions, all bar eight of which are running versions that have reached their end of life.Although SpiderLabs says it has found no in-the-wild exploitation, Troy Mursch, chief research officer of threat intelligence firm Bad Packets, tweeted on June 13 that several hosts were attempting to exploit the RCE flaw in attacks against Bad Packets’ vCenter honeypots.Patches and mitigationsAffected versions include vCenter Server 6.5.0 before 6.5.0 build 17994927, 6.7.0 before 6.7.0 build 18010531, and 7.0.0 before 7.0.2 build 17958471, as well as Cloud Foundation vCenter Server 3.x before 3.10.2.1 build 18015401, and 4.x before 4.2.1 build 18016307.The patched versions of vCenter Server are 6.5 U3p, 6.7 U3n, and 7.0 U2b, while Cloud Foundation was updated in versions 3.10.2.1 and 4.2.1.VMWare has previously issued instructions on how to disable the affected plugins aimed at organizations unable to apply the updates immediately.The RCE flaw was discovered by ‘Ricter Z’ of Chinese infosec firm 360 Noah Lab, with the other flaw detected internally.This article was updated on June 15 with comments from Karl Sigler of Trustwave, and on June 16 to reflect the fact Bad Packets has detected attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities  DON’T FORGET TO READ Security researcher turns Apache Airflow into bug bounty cash cow",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/thousands-of-vmware-vcenter-server-instances-still-unpatched-against-critical-flaws-three-weeks-post-disclosure,"['Enterprise', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'Authentication', 'Organizations', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'TLS', 'China', 'Asia', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'IoT']"
no,Security researcher turns Apache Airflow into bug bounty cash cow,"$13,000 banked through scan and exploit attack methodology","Security researcher Ian Carroll has explained how he was able to exploit outdated Apache Airflow instances to find a series of vulnerabilities and collect more $13,000 in bug bounty payouts.Apache Airflow offers a system for executing workflows, such as “copying and transforming data between data sources”. The technology inherently features web-based interfaces connected to internal databases and other systems.Carroll suspected this was an architecture that offers a wide attack surface, a working assumption that proved more than prescient, as explained in a detailed technical write-up.Catch up with the latest security research newsThe security researcher automated scanning for outdated Apache Airflow instances vulnerable to the previously discovered CVE-2020-17526 vulnerability.Airflow’s web interface relies on Flask’s stateless, signed cookies to handle authentication data. The flaw arose because Airflow bundles a default signing key of temporary_key.Using the flask-unsign tool, an attacker could browse an Airflow instance’s login pages, and capture an unauthenticated cookie before testing if an installation was vulnerable.‘SQLi as a service’By forging the user_id attribute in captured cookies it is possible to pose as an admin, opening the door to all kinds of exploits. For one thing, keys for AWS, payment processors, and databases will often be exposed to the web UI of vulnerable Airflow instances.“You may be able to execute ‘ad-hoc queries’ against connected data sources, even if you cannot read their credentials directly,” according to Carroll. “SQLi as a service!”Carroll was able to use this process to identify a critical vulnerability in a transportation firm’s infrastructure, earning a $4,500 bounty in the process. He later found other similarly vulnerable Airflow installations, earning him a total of $13,000 under HackerOne and Bugcrowd bug bounty programs.The researcher noted: “Smarter companies quickly placed Airflow behind proxies such oauth2-proxy or Duo Network Gateway, which is a strong defense against authentication issues at the application level.

no,Android screen lock protection thwarted by Facebook Messenger Rooms exploit,"Researcher earns $3,000 bug bounty after compromising Facebook accounts on screen-locked devices","A security vulnerability in Facebook’s Messenger Rooms video chat feature meant attackers could access a victim’s private Facebook photos and videos, and submit posts, via their locked Android screen.A user’s Facebook account could be compromised by inviting them to a Messenger Room, then calling, and answering the call from, the target device, before clicking on the chat function – as demonstrated by a proof-of-concept video sent to Facebook with the vulnerability report.Despite requiring physical access to a victim’s device, the attack could be executed without unlocking a target smartphone or tablet and netted Nepalese security researcher Samip Aryal a $3,000 bug bounty.Security bug sequelAryal’s latest find was inspired by a previous, similar Facebook Messenger vulnerability he unearthed in October 2020, whereby users’ private, saved videos and viewing history could be exposed via the Watch Together feature during a Messenger call.RECOMMENDED SIP protocol abused to trigger XSS attacks via VoIP call monitoring softwareAlso exploitable by an attacker with physical access to a locked Android device, the bug was patched along with similar vulnerabilities by forcing users to unlock their phone before using the features in question.Aryal decided to apply the same hacking technique to the Messenger Rooms ‘room call’ function, and discovered that the chat function could also be activated during a call without unlocking the victim’s Android phone or tablet.Unlocking the exploitLogged into a Facebook account via desktop PC, the researcher hosted a Messenger Room and invited an account active on an Android device to join.After joining the room from the ‘malicious’ account, he called the victim’s device from the ‘invited users’ section, and within a few seconds the target, screen-locked device started ringing.“I then picked up the call and tried all previously known sensitive features like ‘watch together’, ‘add people’, etc. but all of them needed to first unlock the phone before using them,” said Aryal.Read more of the latest social media security newsThe breakthrough came when the researcher noticed a prompt to ‘chat’ with fellow room attendees in the top right-hand corner of the call screen.“I found that I could access all private photos/videos on that device without even unlocking the phone,” as well as submit posts “by clicking on the ‘edit’ option for any media”, he said.‘Awesome bounty’Aryal said Facebook’s security team implemented a hotfix for the vulnerability within a day of triage, on the client side “as well as the server-side to also patch it in previous vulnerable versions of messenger”.The size of the “awesome bounty” came as a pleasant surprise given the attack scenario required physical access to the victim’s device, he added – albeit the device’s primary authentication barrier proved to be of little use in this context.The Daily Swig has asked the researcher for further comment.

no,Cybersecurity for charities: How to protect your non-profit from cyber-attacks,"Top tips on thwarting data breaches, ransomware, and more from infosec experts","Cyber-attacks targeted against charities are growing at an alarming rate as cybercriminals take advantage of the huge datasets many non-profits have on file.Charitable organizations often hold sensitive personal data about their supporters and staff, sometimes including financial information.Preventing cyber-attacks against charities isn’t always easy, though, due to constraints around time, money, or technical know-how.However, even the smallest of charitable organizations can help protect their digital assets free of charge, thanks to several free-to-use resources available online.But to understand what your charity needs, first you need to understand why the sector is being disproportionately targeted.Charity casePossibly the biggest security issue charities face is the ever-looming threat of a data breach.Earlier this year, Oxfam Australia announced it had suffered a data breach after a malicious third party gained unauthorized access to the charity’s database.Oxfam has not yet confirmed the number of individuals potentially affected, but it did announce that leaked data included names, addresses, dates of birth, emails, phone numbers, gender, and in some cases historical donation records.Read more of the latest security news about charitiesEven the most security conscious organizations can still fall victim to a data leak due to the risk of third-party failures.A high-profile ransomware attack at fundraising database service Blackbaud in 2020 impacted multiple charities and non-profits that used the platform to collect information on their supporters.Blackbaud said the attacker “removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted (private cloud) environment”, adding that it paid a ransom to have these datasets removed – a practice that is largely frowned upon by infosec experts.While the company said it has no evidence any data was used for criminal purposes, it nevertheless impacted the supporters of multiple charities worldwide, including NHS cancer treatment provider The Christie and US children’s healthcare organization Children’s Minnesota.Charities often hold a wealth of sensitive user data‘Sad reality’David Cummins is vice president of EMEA at Tenable, a US-based cybersecurity company that works with a number of large charities, including a worldwide aid organization.“The sad reality is that cybercriminals are just as likely to target the third sector as any other,” Cummins told The Daily Swig.“A report from the UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport found that 26% of charities had experienced a cyber breach or attack in 2020.“From Tenable’s own analysis of cyber breaches in 2020, known vulnerabilities continue to be the favorite methodology for attackers.“This is why the guidance we offer to our customers, including a number of charitable organizations, is that getting the basics right will thwart the vast majority of cyber threats.”READ MORE Charities, IT service workers most easily hoodwinked by phishing attacks – studyCummins cited user awareness, malware detection, and system backups as key defenses against cybercriminals, though he noted that the “most effective method” is to establish basic cyber hygiene practices that all staff can follow.“This requires organizations to take a holistic view of their infrastructure, identify those assets and systems that are critical to function, determine which vulnerabilities exist within these core areas that are being actively exploited, and update these systems to fix those flaws first,” Cummins added.“In tandem, focus must also be placed on securing accounts – employees, service contractors, temporary workers, systems accounts, and others – and their access to, and permissions across, systems.”Invest in trainingThe Cyber Helpline is a UK-based charity run by volunteers who advise citizens on security issues ranging from phishing attacks to cyber stalking.To ensure the charity can deliver the best advice, and protect itself from attacks, its director told The Daily Swig that it invested in an e-learning platform to deliver up-to-date training/ It also holds regular talks with cybersecurity experts to provide real-life examples of what a security incident can look like.Mark Belgrove, head of cyber consultancy at Exponential?e and founder and director of the Cyber Helpline told The Daily Swig that it is vital that volunteers have the necessary incident response training.He said: “In other words, ensuring that they understand the technical nuances of the digital threat landscape. Once they have this knowledge in place, they will be able to provide the highest standard of support to the victims we work with.”Belgrove added: “This way, our volunteers develop a well-rounded view of the latest developments across the threat landscape as they happen.”Oxfam Australia fell victim to a data breach earlier this yearDON’T MISS Human rights charity leads campaign to stamp out privacy-busting Android appsIn recent years, government security agencies around the world have released free resources for charities and small businesses that contain practical advice on preventing, and responding to, cyber-attacks.The UK’s National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) published its Small Charity Guide and also provides free online advice for the public sector on its website.In Australia, the Governance Toolkit includes a guide to what to look out for and an assessment tool.For US-based charities, US-CERT has an extensive guide on its website that offers security tips for non-technical users.Top tips for improving a charity’s security postureThe Daily Swig reached out to infosec experts with experience in the charity field and asked them what advice they had to help non-profits secure their data.Javvad Malik, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, said: “The first and perhaps most important tip would be from a non-technical perspective, which is to look at the organizational culture. This involves investing in security awareness so that people can make better risk decisions, even if the most sophisticated tools aren’t always available.“The second tip would be to manage credentials. This can involve implementing multi-factor authentication, managing privilege access, or providing employees with password managers.“The third tip would be to stay on top of critical patching, particularly for public-facing and accessible systems.”Brian Higgins, security specialist at Comparitech, who has served as a charity trustee, said: “Add cybersecurity to your charity’s risk register as soon as possible and make it a standing item on the board agenda. This will ensure that the subject is regularly discussed at a senior, decision making and resource allocation level.“Implement a regular and risk-appropriate data backup protocol. Ransomware is one of the most popular criminal methodologies these days, so it’s vital to be able to maintain operations should your network fall victim.“Train all of your staff in security awareness. It’s no good making sure the managers understand phishing if the cleaners don’t know how dangerous it is to plug in a USB they find on the floor!”RELATED Cybersecurity still a major issue for non-profitsNiamh Muldoon, global data protection officer at OneLogin, said it is important to understand the risks the charity is facing by keeping track of its assets, who has access to them, and how they are monitored.In order to protect charities from attacks and breaches, Muldoon offered the following list of best practices: Run an audit of the total number of devices and systems managed Securely dispose of unused and/or old devices Restrict access to others on a need-to-know basis Disable Bluetooth and GPS whenever possible Apply all updates and patches as they become available“Know what you have, know where it is, know what it’s worth, and determine how to protect it,” she said.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE ‘We urge all small charities to take action’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cybersecurity-for-charities-how-to-protect-your-non-profit-from-cyber-attacks,"['Charities', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Cybercrime', 'Organizations', 'Phishing', 'Malware', 'UK', 'US', 'Australia', 'Education', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Government', 'Ransomware', 'Database', 'Security', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Privacy', 'Legal', 'Retail', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Analysis', 'Interviews']"

no,SIP protocol abused to trigger XSS attacks via VoIP call monitoring software,SIP devices could become unwitting access points for remote attacks on critical systems,"The SIP communications protocol can be abused to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, new research has revealedIn a blog post on Thursday (June 10), Enable Security’s Juxhin Dyrmishi Brigjaj said that the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), the technology used to manage communication across services including Voice over IP (VoIP), audio, and instant messaging, can be used as a conduit to perform app-based assaults on software.This includes XSS attacks, in which users’ browser sessions may be compromised, same-origin policies circumvented, and user impersonation may take place for purposes including theft, phishing, or the deployment of malware.XSS entry pointDyrmishi Brigjaj says that in the worst-case scenarios, this could potentially lead to the “unauthenticated remote compromise of critical systems”.The researcher explored the case of VoIPmonitor, an open source network packet sniffer used by system administrators to analyze the quality of VoIP calls based on various network parameters.A vulnerability was discovered in the software’s graphical user interface (GUI) during an offensive security audit.RELATED XSS in the wild: JavaScript-stuffed orders used to compromise Japanese e-commerce sitesOne of the GUI’s features is the monitoring of SIP device register requests. The monitoring system includes the type of device that sent the SIP register message via a User-Agent header value.This value is rendered in the DOM of the user’s web browser. In the hands of miscreants, this may lead to the execution of malicious code.“At face value this might not seem like much, and in the real world I’d use something less obvious, relying on some canary token or callback,” the researcher notes.“However, keep in mind that this code is executed in an administrator’s browser and is stored there for a period of time.”Temporary code executionBrigjaj said that code execution during a short window of opportunity could lead to privilege escalation and full, permanent admin access. This would be done by creating an administrator account by storing a further JavaScript payload in the system.The vulnerability, therefore, could lead to consequences including the exfiltration of data and traffic, the hijack of other administrator accounts, and the deployment of malware such as keyloggers, backdoors, and more.Read more of the latest security research news from about the worldEnable Security reported its findings to VoIPmonitor on February 10 and the security issue was resolved by the project’s developers on February 22 through the inclusion of new XSS protection mechanisms.It is recommended that VoIPmonitor users update to the latest version available, v.24.71.Enable Security tested the patch and confirmed that this avenue to XSS attacks has been removed.The Daily Swig has reached out to the VoIPmonitor project maintainers and we will update this story as and when we hear back.RECOMMENDED Al Jazeera repels cyber-attacks that sought to disrupt media network",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/sip-protocol-abused-to-trigger-xss-attacks-via-voip-call-monitoring-software,"['Vulnerabilities', 'XSS', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Fraud', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Malware', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Secure', 'Development', 'OSINT', 'OpSec', 'Privacy', 'Surveillance', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'JavaScript', 'Browsers']"

no,CVE board slams Distributed Weakness Filing project for publishing ‘unauthorized’ CVE records,Concerns have been raised that the DWF project is causing “confusion” in the community,"The board responsible for overseeing the CVE vulnerability identification program has criticized the DWF project for publishing what it says are “unauthorized” CVE records.The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system is a widely used program for cataloging and tracking security vulnerabilities.Due to the countless vulnerabilities found and reported every day, the Mitre Corporation’s CVE board authorizes organizations to act as CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) which are permitted to assign CVE numbers for bugs.Clearing the backlogThe CVE system aims to provide organizations, researchers, and security specialists the means to track and remedy vulnerabilities, with each disclosed security bug receiving a unique identifier.However, the CVE process has not been without criticism.As far back as 2016, Mitre came under fire for alleged backlogs in CVE assignments, leading to concerns that the program – called by some a “cornerstone” of the industry – could become less relevant in the fight against cybersecurity threats in the future.RELATED CNAs and CVEs – Can allowing vendors to assign their own vulnerability IDs actually hinder security?These complaints led to the creation of the Distributed Weakness Filing (DWF) system.Co-founded by Kurt Seifried and Josh Bressers, DWF is a community-based open source project described as an effort to “modernize and improve the security identifier ecosystem”.The DWF project says that the point of the exercise is to address pain points in the CVE assignment process, as well as improving speed, latency, and volume with the assistance of automation.The CVE program is overseen and operated by Mitre CorporationMistaken identityThere are currently 169 registered CNAs worldwide. The DWF was previously a CNA but no longer acts in this capacity.Additionally, Seifried resigned from his position as a CVE board member in January 2021 due to “a lack of innovation and forward movement”.DWF has previously said that in order to prevent overlaps between itself and the CVE project, the numbers is assigns to vulnerabilities started in the 1000000+ range in the past – and as legacy CVE assignments top out at roughly 17,000 CVEs per year, clashes and confusion should not occur.If existing CNAs began publishing 100,000 CVEs or more on a frequent basis, for example, the DWF said it would move to the 2000000+ range to maintain “significant buffer space”.“This is trivially achieved as the CVE identifier includes the year allowing changes to be made trivially every year,” Seifried says. “This process can of course be repeated assuming legacy CVE assignments grow rapidly.”However, this does not appear to have placated the CVE board, which includes representatives from numerous cybersecurity vendors, academic, researchers, government departments and agencies, and other prominent security experts.Confusion in the communityOn May 27, the organization said the DWF project is not following established CVE program rules, and therefore, any CVE assignments issued by it are not valid and will not be included in the main CVE list.The organization claims the DWF has been causing “confusion” in the community by “infringing on the CVE namespace by issuing IDs using the CVE Program syntax in the CVE-2021-xxxxxxx (million) range”.“The CVE Board wants to make this clear to community stakeholders to eliminate the confusion caused by the unauthorized use of the CVE namespace,” it said.The issue has not been resolved, and on April 2 a further message from the CVE board, directly addressed to the DWF’s co-founders, was published online.RECOMMENDED Google Chrome Web Store is ranking suspicious web extensions above popular pluginsThe organization claims that the DWF has begun “attempting” to issue CVE IDs via its GitHub repository, and that at least eight records have been pushed. But as the project is not a named or approved CNA, issuing CVE IDs is causing “confusion in the CVE contributor and user communities”.Furthermore, the group says that this activity – no matter the numbering order used – could “undermine public trust in the entire CVE system”.“This erosion of trust degrades the CVE community’s ability to provide a free public resource to track vulnerabilities and reduce cybersecurity risk,” the statement reads.To push the matter from the realm of confusion into the legal, the CVE board also says that issuing unauthorized CVE IDs is a “misappropriation” of the CVE brand, unfair competition, and may allegedly be an abuse of a “registered trademark of the Mitre Corporation”.The CVE board has invited DWF to re-apply for CNA status, but in the meantime asks that DWF should cease issuing CVE IDs and “rename all current and future IDs that DWF issues”.The organization told The Daily Swig that the CVE board has been in “direct communication with DWF as well as the broader community regarding DWF’s activities”.Mitre declined to comment further.

no,IoT security: Researchers discover Stem Audio smart speaker eavesdropping risk,"Conference room hardware hack symptomatic of more general malaise, warn security researchers","The increased sophistication of voice-enabled smart speakers, combined with the rise of online meeting technologies such as Zoom has created an increasing and often overlooked IoT security risk.Security researchers at Grimm hacked a Stem Audio Table conference room speaker to illustrate the more general point that the latest cameras and microphones contain built-in processors, leaving them more open to compromise as a result.“What seem like ordinary commodity devices are, in fact, reasonably capable computing machines with attack surfaces very similar to traditional PCs,” according to the researchers.Catch up with the latest IoT security newsAfter examining the Stem Audio Table speakerphone, the researchers said they were able to carry out a remote code execution attack that created the means to eavesdrop on conversations or other exploits within the vicinity of a compromised device.The RCE vulnerability arises because of a stack-based buffer overflow (memory handling) flaw, they said.Researchers also found a command injection vulnerability on the device. The flaw is the result from shortcomings in the sanitization of user-supplied inputs.All of the vulnerabilities were fixed in a security patch released by Stem Audio in June.Conference controlA lack of control interface authentication and shortcomings in encryption were also discovered during testing of the Stem Audio Table, as illustrated in a technical blog post.The issues identified were reported to Shure, which owns the Stem brand. The researchers were told that updates resolve the reported issues.Grimm, the team of researchers who carried out the study, argued that the flaws uncovered were typical of those found in IoT devices.“While Grimm’s research efforts targeted this particular device, the vulnerabilities and design flaws identified by Grimm follow similar patterns to vulnerabilities discovered in other networked Video Teleconferencing devices throughout the small commodity hardware industry,” the researchers said.“As such, similar issues are undoubtedly present in related devices such as VoIP phones, network-connected cameras, and many ‘smart’ devices that are part of the Internet of Things (IoT) space.”RECOMMENDED Dual vulnerability combo in popular CMS Joomla could lead to ‘full system compromise’The Daily Swig approached Grimm to share any red flags that can preemptively help to indicate security shortcomings in IoT devices.In response, a Grimm spokesperson explained: “Determining which tech is actually safe is usually a labor-intensive task by senior researchers, but there are some things that tend to be correlated with more secure products [such as] automatic updates, a way researchers could report issues to the company, security bulletins, [and] firmware availability.”Organizations can protect themselves by following simple mitigations such as unplugging devices when not in use and connecting devices via USB instead of to the network, Grimm advises.RELATED Bluetooth pairing, pwned: Security researchers discover fresh wave of flaws in wireless tech",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/iot-security-researchers-discover-stem-audio-smart-speaker-eavesdropping-risk,"['IoT', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'RCE', 'Hardware', 'Privacy', 'Surveillance', 'OpSec', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Authentication', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Encryption']"
no,Google Chrome Web Store is ranking suspicious web extensions above popular plugins,Privacy add-ons uBlock Origin and AdGuard are among the affected apps,"Suspicious browser extensions are relying on manipulating search results on the Google Chrome Web Store to rank higher than their legitimate counterparts.This is according to the developers of two popular ad-blocking extensions available on the site.Screenshots posted on Twitter this week show that a search result for ‘uBlock Origin’ – a web extension which has more than 10,000 users on Chrome alone – appears below multiple add-ons, some of which, it has been claimed, appear malicious.A test on the Chrome Web Store performed by The Daily Swig confirmed that in a search query for ‘uBlock Origin’, the plugin appears third – below rival applications ‘NBlocker’ and ‘Adtrooper adblocker’.Read more of the latest browser security newsWeighing in on the tweet, Raymond Hill, the developer of uBlock Origin, said: “I’m aware of this [issue].“Even when narrowing to ‘Extensions’ [filter], uBO is listed fourth, after those sleazy extensions (which incidentally are all based on Adblock Plus’ code – with copyright and license notices removed).”Hill added: “No ‘ublock’ used anywhere in the description of these extensions, it’s a mystery as to why they are reported as top matches while uBO is not.”Hill also noted that this issue is not present in the web stores for Firefox or Safari.“Seven years of never breaching user trust counts for nothing in the Chrome Web Store, sleazy extensions which are unrelated to the searched terms are listed first,” he said.Gaming the ecosystem?In a separate test, the developer of AdGuard, Andrey Meshkov, found that while his ad-blocker still came out on top in a search query for ‘Adguard’, a potentially suspicious extension followed closely behind.After taking a further look at the plugin, ‘Adresist adblocker’, could contain malicious code, Meshkov warned.“It loads Google Tag Manager (which allows remote execution of arbitrary scripts) and immediately uses it to load additional scripts: analytics and a script that handles uninstall. Of course, all this does not prove that this extension is malicious,” the developer wrote.However, said Meshkov, the extension also contains little information about the developer, and its privacy policy is hosted on Google Docs rather than a website, leading Meshkov to question its legitimacy.Data privacy risksSpeaking to The Daily Swig, Meshkov said there are numerous reasons why a malicious actor might want to develop a fraudulent web extension.Perhaps unsurprisingly, one prime motivating factor is the desire to secretly siphon sensitive user data, including their browsing history, as well as to embroil users in ad-fraud schemes.“Extensions are really easy to create, they just copy an existing popular open source extension, change the code a little, add their malicious stuff on top of it, and here we go, the malware is ready,” Meshkov added.“What’s even more important, the Chrome Web Store is an awesome distribution channel for them. Being in the search top results allows them to get a lot of people to install their software for free.”RELATED When browser extensions go rogueMeshkov said he has previously contacted Google regarding a similar instance to the Web Store issue, but said that Google does not disclose how its search algorithms work.“They are hiding it to make it harder to manipulate search results,” he said. “Unfortunately, security through obscurity does not seem to be working in this case.”The Daily Swig has reached out to Google for further comment, but we are yet to hear back.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE ‘Being serious about security is a must’ – Apache Software Foundation custodians on fulfilling its founding mission",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-chrome-web-store-is-ranking-suspicious-web-extensions-above-popular-plugins,"['Browsers', 'Privacy', 'Google', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Chrome', 'Industry', 'News', 'RCE', 'Fraud', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Social', 'Media', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Surveillance', 'OpSec', 'Malware', 'Mozilla', 'Apple', 'Safari', 'firefox', 'E-Commerce', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Retail']"
no,Colonial Pipeline cyber-attack: US authorities seize $2.3m in DarkSide ransomware payments,Funds represent a ‘significant portion’ of proceeds for those behind critical infrastructure attack,"The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has seized more than $2.3 million in bitcoin that was allegedly destined to line the pockets of those behind the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack.The funds are said to represent a “significant portion” of the proceeds of a ransom payment to those in the ‘DarkSide’ cybercrime group who targeted Colonial Pipeline in May, resulting in critical US infrastructure being temporarily taken out of operation.RELATED Colonial Pipeline DarkSide ransomware details emerge as US urges vigilanceFeds-in-the-MiddleAfter its corporate IT network was compromised in early May, Colonial Pipeline informed the FBI it had paid a ransom demand of approximately 75 bitcoin ($4.3 million), according to a DoJ news release issued yesterday (June 9).As alleged in a supporting affidavit (PDF), after reviewing the bitcoin public ledger, law enforcement was able to track multiple transfers and “identify that approximately 63.7 bitcoins had been transferred to a specific address”.Read about more of the latest cyber-attacks“This bitcoin represents proceeds traceable to a computer intrusion and property involved in money laundering and may be seized pursuant to criminal and civil forfeiture statutes,” the DoJ said.The FBI was able to extract the funds after obtaining the private key associated with the primary DarkSide bitcoin address.“Despite the extraordinary lengths the criminals took to cover the digital tracks of their ill-gotten gains, FBI San Francisco’s investigative team was relentless and used all technical means to make this seizure,” said FBI special agent, Craig Fair.“Hackers and other cybercriminals simply cannot rely on cryptocurrency to evade the reaches of law enforcement.”Bowing to demandsSpanning nearly 9,000km between Texas and New York, the Colonial Pipeline is the largest pipeline system for refined oil products in the US.In the days following the ransomware attack, unconfirmed reports were circulating that Colonial Pipeline had paid up to $5 million in order to regain access to its systems.The news sparked yet more warnings from both security analysts and the FBI against the payment of ransoms by victim organizations or individuals, for fear of creating a ‘cybercrime feedback loop’.Akin to the prevailing policies that many nations take against refusing to negotiate with those involved in carrying out maritime kidnappings, proponents of the non-payment of ransomware demands say this is the only way to ensure these types of cyber-attacks will cease.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/colonial-pipeline-cyber-attack-us-authorities-seize-2-3m-in-darkside-ransomware-payments,"['Ransomware', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Organizations', 'Malware', 'MitM', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Analysis', 'Legal', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Encryption', 'Government']"
no,‘Being serious about security is a must’ – Apache Software Foundation custodians on fulfilling its founding mission,Board members offer a behind-the-scenes look at the non-profit,"The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is fulfilling its founding mission – developing software that serves the public well – at colossal scale.The non-profit, which is funded by donations and corporate sponsorships, ranks fourth on GitHub by star rating, a barometer of how many developers have bookmarked its projects – surpassed only by Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.Established in 1999, the ASF has around 853 members and 8,200 committers maintaining more than 350 popular, free-to-use open source projects without payment. These include the foundation’s inaugural project, Apache HTTP Server, which powers one in three websites worldwide.Speaking to The Daily Swig, senior figures at the organization gave a glimpse into its inner workings, listing its key strength as its process for handling security vulnerabilities.‘Serious about security’Offering a broad outline of the process, Sheng Wu, one of three recently elected board members, said: “ASF has its security group as a liaison and driver to coordinate with the security issue reporter and the project Project Management Committee (PMC). The security issue should be identified by the project’s PMC with a clear result – accepted or rejected.”Bertrand Delacretaz, a returning director, hails the ASF’s “simple standardized process for handling security vulnerabilities”, citing Apache Sling as a typical exemplar of adherence.“This helps emphasize the fact that being serious about security is a must for ASF projects.”L-R Bertrand Delacretaz, Mark Cox, and Sheng WuContinuous monitoring and consequences for violations, meanwhile, give the process teeth.“Our security team keeps track of all vulnerability reports and provides a list of outstanding ones in their monthly report to the ASF’s Board of Directors,” explains Delacretaz, adding that “not being responsive to security reports can ultimately result in the Board moving a project to our ‘Attic’”.Light touchMark J Cox, the foundation’s vice president of security, emphasizes that clarity and rigor should not come at the expense of agility.“The ASF in general tries to ‘get out of the way’ of projects as much as possible, so when we do have policies that they must follow, like the security handling policy, it’s good to try to make that as easy and lightweight as possible,” he explains.Delacretaz, who is also a PMC member of Apache Incubator, NetBeans, and OpenWhisk, adds: “I think we can be proud of having established such a simple and well-documented process, including guardrails to make sure it is applied. As a programmer who’s not a security specialist I have appreciated the guidance.”Revisiting EquifaxDelacretaz says these processes were stress-tested successfully in relation to the 2017 Equifax security breach, despite the calamitous downstream delays.The ASF demonstrated “that our process had worked and that the key vulnerability in that case had been patched and announced correctly from the Apache Struts side”, he says.Anecdotally, The Daily Swig’s coverage of vulnerability research has revealed that open source projects are often as responsive in remediating vulnerabilities – or more so – than large organizations with significant resources.Sheng Wu, an ASF co-founder along with Cox, points out that by definition, the foundation’s volunteer-driven model means project maintainers are motivated not by a salary, but to make a project “better, more stable, more powerful, and of course more secure”.Delacretaz added that the open source paradigm’s intrinsic transparency creates a helpful incentive.“I think the fact that your work is exposed publicly plays a key role,” he said. “Our open source activities are a living resume – we want that to look good, and in order to sleep well we need to provide great quality software to our users.”‘Blind trust’ in the supply chainThat commitment to quality and security is being severely tested by the burgeoning threat of software supply chain attacks, with the open source ecosystem perilously vulnerable to dependency confusion attacks that can put millions of users at risk.Bertrand Delacretaz worries that “blind trust” is being routinely invested in package developers.“I am worried about how little effort people generally put to verify the integrity of binaries that they download for builds, container images, etc,” he explains, adding that it is everyone’s responsibility to alert colleagues and fellow engineers to the risks and ensure that defensive mechanisms are in place.DON’T MISS Apache Pulsar bug allowed account takeovers in certain configurationsWu says “robust” community models like the ASF’s are best placed to evaluate a project’s (direct at least) upstream dependencies status. “Oe ncevery part of the chain is being watched and secured, the whole open source supply chain is well protected,” says Wu.Mark Cox, who is also a software security engineer at Red Hat, says the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), of which he is a founding board member, is also doing some useful work on tacking the supply chain threat through its working groups.Scoring security issuesThe ASF is one of 168 organizations authorized to assign CVEs to security vulnerabilities.“Our general guiding principle is to assign a CVE to anything that is an actual security vulnerability, independent of the severity or if the issue was found internally or externally,” says Cox, who has created several reports for Red Hat and Apache on how to gauge vulnerability risks.“While it’s tempting to pay a lot of attention every time a vulnerability with a name, cute logo, or domain name [is discovered], branded issues are often not the ones you should be paying attention to.”Echoing concerns recently expressed by Redscan, he also believes it unwise to triage vulnerabilities solely based on their CVSS score.“We generally don’t recommend our projects use scoring systems like CVSS either, as that can create a situation where a user may ignore an issue due to a low score (or indeed have to take actions due to a high score) where that score doesn’t represent how exactly they are using the component and how they configured it.”BACKGROUND CNAs and CVEs – Can allowing vendors to assign their own vulnerability IDs hinder security?The ASF recently launched a web portal that facilitates interaction between Apache projects and the Apache Candidate Naming Authority’s (CNA) security team.“We can use this portal to instantly allocate CVE names from the CVE Project using their new automation API,” says Cox, who says another API in the pipeline will automate the commitment of files to a project’s GitHub repository.This tool truncates the process of publishing a CVE from a few days – or even weeks when errors are made – to a matter of hours.Projects are also now obliged to create a public list of all product versions affected by a CVE.Read more of the latest security vulnerability news“A big part of the challenge of having inventories of components and dependencies in a supply chain is the naming and versioning details, so having machine-readable lists of project versions affected by a given CVE is useful for tool vendors as well as downstream projects and end users,” says Cox.Another problem that needs to be tackled, he continues, is the use of security scanning tools that flag unfixed CVEs and out-of-date dependencies on Apache software, regardless of context.“More often than not it’s the case where the dependency CVE has no impact on our project’s use of that dependency,” he explains.“One way to stop these reports is just to rebase all your dependencies without looking at the underlying issues, but for any complex project with layers of dependencies you can easily get into a cycle of endless dependency updates.“I expect in the coming years this will become more of a problem, and a burden, with the current focus on software bill-of-materials (SBOM).”The Apache WayAsked why he, like thousands of other open source contributors, is willing to volunteer his time to make the internet a better, safer place without financial reward, Delacretaz says: “I love learning so I think it’s how much I have learned from working with the kind of bright, open, and opinionated people that I am interacting with at the ASF.”Cox, an ASF contributor for more than 25 years, says: “While the nature of my participation and time commitment has varied from year to year, I keep getting pulled back to the ASF as the mission, values, and goals of the organization resonate with me.“Those values and the Apache Way are shared by the Apache community, making it a fun, rewarding, and challenging environment.”Shedding more light on the ‘Apache Way’, Wu told The Daily Swig: “ASF delivers the most valuable and widely used open source projects in the world. It always welcomes new people to join and provides help generously.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE GitHub changes policy to welcome security researchers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/being-serious-about-security-is-a-must-apache-software-foundation-custodians-on-fulfilling-its-founding-mission,"['DevSecOps', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Interviews', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DevOps', 'GitHub', 'Industry', 'News', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks']"
no,Dual vulnerability combo in popular CMS Joomla could lead to ‘full system compromise’,"Patch issued for one flaw, but Joomla maintainers contest the severity of a second bug","UPDATED Security researchers have revealed the details of two vulnerabilities in Joomla – the popular content management system – which, if chained together, they said could be used to achieve full system compromise.The two vulnerabilities – a password reset vulnerability and a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw – were both discovered by security researchers at Fortbridge and responsibly disclosed to Joomla’s developers in February and March, respectively.Specific configurationAfter some delays, Joomla released a patch for the XSS vulnerability with version 3.9.27 of the CMS (released in May). The password reset vulnerability - which Fortbridge warns remains unresolved - can be mitigated with a “trusted_hosts” configuration.Fortbridge advises Joomla users to set the ""$live_site"" variable in the configuration.php file as a workaround pending the delivery of a patch for the password reset issue.According to Joomla, however, this HOST-header injection vulnerability requires ""extremely specific circumstances"" that are ""extremely uncommon"" in the Joomla community in order to be exploitable.Combination attackThe two vulnerabilities in Joomla are both high severity and “when chained together they allow an attacker to take over Joomla& website completely”, Adrian Tiron, managing partner at Fortbridge, told The Daily Swig.“Once the attacker has full access to the Joomla website, [they] can upload a PHP shell which will allow [them] to execute commands on the server,” Tiron warned.Catch up on the latest security research newsThe password reset vulnerability allows the attacker to reset an administrator’s password.Tiron explained: “The attacker triggers the password reset process and can manipulate the password reset link to point to the attacker’s server where [they will] capture the victim’s token and reset [their] password once the victim clicks on the link, or the link is fetched by some AV/EDR [anti-virus/ endpoint detection and response] scanning solution.“Once the attacker was able to reset the admin’s password an obtained admin privileges, [they] use the second vulnerability, a stored XSS, to target the ‘Super Admin’ user.”By escalating privileges to ‘Super Admin’, an attacker can gain full access and the ability to run a remote code execution (RCE) attack against a vulnerable Joomla CMS, Fortbridge warns.In response to questions from The Daily Swig, Joomla's developers offered a detailed statement disputing the alleged seriousness of the flaws discovered by Fortbridge:Fortbridge initially reported two separate issues:1. a so-called HOST-header injection2. an attack vector that would ultimately lead to an XSS attack, while requiring the existence of a privileged but non-super admin account on the Joomla installationThe XSS vector has been fixed in Joomla 3.9.27.The HOST-header injection requires extremely specific circumstances to be exploitable, namely a web server setup with either:a) no vhosts being configured orb) a Joomla installation residing in the configured default vhostSuch a setup is extremely uncommon in the Joomla community, as the vast majority of sites are running in shared-hosting environments, where these conditions aren’t met.However, even if a Joomla site is running in such an environment, a Joomla site can already be protected by utilizing the existing $live_site configuration flag in the configuration.php.Fortbridge, which is sticking by its findings, rejected suggestions that the flaws it found only affected obscure configurations and were therefore difficult to exploit.""It requires that Joomla is installed on a dedicated server to be specific (sometimes works in shared hosting),"" according to Fortbridge. ""The big Joomla websites will be on dedicated servers, thus they're the most vulnerable to this issue.""Fortbridge's Tiron concluded: ""Just because the two vulnerabilities require user interaction doesn't make it un-exploitable.""Wider lessonsFortbridge published a detailed technical write-up of its finding this week. Related proof-of-concept code was posted on GitHub.Joomla is one of the most popular  CMS platforms with more than 1.5 million installations worldwide. Fortbridge came across the bugs it discovered in the platform during a penetration testing exercise.Beyond the significance of the findings in their own right they offer lessons to other developers, according to Fortbridge’s Tiron.For one thing the stored XSS flaw would have been preventable through the use of allowlists rather than blocklists. Secondly avoid making password reset links using $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] / $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'], because these “variables are actually user input”, Tiron advised.This story was updated to clarify that the password reset issue remains unresolved, according to security researchers at Fortbridge, and to add comment from Joomla disputing the researchers' findingsRELATED Critical zero-day vulnerabilities found in ‘unsupported’ Fedena school management software",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/dual-vulnerability-combo-in-popular-cms-joomla-could-lead-to-full-system-compromise,"['Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'RCE', 'XSS', 'PHP', 'Passwords', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps']"

no,Critical zero-day vulnerabilities found in ‘unsupported’ Fedena school management software,"Users urged to migrate to alternative application, with open source project long since abandoned","Fedena, an open source school and college management system, contains a raft of zero-day vulnerabilities, with one potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).With the project seemingly abandoned, researchers from UK infosec company Pentest Limited who unearthed the flaws have urged users “to migrate to a supported product as soon as possible”.Seven security vulnerabilities were found in all, including two critical, unauthenticated bugs.Read more of the latest web security research newsWith one, threat actors can “execute commands on the operating system using publicly available tooling and available knowledge”, while an authentication bypass flaw means an attacker can take over the admin account “by cookie spoofing using publicly available knowledge”, according to a Pentest blog post released last week.The root cause of both issues is server-side secrets being “shared between all deployments”.‘Significant vulnerabilities’The other five Fedena flaws, exploitable only by authenticated attackers, relate to SQL injection, broken access controls, and a trio of cross-site scripting (XSS) issues.These “significant vulnerabilities were relatively easy to locate and exploit”, said Pentest.This was particularly concerning given “each exposed installation contains children’s personal information”.RECOMMENDED Korenix patches multiple critical vulnerabilities in networking devicesUpon the 2013 release of the latest, apparently final version, the then maintainers of Fedena said it powered more than 40,000 institutions worldwide – although Pentest researchers said they found only 30 internet-facing instances online in 2020.However, researchers also observed “multiple open source and commercial forks” of concern, with a company called Foradian now selling a commercial version known as Fedena Pro, while a ‘Sampoorna’ fork is apparently maintained for use in Kerala, India by 15,000 schools with more than seven million students.Unfortunately, said Pentest, the vendors involved would not authorize testing.MitigationIn lieu of migration to an alternative platform, Pentest said users could mitigate the critical vulnerabilities by stopping the Fedena application server, altering the secret using a securely generated random string, and restarting the server.The other vulnerabilities could be “significantly” mitigated, meanwhile, by “using network segregation and/or VPN controls” – although Pentest admitted this might cause usability issues.However, Pentest warned that Fedena “relies on seriously outdated Rail Gems”, and regardless of mitigations, “will remain a security risk wherever it is used”.“Migration to a new solution is the only way to [truly] secure unsupported software,” Paul Ritchie, lead researcher on the Fedena flaws, told The Daily Swig. “That is not always practical and may require long term planning.“In the interim”, he says, users should ideally decouple assets from Windows domains to reduce the value to an attacker or use access controls to “limit visibility of the host or service as far as possible”.Disclosure timelineThe flaws were discovered in the latest version of Fedena (v2.3) in April 2020 during one of Pentest’s Hackathon events.ProjectFedena.org did not respond to queries sent by The Daily Swig via its contact form and has not been active on the Fedena GitHub repository in the last eight years.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/critical-zero-day-vulnerabilities-found-in-unsupported-fedena-school-management-software,"['Zero-day', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Education', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'GitHub', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'RCE', 'Authentication', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'XSS', 'Organizations', 'VPN', 'Secure', 'Development', 'UK', 'Europe']"
no,Security vulnerability in Hyperkitty could expose private data,Users of the Mailman newsletter management service should patch now,"Hyperkitty, a web interface for the popular open source mailing list and newsletter management service Mailman, has patched a critical bug that revealed private mailing lists while importing them.“When importing a private mailing list’s archives, these archives are publicly visible for the duration of the import,” according to an advisory on GitHub. This means a malicious actor would be able to download the information during this time.The vulnerability was discovered by Amir Sarabadani, software engineer at Wikimedia Deutschland, while upgrading Wikimedia's mailing lists from Mailman 2 to Mailman 3.“We were upgrading a test mailing list that was private but realized during the upgrade it was public. Once the upgrade was done, the list would become private,” Sarabadani told The Daily Swig.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsA misconfiguration in Hyperkitty caused the partially imported list to be marked as public regardless of its privacy setting in Mailman.Sarabadani said the impact of the bug depends on the mailing list and how large it is. According to the GitHub advisory, upgrades from older versions of Mailman to version three can last more than an hour.“Private mailing lists can contain sensitive information, like publicly identifiable information,” Sarabadani said.“If you communicated publicly that mailing lists are being upgraded [at] certain dates and times as a maintenance window (which you would usually), an attacker can use the opportunity to extract as much private data as possible, especially since Hyperkitty allows you to download all of the archives in batch.”Patch the parcelThe bug was given a severity score of 7.5. The latest version of Hyperkitty has fixed the flaw by obtaining privacy configurations of imported lists from Mailman instead of using default settings.“Don’t take security for granted,” Sarabadani said. “A new software being deployed in your infra, no matter how mature, can still have rather major security issues.”The Daily Swig reached out to the developers of Hyperkitty for comment.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Korenix patches multiple critical vulnerabilities in networking devices",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-vulnerability-in-hyperkitty-could-expose-private-data,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Data', 'Breach', 'GitHub', 'Research', 'Privacy', 'Email', 'Security']"
yes,Microsoft debuts Automatic HTTPS for Edge in secure browsing upgrade,The feature can be used to automatically switch from HTTP to HTTPS,"Microsoft has launched the Automatic HTTPS feature to improve security in its Edge browser.The Redmond giant announced the addition of Automatic HTTPS on June 1. Beginning with Microsoft Edge 92, users can enable the feature to automatically switch from HTTP connections to HTTPS, where available.While currently available to Canary and Development channel participants – alongside “select users” of Edge – the target release for Edge 92 to the beta channel is next week, with an estimated stable channel (mainstream) release date in the third week of July.Edge alerts users to insecure websites with a “not secure” measure displayed on browser tabs, and a lock icon when the HTTPS protocol has been enabled.Automatic HTTPS will switch connections on sites that are “highly likely” to support the secure protocol based on Microsoft telemetry and whitelists. The company says this will “help enable a more secure connection on hundreds of thousands of top domains”.Read more of the latest browser security newsEdge’s new feature is focused on tackling manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks that can allow eavesdroppers to monitor, steal, or tamper with data exchanged over insecure connections.HTTPS mitigates the risk of these forms of attack, and while many websites now support the protocol, fewer mandate a HTTPS connection.Microsoft says that lacking this requirement “leaves open a short window of opportunity for attackers before the site can redirect to the more secure protocol”, and furthermore, some sites do not redirect visitors from HTTP to HTTPS at all, leaving them exposed.The protocol switch has been designed to trigger without intrusive or irritating notifications. More importantly, however, there are two options available when enabling Automatic HTTPS to make sure users can “browse as usual”.READ What the FLoC? Everything you need to know about Google’s new ad tech that aims to replace third-party cookiesThe default upgrade will only enforce secure connections when domains are capable of HTTPS –although as this decision is based on Microsoft scans, there may be a margin of error – in order to reduce the chance of connection errors or performance issues.If users wish to, they can opt-in to switch all connections from HTTP to HTTPS by enabling this choice in Edge Privacy Settings (edge://settings/privacy). Microsoft has warned that this may lead to connection errors occurring more frequently.The success of this feature relies on the allow list compiled by Microsoft through web scanning. The list is based on top domains that are popular and support high levels of traffic – delivered over HTTPS but without requirements in place for the secure protocol – and indicates that connection errors may be more likely to occur with smaller websites that receive less attention if Automatic HTTPS is enabled.Widespread adoptionThe company notes that relying on known-capable domain lists could reduce performance or reliability problems while trying to enforce HTTPS-based browsing, such as those associated with “try HTTPS first and fall back to HTTP” approaches, currently in use by Google Chrome.Since April, the Chrome browser has defaulted to HTTPS for users visiting sites that support HTTPS, and this feature comes into play when handling most typed in addresses. However, Chrome falls back to HTTP when HTTPS attempts fail, such as when there are certificate errors or they are untrustworthy.Mozilla, too, introduced HTTPS-Only Mode in November as part of Firefox 83. This optional feature takes a slightly different approach: if a website does not support HTTPS, the browser displays an error message and will ask for permission before connecting via HTTP.Microsoft emphasizes that the feature is currently experimental and has urged developers to report any issues and submit feedback.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Google and Mozilla unveil plans to bake HTML sanitization into their browsers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/microsoft-debuts-automatic-https-for-edge-in-secure-browsing-upgrade,"['Microsoft', 'Browsers', 'Privacy', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Edge', 'Google', 'Chrome', 'Mozilla', 'firefox', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Network', 'Security']"

But this is not part of the default configuration,” the blog post reads.An unauthenticated attacker could access the devices and potentially carry out miscreant activity such as modifying networking settings, triggering download and upload of configuration files, and initating uploads of new firmware and bootloader files.Multiple flawsA second issue (CVE-2020-12501) present in the devices was multiple backdoor accounts that were found during security checks of firmware files.Researchers also found that the web interface of products was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CVE-2020-12502), allowing potential attackers to modify device settings.Semi-blind command injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-12503) were found on the device series JetNet and the Westermo PMI-110-F2G Managed PoE Gigabit Switch, the blog post details.Due to the lack of CSRF protection, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device by luring the victim to click on a malicious link.YOU MAY LIKE Trend Micro home security guardian beset by triple vulnerability threatFinally, the affected industrial control devices were vulnerable to Arbitrary Unauthenticated Actions (CVE-2020-12504) in multiple devices due to the abuse of their trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP) servers.This TFTP server can be abused to read all files from the system as the software runs as root, resulting in a password hash exposure via the file /etc/passwd.Researchers did note that write access is restricted to certain files including configuration, certificates, boot loader, and firmware upgrades.These various vulnerabilities were recently patched by Korenix. An update to the latest firmware can be found on its website.SEC Consult also noted that Korenix made a number of more general security best practice recommendations including restricting device network access to only trusted parties/devices/network, separating devices from other networks by using firewall system with a minimal number of exposed ports (i.e. network segmentation), and scanning portable computers and removable storage media for viruses before they are connected to those devices.DON’T MISS Akamai offers post-mortem on recently resolved authentication platform vulnerability",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/korenix-patches-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-networking-devices,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Passwords', 'Authentication', 'Windows', 'Research', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'CSRF', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Hardware', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Logistics']"
no,Get the message: Organizations without vulnerability disclosure policies failing to address researchers’ security warnings,Ethical hackers frequently report security flaws outside of VDPs – often to no avail,"Up to a third of all security flaws reported to organizations with no vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) are not being patched due to failings in the disclosure process, a new report suggests.Polled by Belgium-based bug bounty platform Intigriti, 12% of security researchers who reported vulnerabilities through alternative channels believed their submission was not successful in reaching security teams, while 19% were unsure about the outcome.The Ethical Hacker Insights Report 2021 reveals that 70% of ethical hackers have discovered a vulnerability in a system not covered by a VDP.DON’T FORGET TO READ Bug Bounty Radar // The latest bug bounty programs for June 2021And since 12% of those said they didn’t escalate or follow up on their initial report, vendors without VDPs are potentially unaware of up to 44% of zero-day vulnerabilities detected by bug hunters.“Investing in ethical hacking is investing in your company’s reputation,” said Intigriti CEO and founder Stijn Jans.“Running an ethical hacking program can save companies needless security headaches and money, and will empower them to operate online with renewed confidence.”Hit and missWithout having a VDP in place, 50% of researchers’ vulnerability reports are routed through customer service channels, 36% of which failed to reach the security team, according to Intigriti’s survey of more than 1,000 ethical hackers from 140 countries.“Some of the hackers indicated that their reports were closed as spam or were treated as phishing – customer service agents are not trained to handle vulnerability reports and will have a difficult time escalating them to the right person,” Inti De Ceukelaire, head of hackers at Intigriti, tells The Daily Swig.Another 15% attempted to guess the security team’s email address, while 14% sent their findings via social media.Perils of public disclosureWhile public disclosure is deemed to be the most successful method in terms of alerting a vendor’s security team to a security issue, this also potentially exposes their sensitive findings to malicious hackers.In addition, while just 6% of respondents opted for public disclosure, vulnerability reports of this nature still had a one-in-three (31%) chance of failing to reach the target organizations’ security teams.“Public disclosure has shown to be the most effective method to get noticed, but is far from ideal for the affected company and the safety of its users,” says De Ceukelaire. “Direct contacts, such as through LinkedIn or a dedicated security inbox, are the most successful, as they end up with the right person straight away.”Catch up on the latest bug bounty newsThe least successful medium was sending reports through third-party services like computer emergency response teams (CERTs) – 44% of these approaches failed to reach the appropriate team.“The less points of contact a vulnerability report needs to travel through, the better,” says De Ceukelaire. “Third party instances such as the CERT are overwhelmed with external vulnerability reports and may not have the business context to properly assess the severity of a report. “Reaching the right person or team may also be a challenge for them, especially for larger organizations - because some product teams will not take ownership or responsibility to forward vulnerability reports for other teams within the same organization.”Young and eager to learnThe vast majority of ethical hackers – 95% – are male, as well as digital natives, with 51% aged between 18-24 years old and only 13% over the age of 34, according to Intigriti’s latest Ethical Hacker Insights Report.Most (80%) earn their primary income in IT roles such as penetration tester (43%), security analyst (27%), and software developer (6%). Nearly 20% of those polled had at least one of the CEH, OSCP, or OSWE infosec certifications.Money was only the second most popular motivation for ethical hacking – an important incentive for just 63% – with learning new skills the biggest single motivation, cited by 70%.Asked to pick the three most important variables for choosing targets, hackers most frequently chose a broad scope (68%), followed by ‘fresh’ scope (43%), and the promise of dealing with a responsive triage team (42%).Web applications were the most popular technology to probe, followed by mobile, networks, static code analysis, then phishing/social engineering.While hacking is generally seen as a solo endeavor, 91% of researchers said they had either collaborated with peers when bug hunting (30%) or would like to do so in the future (61%).Bug bonanzaIntigriti also revealed that 71% of bug bounty programs receive a report of a ‘high’ or ‘critical’ severity bug within 48 hours of launch, and 37 valid bug reports within a week.One bug hunter told Intigriti: “I think my fastest critical vulnerability find was within 10 seconds – and that was for quite a well-known company that had already done a penetration test.”Inti De Ceukelaire is hosting a free webinar on June 22 to discuss the report.RECOMMENDED ‘Soft skills are the most under-researched area of the bug bounty industry’ – ‘Reconless’ YouTubers on filling a gap in infosec education",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/get-the-message-organizations-without-vulnerability-disclosure-policies-failing-to-address-researchers-security-warnings,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'Research', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Belgium', 'Europe', 'Certification', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Social', 'Media', 'Mobile', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering']"
no,Akamai offers post-mortem on recently resolved authentication platform vulnerability,Lasso bug roped up and corralled by Enterprise Application Access developers,"Akamai has offered a deep dive analysis of a recently patched flaw in its Enterprise Application Access (EAA) access control and authentication platform.EAA allows enterprise users to make access control and authentication decisions based on identity information offered by a third-party identity provider.Developers of EAA took advantage of the Lasso open source library to bolt on support for the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) v2.0 authentication protocol – a technology widely used by identity providers.The reliance on Lasso left EAA exposed to the effects of a recently discovered XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) vulnerability in the library. XML Signature Wrapping is a known class of vulnerability (previous examples here, here, and here).Coordinated responseThe Lasso vulnerability – tracked as CVE-2021-28091 – could allow an attacker to doctor a valid SAML response so that it contains an unsigned SAML assertion.The flaw was given a CVSS score of 8.2, towards the top end of the scale.Catch up on the latest authentication-related security newsIn the case of EAA, the reliance on Lasso set up the preconditions for a possible exploit where an attacker impersonates another user of the targeted system.Exploitation would likely take the form of some form of manipulator-in-the-middle attack or, alternatively, through the abuse of compromised credentials obtained through phishing.Fortunately, incident response experts at Akamai and developers at Lasso were able to work together on a coordinated disclosure process while a patch was developed.Patch developmentThe fix, explained in some depth in Akamai’s technical blog post, involves applying tighter cryptographic checks and controls on what constitutes a valid request.The initial mitigations proposed by developers in February turned out to be incomplete, prompting Akamai techies to suggest a more complete resolution that has since been adopted.Sysadmins who rely on Lasso for their SAML authentication should patch as soon as possible, Akamai advises.RELATED Apache Pulsar bug allowed account takeovers in certain configurations",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/akamai-offers-post-mortem-on-recently-resolved-authentication-platform-vulnerability,"['Authentication', 'Akamai', 'Enterprise', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'MitM', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Research', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Organizations', 'Encryption', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps']"
no,US court offers clarity on evaluating ‘future risk’ injuries in data breach class action litigation,"Second Circuit opinion may have a sizeable impact on the US legal landscape, writes David Oberly","ANALYSIS In McMorris v. Carlos Lopez & Associates, LLC, the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals weighed in on one of the most impactful issues in data breach class action litigation – the threshold for establishing ‘Article III standing’ in the context of allegations of an increased risk of future harm.In doing so, the federal appellate court articulated a non-exhaustive set of factors for consideration when determining whether standing exists for data breach plaintiffs where no actual harm or injury is alleged, which may have significant implications as it relates to the ability of consumers to establish standing in future data breach lawsuits.Overview of Article III standingAs previously reported, ‘standing’ refers to the right to bring a lawsuit in a US federal court.To establish standing under Article III of the US Constitution, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) an injury-in-fact; (2) causation; and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.RELATED Tsao vs. Captiva – How a data breach case could have major impact on the legal definition of ‘harm’Most data breach standing disputes center on the first element, which requires a showing that the injury-in-fact is “concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent.”Where a plaintiff alleges only an increased risk of future harm, standing will exist only if the threatened injury is certainly impending or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.McMorris v. Carlos Lopez & Assocs., LLCThe McMorris case (WL 1603808; 2d Circuit, Apr. 26, 2021) arose out of an errant email sent by an employee of Carlos Lopez & Associates, LLC (CLA) to all company personnel containing the sensitive personal information of then-current and former CLA employees.Following the inadvertent email, three individuals filed suit in connection with the data disclosure event.The plaintiffs did not assert that they had been the victims of fraud or identity theft as a result of the errant email. Rather, they claimed that – because their personal information had been disclosed – they were at imminent risk of suffering identity theft and becoming the victims of impending crimes.They also claimed they were required to spend time (among other things) cancelling credit cards and purchasing credit monitoring services.The Second Circuit’s opinionOn appeal, the Second Circuit held that plaintiffs may establish standing based on an increased risk of identity theft or fraud following the unauthorized disclosure of their data.With that said, the Second Circuit further noted that the fact that plaintiffs may establish standing based on an “increased risk” theory does not mean that they automatically do so in all instances.Rather, an increased risk of identity theft or fraud could be sufficient to establish standing depending on the individual circumstances of the case.In addition, the court rejected the commonly-held belief that a circuit split exists on this issue, finding instead that “no court of appeals has explicitly foreclosed plaintiffs from establishing standing based on a risk of future identity theft – even those courts that have declined to find standing on the facts of a particular case”.Rather, the Second Circuit continued, the courts that have confronted standing in this context have considered certain factors that weigh in favor of finding an injury-in-fact, all of which all bear on whether the risk of identity theft or fraud is “concrete, particularized, and… imminent”.Factors of threeThe court then proceeded to articulate – based on an analysis of decisions issued by its sister courts on the issue – a non-exhaustive set of three factors that should be considered in determining whether plaintiffs have adequately alleged an Article III injury-in-fact based on allegations of an increased risk of identity theft or fraud:Whether the plaintiffs’ data has been exposed as the result of a targeted attempt to obtain that data;Whether any portion of the dataset has already been misused, even if the plaintiffs themselves have not yet experienced identity theft or fraud; andWhether the type of data that has been exposed is sensitive such that there is a high risk of identity theft or fraud.While highlighting the fact that these factors are not the only ones relevant to the standing analysis, the Second Circuit noted that they “provide helpful guidance in assessing whether plaintiffs have adequately alleged an injury in fact”.In addition, the Second Circuit also addressed the issue of whether plaintiffs can establish standing through allegations regarding the cost of taking protective measures to protect themselves following an unauthorized data disclosure.The court answered this question in the negative, holding that where plaintiffs have not alleged a substantial risk of future identity theft or fraud, the time they spend protecting themselves against this speculative threat cannot create an injury.Falling shortWith these principles in mind, the court held that the plaintiffs’ claims presented a “relatively straightforward situation” where the allegations at issue fell short of establishing a substantial risk of future identity theft or fraud sufficient to confer standing.With respect to the first two factors of the Second Circuit test, the court noted the absence of any allegations that the data at issue was intentionally targeted or obtained by a third party, as well as the lack of any allegations that their data was misused as a result of the data disclosure event.READ MORE Colonial Pipeline’s $5m ransomware payment risks perpetuating cybercrime ‘feedback loop’Finally, with respect to the third factor, while the plaintiffs set forth allegations that the personal information disclosed was the type of data that could put the plaintiffs at a substantial risk of identity theft or fraud, without any other facts suggesting that the data was intentionally taken by an unauthorized third party or otherwise misused, these allegations alone were not enough to satisfy the threshold showing needed to establish an injury-in-fact.Taken together, because the plaintiffs did not allege that their data was subject to a targeted data breach or that the data was misused, the Second Circuit held that the plaintiffs failed to establish an Article III injury-in-fact.Implications for data breach class action litigationThe McMorris opinion possesses the potential to have a sizeable impact on the legal landscape of data breach class action litigation.In particular, the articulation of a concrete set of factors for analyzing the issue of standing in the context of “increased risk” injuries may influence how other federal courts analyze the issue of Article III standing in future data breach disputes.Importantly, the three-factor test offers data breach defendants a blueprint for structuring dispositive motions to maximize the likelihood of successfully defeating this ever-increasing type of class action litigation.Conversely, the opinion gives consumers significant ammunition to argue that the increased risk of future identity theft and fraud can be sufficient, by itself, to establish standing – and that there is no circuit split on this issue.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/us-court-offers-clarity-on-evaluating-future-risk-injuries-in-data-breach-class-action-litigation,"['US', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'North', 'America', 'Legal', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cybercrime', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Fraud', 'Privacy', 'Finance']"
no,Spear-phishing campaign linked to SolarWinds attackers halted following domain seizure,APT29 accused of compromising USAID email account,"US authorities have seized two command and control hubs linked to a recent spate of spear-phishing emails that posed as messages from the Agency for International Development (USAID).The court action and enforcement from the US Justice Department follows a warning by Microsoft of malicious activity by the so-called Nobelium Group – the same group of cyber-spies blamed for last year’s infamous SolarWinds hack.RELATED Multiple new flaws uncovered in SolarWinds software just weeks after high-profile supply chain attackNobelium – tracked as APT29 and more commonly known as ‘Cozy Bear’ – is suspected to be a unity of Russian intelligence linked to its Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and associated with its Foreign Intelligence Service (FSB).The web domain seizure enforcement action aims to clamp down on the group’s latest campaign.Compromised accountOn or around May 25, malicious parties abused a compromised USAID account at a legitimate mass mailing service to launch a spear-phishing campaign sent to “thousands of email accounts at over one hundred entities”.These malicious messages purported to contain a “special alert” from USAID which was designed to trick prospective victims into clicking on a link and visiting a malicious site loaded with malware.Catch up on the latest cyber-attack news“The seizure of the two domains was aimed at disrupting the malicious actors’ follow-on exploitation of victims, as well as identifying compromised victims,” according to a US Department of Justice statement on the case.“However, the actors may have deployed additional backdoor accesses between the time of the initial compromises and last week’s seizures.”The attack was ultimately geared towards planting a backdoor on PCs and getting victims infected with the Cobalt Strike attack tool.DEEP DIVE A guide to spear-phishing – how to protect against targeted attacksAs detailed in Microsoft’s blog post, the attack was under development for weeks prior to the mass mailing.For example, in March, the attackers attempted to compromise systems through an HTML file attached to a spear-phishing email, as Microsoft explains:When opened by the targeted user, a JavaScript within the HTML wrote an ISO file to disc and encouraged the target to open it, resulting in the ISO file being mounted much like an external or network drive.From here, a shortcut file would execute an accompanying DLL, which would result in Cobalt Strike Beacon executing on the system.The Cobalt Strike tool received command and control communications via subdomains of theyardservice[.]com, as well as the domain worldhomeoutlet[.]com, the two seized domains.RELATED Ransomware attack on world’s biggest meat supplier JBS ‘came from Russia’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/spear-phishing-campaign-linked-to-solarwinds-attackers-halted-following-domain-seizure,"['US', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Microsoft', 'Russia', 'Malware', 'Email', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'North', 'America', 'Windows', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security']"

no,Apache Pulsar bug allowed account takeovers in certain configurations,Software maintainers downplay real-world impact of JWT vulnerability,"Server messaging and data exchange platform Apache Pulsar has patched a security bug that could allow an attacker to hijack accounts configured in a specific way.A pull request on the Apache Pulsar GitHub reads: “If Apache Pulsar is configured to authenticate clients using tokens based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT), the signature of the token is not validated if the algorithm of the presented token is set to ‘none’. This allows an attacker to connect to Pulsar instances as any user (including admins).”JWT is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties in JSON format. One of the common uses of JWT is user authentication and authorization. Authentication requiredThe bug was initially reported as high severity. But Sijie Guo, a member of the Apache Pulsar Project Management Committee (PMC), told The Daily Swig that the real-world impact of the bug is minimal.“The issue can ONLY allow a token to be authenticated with a NONE signing algorithm,” Guo explained.“An authenticated user doesn’t directly gain access. It will still go through the authorization process, because all the Pulsar roles are NOT predefined.”He added: “Pulsar role names are generated, configured, and managed by the users. Unless the attacker knows your roles, they won’t be able to mock a token to access your cluster.”Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsGuo also said that JWT is not the default authentication mode for Pulsar.“Pulsar provides a pluggable authentication plugin to support different authentication mechanisms,” he said.“It currently supports mutual-TLS, OAuth2, Athenz, Kerberos, and JWT. mTLS and OAuth2 are the popular ones. JWT is only one of them.”Regarding admin users, Guo said that attackers will have to know the username before they can hack them.“Superuser and admin roles are not predefined,” Guo said. “They have to be generated, configured, and managed by Pulsar users.”?Guo also said that a successful exploit – even on an admin user – would not result in more severe attacks on the host system and would remain limited to creating and deleting topics in a given tenant in a Pulsar cluster.RECOMMENDED Gaming development platform Overwolf fixes bug that could allow RCE via chained exploitNonetheless, Guo acknowledges that there should be more caution when integrating new features into the application. “It is important to read the documentation about the third party library we are choosing and use the right method to parse the JWT token,” he said.Peter Stöckli, the security researcher who discovered and reported the bug, told The Daily Swig, “The developers shouldn’t be blamed too much here. They didn’t explicitly specify that ‘none’ can be used as an algorithm.“They basically called the wrong method on the JWT-library in use. The JWT-library cannot be blamed too much, since the use of the ‘none’ algorithm is part of the standard (unsecured JWTs).”The bug, fixed in the latest version of Pulsar (2.7.1), had existed since version 2.5.1, which introduced the JWT authentication provider option.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/apache-pulsar-bug-allowed-account-takeovers-in-certain-configurations,"['GitHub', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Authentication', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Encryption', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks']"
no,Gaming mod development platform Overwolf fixes bug that could allow RCE via chained exploit,Researchers used custom URL schemes to achieve XSS and a sandbox escape,"UPDATED A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the client application of Overwolf, the popular gaming development platform, has been patched.The critical flaw (CVE-2021-33501), which has a CVSS score of 9.6, stems from how Overwolf mishandled custom URLs used by Windows applications to “run a particular installed application when invoked”, according to a security advisory from SwordBytes Security.Unauthenticated attackers can achieve RCE on vulnerable clients by combining a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) bug with a Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) sandbox escape.Catch up on the latest gaming security newsOverwolf has been used by around 30,000 developers to create more than 90,000 extensions for games including Fortnite, Among Us, and World of Warcraft.Israeli parent company Overwolf Ltd recently announced a $52.5 million cash injection.Underlying issueCustom URL schemes are often used to navigate to a URL directly from the browser, which attackers can achieve “by redirecting valid users to a malicious link that abuses Overwolf’s custom URL handler ‘overwolfstore://’,” said Joel Noguera, SwordBytes founder and the researcher who discovered the RCE vulnerability.When the Overwolf client is launched, the CEF application proceeds to parse and analyze the provided URL to determine which UI should be rendered, Noguera said.Noguera, who is based in Argentina, said attackers had free rein to “craft different payloads that may produce unexpected results” because “there is no restriction on the values accepted by [the] application” during scheme parameters decoding.Reflected XSSRecounting the path to XSS, the researcher said that when the ‘SECTION’ portion of the URL – usually ‘overwolfstore://app/<SECTION>/<CATEGORY>/<EXTRAS>’ – is equal to ‘apps’”, the Overwolf Client generates a back-end request with the ‘CATEGORY’ value “in an attempt to obtain information about the extension being invoked”.The ‘UNEXPECTED_VALUE’ is reflected in the response body as part of an error message, and the Content-Type” is set to ‘text/html’, he continued.Reflected in the context of the Overwolf Store UI – “essentially a Chromium embedded browser (CEF)” – this response means “controlled content will be injected verbatim in the DOM”.The XSS was possible, concluded Noguera, because of a “lack of sanitization of the CATEGORY’s value” and the aforementioned back-end error message.Escaping the sandboxResearchers then used the Overwolf JavaScript API and the ‘overwolf-extensions://’ scheme to escape the CEF sandbox.“The main CEF process, ‘OverwolfBrowser.exe’, is running with the internal Overwolf flags enabled (--ow-enable-features and --ow-allow-internal), making it possible to call functions such as “overwolf.utils.openUrlInDefaultBrowser”, explained Noguera.And “if a value such as ‘calc.exe’ is provided, a call to ‘CreateProcess’ will be made, and the binary ‘calc.exe’ will be executed, allowing attackers to run arbitrary commands”.The researchers then leveraged ‘overwolf.io.writeFileContents’ to write a malicious batch file to ‘C:\windows\temp\’ that was executed via the ‘openUrlInDefaultBrowser’ method to achieve RCE.“One-click attacks usually require attackers to trick the victim into performing minimal interaction,” Noguera told The Daily Swig. “In this particular case, attackers would need to convince the user to accept that the Overwolf application is going to be launched.“It’s easy to assume that one simple click doesn’t represent a security risk, but sometimes that's not really the case. Once that action is allowed by the user, attacker would have control over the code being executed on their operative system.”Remediation timelineSwordBytes initiated contact with Overwolf Ltd on May 10, and the vendor released a hotfix addressing the issue on May 27. SwordBytes released the security advisory on May 31.The vulnerability is present in Overwolf Client 0.169.0.22, although the advisory notes that “prior versions might also be affected”.The latest Overwolf release, issued at the end of May, is version 0.170.“I want to highlight the great work Overwolf did by fixing the bug as soon as possible,” Noguera said. “Once they received the information, they quickly reacted and started to work on a hotfix to protect their users.”In response to an invitation to comment further, Overwolf simply told The Daily Swig that the fix requires no additional advice to users.This article was updated on June 1 with comment from both SwordBytes and OverwolfDON’T FORGET TO READ EPUB vulnerabilities: Electronic reading systems riddled with browser-like flaws",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/gaming-mod-development-platform-overwolf-fixes-bug-that-could-allow-rce-via-chained-exploit,"['Gaming', 'Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'XSS', 'Research', 'Browsers', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Israel', 'Middle', 'East', 'Argentina', 'Latin', 'America', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Industry', 'News', 'Windows']"
No,Bug Bounty Radar // The latest bug bounty programs for June 2021,New web targets for the discerning hacker,"Last month, we caught up with the three friends – Ron Chan, ‘FileDescriptor’, and ‘EdOverflow’ – behind the ethical hacking video channel Reconless.With around 8,000 subscribers, Reconless is inspired by Fireship’s application development-focused YouTube channel, and offers short explainers of a number of hacking topics, including soft skills such as writing engaging vulnerability reports.The trio described the vulnerabilities they are most proud of having uncovered.“My proudest discoveries were not security vulnerabilities that I uncovered but rather those where I aided someone else,” says EdOverflow. “I get more satisfaction out of knowing that someone was able to progress in this industry thanks to my small nudge.”In other industry news, popular hacking educator Katie Paxton-Fear had her YouTube channel taken down this month, without a strike warning, for 'severe' guideline violations.After the university lecturer and part-time bounty hunter was told that her channel contained 'harmful' content, she called for reviewers to be better informed about educational hacking content.“There’s a lot of people who upload actually harmful activity things like cyberstalking, hacking social media accounts, game hacking… and it can be hard for any system to differentiate between educational and non-educational content,” Paxton-Fear told The Daily Swig.“However, the strike system is supposed to handle this so your account isn’t removed.”The channel was swiftly reinstated following Paxton-Fear's appeal, and an outcry from the bug bounty and infosec community.In program news, the US Department of Defense has expanded its security vulnerability disclosure program to include all its publicly accessible information systems.That means it now covers all public-facing DoD networks, frequency-based communication platforms, IoT devices, and industrial control systems.“The department has always maintained the perspective that DoD websites were only the beginning as they account for a fraction of our overall attack surface,” said Kristopher Johnson, director of the DoD Cybercrime Center.Since its 2016 launch, says the DoD, the program has seen more than 29,000 security vulnerability reports, of which 70% were deemed valid.

no,EPUB vulnerabilities: Electronic reading systems riddled with browser-like flaws,Read on for page-turning pwnage,"Many electronic reading (e-reading) systems that support the open EPUB format have significant security vulnerabilities, new research shows.The EPUB format relies primarily on XHTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to construct e-books, with browser engines often used to render their contents. However, say according to a team of researchers, this gives e-book reading systems similar vulnerabilities to web browsers.According to a research paper (PDF) Gertjan Franken, Tom Van Goethem and Wouter Joosen of the imec-DistriNet Research Group, almost none of the JavaScript-supporting reading systems they looked at properly adhered to the EPUB specification’s security recommendations.Plot twistUsing a semi-automated testbed, available on GitHub, the researchers found that 16 of the 97 systems examined allowed an EPUB to leak information about the user’s file system, and in eight cases extract file contents. Attackers, they warn, could achieve a full compromise of a user’s system by exploiting specific aspects of the reading systems' implementation.""?Of course, the significance depends on the platform that is used; e-readers generally won't contain sensitive files, while smartphones could contain private pictures,"" Franken tells told The Daily Swig.Millions of users could potentially be affected.Check out the latest browser security news and analysisThe team also carried out a manual evaluation of the most popular EPUB reading applications on Amazon Kindle, Apple Books and the EPUBReader browser extension - and found a number of flaws.""For instance, the Amazon Kindle does not allow an EPUB to execute embedded JavaScript. Nevertheless, this can be circumvented by a creative attacker through an input validation issue,"" says Franken explained.""The embedded scripts could then exploit a publicly known vulnerability of the Kindle's outdated web engine to gain access to documents in the user's library.""Coordinated disclosureFlaws were also found in Apple Books, available pre-installed on macOS, and in the Windows version of Adobe Digital Editions.""Fortunately, the developers of Amazon, Apple and Adobe were very responsive to our bug reports and were eager to fix the issues,"" says Franken reports.The researchers argue that EPUB's security requirements should be tightened up, in particular by requiring specific users consent for JavaScript execution.RECOMMENDED Researchers discover fresh wave of ‘impersonation attack’ flaws in Bluetooth tech""Secondly, we argue that practical guidelines on how to handle the security and privacy aspects of developing a EPUB reading application would greatly aid developers,"" says Franken concluded.""Ideally, this would include guidelines on how to correctly configure popular browser engines, such that important security policies prevent an EPUB from gaining too much [many] privileges.""Franken added that the researchers have shared their findings with one of the editors of the EPUB standard, who acknowledged the issues.READ ON KindleDrip: Critical vulnerabilities in Amazon Kindle e-reader gave attackers free rein over user accounts",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/epub-vulnerabilities-electronic-reading-systems-riddled-with-browser-like-flaws,"['IoT', 'JavaScript', 'Browsers', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Industry', 'News', 'Amazon', 'Adobe', 'Apple', 'Retail', 'E-Commerce', 'RCE', 'Malware', 'Privacy', 'Data', 'Leak']"
no,Deadshot: Open source DevOps tool stops sensitive data from being uploaded to GitHub,Twilio security pros take aim at leaky commits,"Software code repositories could be harboring organizations’ credentials, secrets, and other sensitive data without developers’ knowledge – and this information could provide an invaluable resource for criminal hackers.This is according to security specialists at communications technology company Twilio, who have launched a free tool that warns developers when they accidentally include sensitive information in their code before it’s uploaded to a repository.Deadshot monitors GitHub pull requests in real time. The open source tool flags the potential inclusion of sensitive data in any code, as well as “changes to sensitive functionality”.According to Laxman Eppalagudem, a senior product security engineer at Twilio who worked on the project, no one can manually monitor an organization’s entire codebase. So, his team created an automated scanning tool to find and flag sensitive data.‘Deploy and forget’Deadshot is intended to work as a “deploy and forget” tool. As it runs in every commit, the tool should alert the project owners before any data leaves the organization.Security teams can specify what Deadshot monitors, and any alerts will be sent out via Slack or a Jira ticket.New releases: Check out more offensive and defensive web hacking tools“Twilio’s product security team identified a number of static secrets committed to the default branches of code repositories,” Yashvier Kosaraju, senior manager for product security at Twilio told The Daily Swig.“Having secrets in code is, of course, not a good security posture. We found that most published secrets came from unsuspecting developers that unknowingly committed them to GitHub.“We built Deadshot as a way to notify developers of secrets in their PRs [pull requests] and to help developers and their companies improve their security practices.”Leaky commitsThe accidental release of secrets and credentials to code repos is a significant problem, according to Kosaraju. He cites a GitGuardian report that identified over two million secrets in public GitHub repositories in 2020.“It’s intended to replace the need to manually review code pull requests for sensitive data commits, which we all know doesn’t scale,” he said.RELATED When vulnerability disclosure goes sour: New project details legal threats faced by ethical hackersDeadshot has been designed so it can only be installed on Github accounts by the organization’s administrators.This, Kosaraju said, reduces the danger of criminal hackers using Deadshot for illicit gains.“Scripts and bots doing this type of scanning over GitHub and other code repositories are already well-established on the offensive side,” security consultant James Bore told The Daily Swig.“It’s good to see it incorporated in a tool, as outside of ransomware these are the types of security failures I come across most option impacting companies, many times without their knowledge if the attacker is subtle.”GitHub already has security scanning capabilities, Blore noted. Developers could also use the open source tool Gittyleaks to scan for API keys, passwords and other sensitive data.Twilio is actively looking for feedback and feature requests from Deadshot users and the open source community, Kosaraju said.READ MORE Jenkins Attack Framework: New tool helps uncover vulnerabilities in CI/CD environments",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/deadshot-open-source-devops-tool-stops-sensitive-data-from-being-uploaded-to-github,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Passwords', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'GitHub', 'API', 'Authentication', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'IoT', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'OpSec', 'OSINT', 'Privacy', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak']"
no,Klarna privacy clanger blamed on buggy software update,Fintech firm rules out external attack,"E-commerce payment provider Klarna has apologized for a security incident on Thursday morning that resulted in users getting signed into other members’ accounts when they logged in.Users were able to see the name, associated postal address, purchases, and payment methods of other users because of the glitch. Partial banking details were also visible, according to early reports from Sweden.Some Klarna users on social media reported that every time they logged in they were confronted with a different, seemingly random, user’s details.Catch up on the latest e-commerce security newsIn response, Sweden-based Klarna temporarily suspended its app services while it dealt with the data leak issue. The problem was quickly traced to a bug introduced during an update to Klarna’s systems rather than any external breach.The fintech firm was able to resolve the issue by rolling back the faulty update before restoring services.In a statement, Klarna said the issue affected a total of 9,500 app users over the course of 31 minutes, adding that only app logins were affected by the issue. The fintech firm nonetheless promised to review its software release process, as a precaution.At 11:04 am CET this morning, we discovered that an update introduced 15 min earlier had led to an error affecting our app users. Our payment services, the Klarna Card, the merchant checkouts, and the merchant’s user interfaces, were completely unaffected by this. At 11.20.42 am CET the error was deemed to be contained and fixed.It is concluded that a human error caused the bug, and it was not an external breach of our systems. Despite following our set release process, we could still deploy a bug into our systems. This deems our release process to require reviewing and improvement to prevent errors like these in the future.Steven Hope, CEO and co-founder of Authlogics, said that Klarna’s privacy flap arose as the result of a self-inflicted bug.“This incident is more of a leak than a breach as Klarna weren’t targeted in this instance, it was more a self-inflicted bug due to human error,” Hope said. “The GDPR legislation lays out actions which must be taken depending on the classification of the data leaked, however timely disclosure is a key part which Klarna appear to have adhered to quite well.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/klarna-privacy-clanger-blamed-on-buggy-software-update,"['Data', 'Leak', 'Database', 'Security', 'E-Commerce', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Authentication', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Europe', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,"Threema, the European rival to Signal, wins pivotal privacy battle in Swiss Court",Supreme Court judges affirm lower court decision to uphold privacy of its nine million users,"Threema, the end-to-end-encrypted messaging service, has won a landmark court case in Switzerland’s highest court that means the Swiss company won’t be forced to betray its privacy-focused principles.Reaffirming a previous decision from a lower court, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ruled on April 29 that Threema should not be classified as a telecommunications service provider – only as a provider of ancillary communications services.Had the court overturned the original decision, Threema, which has more than nine million users, would have been legally obliged to collect and retain certain user data, in contravention with its privacy-oriented business model.If compelled, the company would also have to identify certain users and share their data with law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Timeline of a telco disputeThe case stems from a decision made by the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) in late 2018 that Threema should be designated as a telecoms service provider under the terms of the BÜPF (‘Federal Act on the Monitoring of Post and Telecommunications Traffic’).This would have seen the company legally classified as telco along with mainstream Swiss providers of mobile, broadband, and digital TV services like Swisscom or Sunrise.A complaint filed about the decision by Threema was granted a hearing by the Federal Administrative Court in mid-2020.Threema has nine million iOS and Android users worldwideExplaining the ruling, the Supreme Court judge intimated that if Threema were designated as a telecoms service provider, it would have necessitated applying the same legal definition to the vast majority of internet services, according to a Threema press release seen by The Daily Swig.Roman Flepp, head of sales and marketing for Threema, told The Daily Swig: “The attempt by the authorities to significantly expand their sphere of influence in order to gain access to even more user data has thus finally failed.“The fact that no precedent has been set at the expense of privacy is not only reassuring for internet users, but also gratifying for local online services, which otherwise would have been confronted with considerable additional administrative effort and major competitive disadvantages compared to foreign competitors.”Taking on Signal and TelegramFounded in 2012, Threema provides instant messaging, audio and video calls, and a file transmission capability for more than nine million iOS and Android users, 80% of whom are based in Germany, Switzerland, or Austria.“Our user base continues to grow and [grow] even faster in recent months, also due to the ongoing discussion about WhatsApp’s new privacy policies,” said Flepp, who The Daily Swig interviewed back in 2018. “More and more people are concerned and are looking for a privacy-friendly and secure chat solution like Threema.”Unlike Facebook-owned market leader WhatsApp, the mobile app manages contact lists and user profiles on the device rather than a server, deletes chat messages from its servers upon delivery, does not request access to a device’s address book, and verifies contacts with QR codes.Catch up on the latest data privacy news and breachesThe service can also be used anonymously without providing an email address or phone number – unlike fellow privacy-focused rivals Telegram and Signal.Threema runs its own servers in Switzerland, home to privacy-focused email service Protonmail, from a base in a country seen as an exemplar for privacy regulations.Unlike its free to download and use rivals, however, it charges a one-time fee of €3.99 in the EU and $2.99 in the US to download.Long-running battleThe Threema ruling is the latest milestone in a long-running battle between privacy-advocating tech firms and law enforcement agencies seeking the ability to decrypt the encrypted communications of suspected criminals.The US is among a number of countries considering laws that would compel tech companies to grant law enforcement back-door access to suspects’ devices, while Apple resists periodic calls from the FBI to unlock criminal suspects’ iPhones.Whether for criminals, journalists, political activists or individuals living under despotic regimes, end-to-end encryption remains a powerful defense against government snooping.In December 2020, Israel-based digital forensics firm Cellebrite claimed to have found a way to decrypt Signal messages – but crucially this approached relied on gaining physical access to the device, not by remotely decrypting intercepted messages.Update, June 1: Switzerland’s Supreme Court has now published its decision on the Threema case (in German). YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Raising the bar: Tiki app aims to hand ownership of personal data back to the

no,Argument injection vulnerability in image handling library affects content management systems,Risk posed by Ruby Gem Dragonfly flaws is unarguable,"Security researchers have traced an argument injection vulnerability in content management systems (CMS) to flaws in Ruby Gem Dragonfly, an image handling library.New Zealand security consultancy ZX Security uncovered the problem after encountering issues in configurations of Refinery CMS while carrying out security assessments for a client.The researchers subsequently discovered that other content management systems that rely on the same vulnerable Dragonfly library – including Locomotive CMS and Alchemy CMS – were also at risk.The flaw allowed exploits including arbitrary file read, arbitrary file write, and (given favourable conditions) remote code execution.A technical write up by ZX Security explains the issue in more detail.Catch up on the latest secure software development newsThe Daily Swig submitted a number of follow-up questions to ZX Security.

No,"Canada Post reveals supplier data breach involving shipping information of 950,000 parcel recipients",Names and postal addresses leak blamed on malware attack,"A cyber-attack on a third-party supplier of Canada Post has resulted in a data breach impacting 950,000 parcel recipients, the state-owned postal service has announced.In a press release published yesterday (May 26), Canada Post said it had informed 44 “large business customers” that they had potentially been affected by “a malware attack” against Commport Communications, a provider of electronic data interchange (EDI) services.The supplier notified Canada Post a week earlier, on May 19, “that manifest data held in their systems, which was associated with some Canada Post customers, had been compromised”.Catch up on the latest cybersecurity news from CanadaThe exposed data, said Canada Post, involves the names and postal addresses of parcel recipients in 97% of cases, with the other 3% comprising an email address and/or phone number.The shipping information for “just over” 950,000 parcel recipients relates to a nearly three-year period between July 2016 and March 2019.The ongoing investigation has found “no evidence that any financial information was breached”, added Canada Post.Canada Post, the country’s largest postal operator, uses Commport Communications’ EDI services to manage shipping manifest data, which includes sender and receiver contact information required for shipping labels, in order to fulfil parcel orders for its business customers.‘Potential ransomware issue’Canada Post also referenced “a potential ransomware issue” flagged by Commport Communications to its IT subsidiary, Innovapost, in November 2020. However, this “was investigated with Commport Communications advising there was no evidence to suggest any customer data had been compromised at that time”.Canada Post said it had notified the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and is “proactively informing the impacted business customers and providing the information and support necessary to help them determine their next steps”.The postal operator added that it had “already implemented proactive measures and will continue to take all necessary steps to mitigate the impacts.“Canada Post will also incorporate any learnings into our efforts, including the involvement of suppliers, to enhance our cyber security approach.”The Daily Swig has contacted Canada Post and Commport Communications with some additional queries.

no,"Bluetooth pairing, pwned: Security researchers discover fresh wave of ‘impersonation attack’ flaws in wireless tech",Inherent weaknesses in short-range radio technology laid bare,"Attackers were able to impersonate legitimate devices during the Bluetooth pairing process because of inherent security weaknesses in the Bluetooth Core and Bluetooth Mesh specifications that underpin the ubiquitous wireless technology.Researchers at ANSSI – the French equivalent of the UK’s GCHQ – uncovered flaws in each specification that allow device impersonation and AuthValue disclosures.A total of six vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-26555 through CVE-2020-26560) were uncovered by the research.The vulnerabilities are featured in a paper, ‘BlueMirror: Reflections on the Bluetooth Pairing and Provisioning Protocols’, that’s due to be presented by ANSSI researchers Tristan Claverie and José Lopes Esteves at the WOOT conference tomorrow (May 27).BIAS: Bluetooth Impersonation AttacksThe clutch of vulnerabilities discovered by ANSSI builds on prior research into so-called ‘Bluetooth Impersonation Attacks’ (BIAS), which was revealed by academics last year.As with the 2020 paper (PDF), this latest batch of flaws is of particular significance because they each relate to core Bluetooth specifications and not simply a poor implementation of the technology.As outlined in the BlueMirror research, unpatched devices supporting the Bluetooth Core Specification are affected by the following vulnerabilities: impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol (CVE-2020-26558); impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol (CVE-2020-26555); and impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning (CVE-2020-26560).In addition, predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning opens the door to potential manipulator-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, a vulnerability tracked as CVE-2020-26557.Catch up on the latest mobile security newsAnother flaw means the Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker to identify the AuthValue directly without brute-forcing its value (CVE-2020-26559).On top of this, the authentication protocol is vulnerable if the AuthValue can be identified during the provisioning procedure, even if the AuthValue is selected randomly (CVE-2020-26556).Lastly, the researchers also identified a potential security vulnerability involving LE Legacy Pairing authentication in Bluetooth Core Specification versions 4.0 through 5.2.The flaw means an “attacker can reflect the confirmation and random numbers of a peer device in LE legacy pairing to successfully complete legacy authentication phase two without knowledge of the temporary key”.Upstream patchesFortunately, the Bluetooth Core and Bluetooth Mesh BIAS vulnerabilities were responsibly disclosed some months ago, and protections are already largely in place.However, Bluetooth users should “ensure that they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers”, according to an advisory from the US-CERT Coordination Center.The advisory offers a rundown of which wireless and other technology providers are affected by the Bluetooth flaws.Myriad threatsNeil Peacock, joint founder of Blok Cyber Security, told The Daily Swig that tricking targets into pairing with an attacker-controlled device is one of several ways that Bluetooth can be hacked.“Bluetooth attacks have been around for years, ever since it launched,” according to Peacock. “The Cabir worm was the first known wireless worm that could transmit itself to mobile phones. Since Cabir, threats to Bluetooth have become more sophisticated.”Peacock said Bluetooth devices can also be hacked by pairing with them without the owner’s knowledge and accessing personal data, and tricking victims into pairing with an unknown device whose name typosquats on the name of a device they trust (thus giving hackers access to the entire device). Other threats include hacked headsets that allow malicious people to listen to your conversations, and, similarly, Bluebugging, where attackers remotely access a user’s phone.“The cybersecurity threat to Bluetooth should not be underestimated and we should all take steps to protect ourselves before hackers steal confidential information,” Peacock concluded, adding that the threat level is such that Bluetooth should be switched off when not in use.RECOMMENDED Open source ecosystem ripe for dependency confusion attacks, research finds",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/bluetooth-pairing-pwned-security-researchers-discover-fresh-wave-of-impersonation-attack-flaws-in-wireless-tech,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Mobile', 'MitM', 'Authentication', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'Passwords', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'France', 'Europe', 'Research', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Encryption', 'Pen', 'Testing']"
no,Overlooked vulnerabilities in GraphQL open the door to cross-site request forgery attacks,"CSRF risk factors are often hidden, and misunderstood, in GraphQL implementations","Endpoints using GraphQL may be at risk of exploitation due to failures to mitigate cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack vectors, researchers warn.On May 20, Doyensec researchers Tomasz Swiadek and Andrea Brancaleoni said that an examination of enterprise endpoints using GraphQL revealed that configuration issues in implementations might be exposing systems to unnecessary risks.GraphQL is an open source query language for APIs. The developer tool has been designed to streamline queries by using data decoupling from a database via graphs, together with one endpoint, rather than pulling data from multiple sources.CSRF is a class of attack caused by malicious web applications that force web browsers to perform actions on behalf of a user without their consent – as well as circumvent ‘same origin’ policies. This could include changing the settings of an online service account, changing passwords, or transferring funds.Multiple vulnerabilitiesAccording to Swiadek and Brancaleoni, there are two forms of GraphQL CSRF at hand that developers should be aware of.The first is a POST-based CSRF. GraphQL endpoints usually accept Content-Type headers when they are set to application/json only, but when ‘middleware’ translates requests from other formats – such as query parameters, application/x-www-form-urlencoded, or multipart/form-data – and no CSRF protections are in place, this can provide an avenue for exploitation.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Opera security team discloses multiple flaws in open source web proxy, Privoxy“GraphQL implementations are often affected by CSRF,” the researchers say. “Another incorrect assumption is that JSON cannot be created from urlencoded requests. The false sense of security works in the attacker’s favor, since it creates an attack surface which is easier to exploit.”For example, a CSRF could be triggered, under the right conditions, if a valid GraphQL query is sent via POST and converted in Burp.The other vulnerability of note is the possibility of GET-based CSRFs.There are two common issues the cybersecurity firm has encountered which could be exploited to trigger this form of attack, the first being the accidental exposure of GraphiQL consoles, which are only intended for developer environments.GraphiQL permits mutations in GET requests, so if exploited, the researchers say it can be abused to perform CSRF by forcing browsers to “issue arbitrary query or mutation requests”.The second issue is also down to misconfiguration – namely, when state-changing GraphQL operations are misplaced in queries which are normally non-state changing.Catch up on the latest secure software development newsSwiadek and Brancaleoni also say that in some cases, developers will choose to bypass available CSRF protections entirely, and this oversight can also create a wider attack surface.Testing the attacksDuring a limited, two-day test of “top” companies that utilize GraphQL and roughly 30 endpoints belonging to them, the duo discovered what they called an “impressive amount of unpatched vulnerabilities”.In total, 14 were vulnerable to an XS-Search attack (GET-based CSRF), and three were vulnerable to some form of CSRF.In XS-Search attacks leveraging a CSRF, in which a victim is forced to send a data request, response times measurements could also create additional data leaks – such as whether or not a specific file exists.“The implications of a successful XS-Search attack on a GraphQL endpoint cannot be overstated,” the researchers note. “However, as previously mentioned, CSRF-based issues can be successfully mitigated with some effort.”The Daily Swig has reached out to the GraphQL Foundation with additional queries and we will update when we hear back.DON’T FORGET TO READ Nagios IT monitoring vulnerabilities chained to compromise telco customers en masse",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/overlooked-vulnerabilities-in-graphql-open-the-door-to-cross-site-request-forgery-attacks,"['CSRF', 'XS-Leak', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Browsers', 'Research', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Passwords', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"

no,Nagios IT monitoring vulnerabilities chained to compromise telco customers en masse,Medium-impact flaws combined to create ‘upstream attack platform’,"UPDATED Security researchers have detailed how a series of moderate severity vulnerabilities in IT monitoring technology Nagios could be chained together to attack organizations on a grand scale.Researchers at Australian security consultancy Skylight discovered a total of 13 security flaws in Nagios, a widely used open source IT monitoring tool comparable to SolarWinds.The flaws in Nagios XI and Nagios Fusion servers were reported to the vendor, who addressed all 13 vulnerabilities last October.Check your monitorThe Nagios vulnerabilities discovered by Skylight involve a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw, a series of privilege escalation flaw, an information disclosure bug, and an authenticated remote code execution issue.Skylight acknowledges the requirement for an attacker to be authenticated in a technical write-up that describes the flaws as a “few lame(ish) vulnerabilities in Nagios”.RECOMMENDED Open source ecosystem ripe for dependency confusion attacks, research findsHowever, dismissing the flaws as inconsequential would be a mistake because the researchers were able to chain together a selection of these vulnerabilities to attack the monitoring infrastructure of a telco or other service provider (providing they are able to first break into the Nagios-related systems of one of its users).Chain gangSolarWinds’ update mechanism was compromised to carry out a high-profile hack against US government agencies and others last year, so flaws in any similar technology, such as Nagios, merit increased scrutiny.Skylight’s Adi Ashkenazy told The Daily Swig: “When chaining together five of the vulnerabilities, an attacker can [compromise] the entire monitoring infrastructure without any operator intervention.”“In a telco setting, where a telco is monitoring thousands of sites, if a customer’s site is fully compromised, an attacker can use the vulnerabilities to compromise the telco, and then every other monitored customer site,” Ashkenazy added.Catch up on the latest security research newsSkylight has developed a post-exploitation tool called SoyGun that chains the vulnerabilities and automates the process of breaking into vulnerable Nagios systems.The tool was released to the penetration testing community as an open source project.The Daily Swig is yet to receive a response to a request for comment from Nagios.Skylight’s Ashkenazy told The Daily Swig that its research into Nagios offered wider lessons for other software developers""This is a good example of the fallacy of 'low risk' security issues,"" Ashkenazy said. ""If you have a collection of low to medium risk vulnerabilities, those may be chained together to create a critical impact. If you only looked at the security/patch notes from Nagios, you would have no idea that something like this is possible combining several of the vulnerabilities"".The research further illustrated that ""vetting and testing of third parties from a security perspective is completely broken"", according to Ashkenazy.Ashkenazy explained: ""Nagios would pass any procurement and vendor test, and still the amount of effort required to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities was very low. It would be a complete no-brainer for sophisticated nation-state attackers who are targeting these type of software components.""We need to rethink how we test and the controls we put around 3rd party tools in our IT environments,"" Ashkenazy concluded.This story was updated to add comment from Skylight’s Adi AshkenazyREAD MORE Critical vulnerabilities patched in QNAP Music Station, Malware Remover apps",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nagios-it-monitoring-vulnerabilities-chained-to-compromise-telco-customers-en-masse,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Australia', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'XSS', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Telecommunications', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Oceania', 'RCE', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Surveillance', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Network', 'Security', 'Authentication']"
no,"Open source ecosystem ripe for dependency confusion attacks, research finds",Attacks could put ‘millions of users’ at risk,"UPDATED The most popular open source repositories are rife with misconfigurations that leave countless downstream applications at risk from dependency confusion attacks, security researchers have discovered.Of the 1,000 organizations whose GitHub accounts were analyzed based on their star rating and activity levels, more than one in five – 212 – contained at least one dependency confusion-related misconfiguration in their codebase.“If any of their projects get affected, there’s a high probability that millions of users will be at risk,” said Somdev Sangwan, security researcher at RedHunt Labs, in a blog post.Spate of attacksDependency confusion attacks infiltrate the open source ecosystem with malicious components by overriding privately-used dependency packages with malicious, public packages with the exact same name.BACKGROUND Researcher hacks Apple, Microsoft, and other major tech companies in novel supply chain attackThere has been a spate of these supply chain attacks since the technique’s architect, security researcher Alex Birsan, revealed in February that he had successfully compromised ecosystems maintained by Apple, Microsoft, and PayPal with ‘dummy’ packages.Only a week later, suspicious packages bearing the name of legitimate libraries were found in the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository, and soon after PyPI and NPM Registry maintainers removed thousands of malicious packages smuggled into repositories using the same ‘substitution’ technique.Ripe for hijackingOf 38,691 individual repositories scanned by RedHunt Labs, 20,220 contained files used to store dependencies.Defying the researchers’ expectations, the most common issue surfaced among these were packages with ‘unreachable’, and therefore hijackable, sources. This comprised 169 repositories that had installed packages from expired domains, and 126 that contained packages owned by non-existent GitHub or GitLab profiles.The researchers also found numerous instances of publicly unavailable packages, meaning they had been deleted or mistyped, or were private packages that could be registered publicly.Almost 10% of organizations (93) were using at least one package that didn’t exist on a public package index, the researchers found.Flip the ScriptJavaScript packages tend to have the most dependencies, with 12,212 of 17,496 JavaScript repositories containing the telltale package.json files used by JavaScript package managers NPM and Yarn.JavaScript dependencies are also, along with those connected to Golang, most likely to be from unreachable sources.JavaScript repos collectively contained 345 such packages, along with 72 publicly unavailable packages.Catch up on the latest software supply chain attack newsThe corresponding numbers for the 4,198 Golang/Go repos, 2,052 of which used a go.mod dependency management file, were 69 from unreachable sources and zero from unavailable packages.Of 8,614 Python repositories, only 2,906 appeared to used dependencies, which contained 40 unavailable packages and seven from unreachable sources.Ruby repos didn’t contain a single unavailable package and used just seven packages from sources that were not publicly reachable, despite having a significant number of dependencies. Of 4,538 Ruby repositories, 3,044 used a dependency storage ‘Gemfile’.Of 33 PHP repositories with the equivalent composer.json file, one had an unavailable package and two were from unreachable sources.Exploiting the trust model“It was surprising to see how such large organizations that are very security conscious could have also been affected by simply exploiting the trust model (supply chain),” Somdev Sangwan of RedHunt Labs told The Daily Swig.“Some dependencies managers have responded responsibly by patching the problematic components. However, it’s up to end-users to implement them securely, as humans are the weakest link after all.“While the industry has already learnt about these attacks, it still keeps coming back in various forms,” continued the researcher.“Python’s mismatch of PyPI and import names is such an example. It is not inherently a bug on Python’s end but simply a common human error.“Having said that, it’s time to reassess our trust in resources maintained by third parties.”DON’T FORGET TO READ Researchers find denial-of-service equivalent against machine learning systemsMajor software vendors have been scrambling to contribute to a defense-in-depth response to the dependency confusion threat in the wake of Alex Birsan’s research.In February, Google set out proposals for creating “well-defined, verifiable official versions” of ‘critical’ software, which received pushback and prompted alternative, supposedly lower-friction suggestions such as fine-grained sandboxing and a dependency tagging system from Firefox CTO Eric Rescorla.Sonatype, meanwhile, launched a ‘dependency/namespace confusion checker’ tool that detects the signatures of dependency confusion attacks.Microsoft (PDF) and GitHub have also both, along with RedHunt Labs themselves, set out ways to mitigate the threat.The Daily Swig has also contacted GitHub and the NPM Registry for further comment.

no,DeepSloth: Researchers find denial-of-service equivalent against machine learning systems,DoS-style attacks can slow deep neural networks to a crawl,"A new adversarial attack developed by scientists at the University of Maryland, College Park, can force machine learning systems to slow to a crawl, taxing servers and possibly causing critical failures in some applications.Presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), the technique neutralizes optimization techniques that speed up the operation of deep neural networks.Multi-exit architecturesDeep neural networks, a popular type of machine learning algorithm, sometimes require gigabytes of memory and very strong processors, making them inaccessible to resource-constrained IoT devices, smartphones, and wearables.Many of these devices must send their data to a cloud server that can run deep learning models.To overcome these challenges, researchers have invented different techniques to optimize neural networks for small devices.RELATED Machine learning security vulnerabilities are a growing threat to the web, report highlightsSo-called ‘multi-exit architectures’, one optimization technique, causes neural networks to stop computation as soon as they reach an acceptable threshold.“Early-exit models are a relatively new concept, but there is a growing interest,” Tudor Dumitras, researcher at the University of Maryland, told The Daily Swig.“This is because deep learning models are getting more and more expensive, computationally, and researchers look for ways to make them more efficient.”DeepSloth attacksDumitras and his collaborators developed a slowdown adversarial attack that targets the efficacy of multi-exit neural networks. Called DeepSloth, the attack makes subtle changes to input data to prevent neural networks from making early exits and force them to perform full computations.“Slowdown attacks have the potential of negating the benefits of multi-exit architectures,” Dumitras said. “These architectures can half the energy consumption of a DNN model at inference time, and we showed that for any input we can craft a perturbation that wipes out those savings completely.”The researchers tested DeepSloth on various multi-exit architectures. In cases where attackers had full knowledge of the architecture of the target model, slowdown attacks reduced early-exit efficacy by 90-100%.Read more of the latest AI security newsEven when the attacker doesn’t have exact information about the target model, DeepSloth still reduced efficacy by 5-45%.This is the equivalent of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on neural networks. When models are served directly from a server, DeepSloth can occupy the server’s resources and prevent it from using its full capacity.In cases where a multi-exit network is split between an edge device and the cloud, it could force the device to send all its data to the server, which can cause harm in different ways.“In a scenario typical for IoT deployments, where the model is partitioned between edge devices and the cloud, DeepSloth amplifies the latency by 1.5-5X, negating the benefits of model partitioning,” Dumitras said.This could cause the edge device to miss critical deadlines, for instance in an elderly monitoring program that uses AI to quickly detect accidents and call for help if necessary.”New directions for security researchThe researchers found that adversarial training, the standard of protecting machine learning models against adversarial attacks, is not effective against DeepSloth attacks.“I want to bring this threat model to the attention of the machine learning community,” Dumitras said. “DeepSloth is just the first attack that works in this threat model, and I am sure that more devastating slowdown attacks will be discovered.”In the future, Dumitras and his colleagues will further explore vulnerabilities in early-exit models and develop methods to make them more secure and robust.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/deepsloth-researchers-find-denial-of-service-equivalent-against-machine-learning-systems,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'AI', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'IoT', 'Research', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service']"

Half the $200,000 payment will be given up front with the remainder suspended.Filters Fast became one of the growing list of online companies to suffer from a Magecart-style credit card skimmer attack as the result of a breach that lasted between July 2019 and July 2020, when the problem was finally identified. The breach provoked the lawsuit from the Attorney General of New York (NYAG) after some 324,000 US citizens were affected.The as yet unknown attackers exploited a known vulnerability in a plugin for vBulletin on the Filters Fast web forum to gain initial compromise through a SQL injection attack, according to testimony (PDF) by investigators working for the NYAG.Catch up on the latest data breach newsAccording to a statement on the settlement, attackers collected sensitive customer information after compromising Filters Fast’s online checkout process. Harvested information included credit card holders’ names, billing addresses, expiration dates, and security codes.Filters Fast had the opportunity to resolve the breach months before it was finally confirmed.On February 25, 2020, a credit card payment system management company notified Filters Fast of links between purchases to its site and subsequent fraudulent transactions.An internal investigation by Filters Fast at the time wrongly concluded there was no breach. It was only when further similar fraud pattern results came in May that an external forensics investigator was hired who belatedly confirmed the breach, and identified its cause as being a missed software patch.The critical software update – available for three years prior – was only applied on July 10, 2020, at which point attackers were finally locked out of the system.It was only in August 2020 – more than a year after the initial compromise of its systems and some six months after the first “common point of purchase notification” – that Filters Fast began notifying affected customers, who were offered apologies and 12 months identity protection services.The Daily Swig contacted Filters Fast to comment on the settlement with New York state.No word back as yet but we’ll update this story as and when more information comes to hand.RELATED Magecart Group 12 unleashes stealthy PHP skimmer against vulnerable Magento e-commerce sites",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/us-water-filter-supplier-pays-200-000-to-settle-credit-card-data-leak-lawsuit,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Magecart', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'US', 'E-Commerce', 'Legal', 'Data', 'Leak', 'North', 'America', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation']"

Malware Remover is an antivirus app ecosystem designed to protect QNAP NAS products.Catch up on the latest cybersecurity research newsIn a security advisory dated May 19, researchers at Italian security consultancy Shielder disclosed two vulnerabilities that could be chained to perform “pre-auth remote root command execution” if exploited by attackers.The first vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-36197 and issued a CVSS severity score of 7.1, is an improper access control and arbitrary write security flaw in Music Station. The researchers found that the software’s album cover art upload function (arttype), musicstation/api/upload.php, did not stop the transfer of crafted, malicious files.Upon parsing the arttype request parameter, the file is run on the root level in the QTS file system.Music Station versions prior to 5.3.16 (QTS 4.5.2), before 5.2.10 (QTS 4.3.6) 5.1.14 and below (QTS 4.3.3), versions prior to 5.3.16 (QuTS h4.5.2), and versions 5.3.16 and below (QuTScloud c4.5.4) are all impacted.Strike twoThe second vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-36198, is a command injection bug which could allow attackers to run arbitrary commands by abusing an automatic scan mechanism.The default app contains 19 modules that are mainly in pyc format, and one of these functions, modules/02_autoupgrade.pyc, is vulnerable to command injection and an arbitrary file write in an arbitrary file path -- both of which can be abused to obtain RCE as root.Malware Remover versions prior to 4.6.1.0 are affected.“By chaining both issues it’s possible to gain pre-auth remote code execution with root privileges on a remote QNAP NAS,” Shielder says.The critical vulnerabilities were reported through Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and the vendor was made aware of the researchers’ findings in January 2021.

In fact, I would almost go as far as to say try to determine what makes unsuccessful hackers unsuccessful.EdOverflow: In my opinion, hacking is a philomathic endeavor and therefore enjoying the process of learning plays an important part in this industry.Which security vulnerability are you most proud of discovering and why? And was this reflected in the payout you received?Ron Chan: A remote code execution vulnerability that could be triggered via a GET-based CSRF flaw. It is my biggest single payout to date.I discovered this flaw through source code review. I am proud of this finding because I learnt how to review source code to find security flaws after joining GitLab.Filedescriptor: A race condition in OAuth. It involved a lot of testing to confirm it was indeed vulnerable and I spent quite some time making the attack feasible. I was awarded the maximum bounty.EdOverflow: My proudest discoveries were not security vulnerabilities that I uncovered but rather those where I aided someone else.

no,Former US soccer stadium hot dog concession manager jailed over computer sabotage,Earthquakes shaken by hack that relied on unrevoked admin credentials,"A former manager at a San Francisco soccer stadium has been jailed for 20 months after he admitted deleting computer data by sabotaging its food and drink concession system.Salvatore A. La Rosa, 41, of San Jose, California, was further ordered to pay $268,733 in restitution as well as a $5,000 fine for intentional damage to a protected computer.Denial of serviceThe case dates back to February 2020 and the first home game of the San Jose Earthquakes 2020 MLS season.Point-of-sale tablets used by Spectra Food Services and Hospitality staff at the stadium stopped working, leaving staff unable to accept credit cards. Spectra’s employees were forced to resort to handwriting orders and using calculators to complete cash transactions.Catch up on the latest cybercrime newsAll this caused delays, lost orders, and angry sports fans. In addition to the cost of restoring its system, Spectra was left further out of pocket because it had to offer food at no cost on the day as well as later offering a cut price promotion at its next home game in order to win back the loyalty of aggrieved punters.The disruption was subsequently traced back to La Rosa, who worked as an operations and premium services manager for Spectra for five years prior to the termination of his employment in January 2020, one month prior to chaos in the concession stalls at the Earthquakes Stadium.Unrevoked credentialsLa Rosa’s admin credentials were not revoked after he left his employment, an oversight that allowed him to log into an online administration panel and delete Spectra’s concessions menu and payment selections.According to a plea agreement, La Rosa used these credentials to log into the system and delete functions using his home PC, so it isn’t terribly surprising that investigators quickly identified La Rosa as a suspect.The 41-year-old was arrested and charged in October 2020 with a single count of damage to a protected computer. He admitted this cybercrime offence by pleading guilty in February 2021.READ MORE Packaging vendor Ardagh admits cyber-attack disrupted operations",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/former-us-soccer-stadium-hot-dog-concession-manager-jailed-over-computer-sabotage,"['Cybercrime', 'Database', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Network', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'E-Commerce', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Legal', 'Retail']"
no,SolarWinds hack: Nation-state attackers could have launched supply chain attack nine months earlier than previously thought,Company CEO sheds light on high-profile breach at RSA Conference 2021,"The nation-state attackers behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack could have gained access to the company nine months before it has been previously reported.This is according to the CEO of the company, who last night (May 19) shed light on what happened in the run up to the high-profile attack.Headlines were dominated earlier this year by the news that a backdoor in software updates distributed by the IT management and monitoring platform had been used to gain access to SolarWinds’ clients.The vulnerabilities in its Orion software enabled attackers to compromise the accounts of customers including Microsoft, many US government agencies, and cybersecurity firm FireEye.Speaking during a fireside chat at the RSA Conference 2021, SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna said that new evidence suggests the malicious actors first targeted the software as early as January 2019.Early accessOfficial statements have until now stated that the attackers gained access to SolarWinds’ systems in September 2019 at the earliest, however Ramakrishna explained that there was evidence of “early recon activities” as far back as the start of that year.“What we have found recently is that attackers may have been in our environment as early as January 2019,” Ramakrishna told Laura Koetzle, vice president and group director at Forrester Research, during the chat.Ramakrishna, who took over the post in January 2021, said he was first made aware of the backdoor in December 2020, a month before he joined the company.BACKGROUND Multiple new flaws uncovered in SolarWinds software just weeks after high-profile supply chain attackFireEye, the first to publicly report the attack, said that threat actors accessed Orion users’ networks via a trojan injected into software updates.The unknown actors, who evaded detection from both SolarWinds and its clients for months, were able to steal files and data from victims, including source code taken from Microsoft.Ramakrishna described the attacks as “extremely well done and extremely sophisticated, where they did everything possible to hide in plain sight”.“We were looking for all the usual clues,” the CEO added. “When you go through an investigation, you have a checklist, you have a set of hypotheses, you try to map things.“And in this particular case, given the amount of time they spent, and given the deliberateness they had in their efforts, they were able to cover their fingerprints, cover their tracks, at every step of the way.”READ Who is behind APT29? What we know about this nation-state cybercrime groupRamakrishna said that the incident was made more difficult “given the resources of a nation state” – in this case, the attack is blamed on APT29 – or ‘Cozy Bear’ – a group linked by threat intel experts to Russia’s foreign intelligence service (SVR).SolarWinds was eventually able to pinpoint exactly what the attackers achieved by assessing hundreds of terabytes of data and thousands of build systems.Laura Koetzle interviews SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna about the high-profile attack‘All hands on deck’Ramakrishna explained that there was a security incident response team in place even before the exploitation of the backdoor, but that the incident “escalated the significance” of that team and required the company to take an “all hands on deck” approach.This required even the CEO to speaking to customers and find out their concerns, which Ramakrishna said was mainly how it would affect them.“What started off as a reactive measure, we [then] started learning about the incident, we started addressing issues, and one of the foundations of what we’ve been trying to do is transparency as we enhance the trust that we have with our customers.“Specifically, we also worked with our worldwide partners and created a program called the Orion Assistant Program.”The idea behind the free-of-extra-cost program, which is funded by SolarWinds, is to provide extra assistance to some customers who may not have the resources to upgrade easily, due to issues such as financial constraints or technical knowledge.READ MORE Microsoft downplays threat after admitting SolarWinds attackers accessed source codeWhen asked, in hindsight, what he would have done differently, Ramakrishna answered with “having a stronger media response”.“SolarWinds has historically kept to itself, focusing on customers, focusing on itself internally, and it was never trying to grab attention.“In this particular case, the attention was thrust upon us. And if I thought about one area that we were not fully prepared… we were not prepared [for the media response].”Looking back, Ramakrishna said he wished he had “more resources, more proactive outreach”, an issue he says the company has learned from by expanding its communication team, so that SolarWinds can be prepared for other instances and can help others.“Although I do not wish something like this to happen to anyone in the industry,” he concluded.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Beyond Lazarus: North Korean cyber-threat groups become top-tier, ‘reckless’ adversaries",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/solarwinds-hack-nation-state-attackers-could-have-launched-supply-chain-attack-nine-months-earlier-than-previously-thought,"['Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Russia', 'US', 'Microsoft', 'Network', 'Security', 'North', 'America', 'Asia', 'Cybercrime', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Malware', 'Events', 'DevSecOps', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,"WordPress security: More than 600,000 sites hit by blind SQLi vulnerability in WP Statistics plugin",Sensitive database data at risk if webmasters fail to update systems,"UPDATED WP Statistics, a popular web analytics plugin for WordPress, contained a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability that, if exploited, could result in sensitive information being exfiltrated from a site’s database.Webmasters of WordPress sites running the open source plugin, which number more than 600,000, have been urged to update their systems as soon as possible.The nature of the high severity (CVSS score 7.5) pre-authenticated vulnerability (CVE-2021-24340) means “exfiltrating information would be a relatively slow process, and it would be impractical to use it to extract bulk records”, said Ram Gall, threat analyst and QA engineer at WordPress security platform Wordfence, in a blog post published on Tuesday (May 18).Catch up on the latest WordPress security newsNevertheless, “high-value information such as user emails, password hashes, and encryption keys and salts could be extracted in a matter of hours with the help of automated tools such as sqlmap.In a targeted attack, this vulnerability could be used to extract personally identifiable information from e-commerce sites containing customer information.“This underscores the importance of having security protections with an endpoint firewall in place wherever sensitive data is stored.”Constructing the attackAmong other traffic data, WP Statistics provides detailed figures about which pages website users visit.Accessing a ‘Pages’ menu generates an SQL query that displays these statistics, said Gall.RECOMMENDED Opera security team discloses multiple flaws in open source web proxy, PrivoxyAlthough the function is supposed to be restricted to administrators, “it was possible to start loading this page’s constructor by sending a request to wp-admin/admin.php with the page parameter set to wps_pages_page”, continued the threat analyst.“Since the SQL query ran in the Page constructor,” any visitor could trigger the SQL query without logging in. “A malicious actor could then supply malicious values for the ID or type parameters.”No esc_apeAs with another time-based blind SQL injection bug Wordfence recently discovered in CleanTalk’s AntiSpam plugin, the use of an esc_sql function failed to repel the attack for want of a prepared statement, said Gall.Elaborating on the issue, the threat analyst told The Daily Swig: “We’ve seen multiple instances in the past where escaping input was insufficient and led to a false sense of security, and expect to see more in the future. Escaping input can be sufficient in some cases, but it’s not really a safe assumption anymore.He added: “Prepared statements have been considered a best practice for a long time now, and while some developers may have avoided them in the past because they can be tricky to implement manually, there’s not really an excuse for not using them in WordPress thanks to the ease of use that $wpdb->prepare() allows.”However, Mostafa Soufi, co-founder of WP Statistics developer VeronaLabs, told The Daily Swig that the flaw was less serious than Wordfence researchers indicated, because “they didn't provide us an example to [prove] there [was] a security bug on the query,” and “those parameters [were] already sanitized with esc_sql() one by one before the patch”.Wordfence has since responded to these assertions with the following statement: “A sample PoC was sent to VeronaLabs upon discovery of the vulnerability to demonstrate how an exploit of the coding flaw was possible.“Additionally, another security researcher has published a proof of concept based on the minimally detailed article published on Wordfence.com. In other words, this has already been reproduced by other security researchers.”The Wordfence threat intelligence team alerted VeronaLabs to the vulnerability on March 13, and a release containing a fix, version 13.0.8, was issued on March 25.The vulnerability affects all previous versions.This article was updated on May 25 with additional comments from Mostafa Soufi of VeronaLabs, and then with a response to those comments from Wordfence on May 26.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/wordpress-security-more-than-600-000-sites-hit-by-blind-sqli-vulnerability-in-wp-statistics-plugin,"['WordPress', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Database', 'Security', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Organizations', 'Encryption', 'Passwords', 'Authentication', 'Retail', 'E-Commerce']"
no,NoSQL injection bugs in Rocket.Chat left servers open to RCE attacks,Enterprise messaging platform forced to spill secrets,"Two newly patched bugs in Rocket.Chat made it possible for attackers to mount a series of attacks that ultimately led to remote code execution (RCE) on host servers.Rocket.Chat is a popular open source enterprise messaging platform whose customers include Lloyd’s, Lockheed Martin, and the University of California, Irvine.Three-stage attackRocket.Chat uses the MongoDB NoSQL database to store its data. During an examination of Rocket.Chat’s source code, researchers at SonarSource found two NoSQL injection vulnerabilities in the web interface that enabled attackers to send arbitrary commands to the backend database.Adversaries could exploit the bugs to hijack user accounts, escalate privileges, and execute arbitrary system commands on the host server, SonarSource found.RECOMMENDED Making justice secure again: How New Jersey Courts tackled the rush to remote working at the start of the Covid-19 pandemicThe first vulnerability was in the password reset API and was accessible to unauthenticated users. An attacker could exploit it to leak password reset tokens and hijack unprivileged user accounts.Having gained authenticated access to the API, the attacker could then exploit a second NoSQL vulnerability to leak the email, password hash, and 2FA secret of any account. The attacker could use this to hijack an admin account, even if it was protected by 2FA.Finally, through the admin account, the attacker could use Rocket.Chat’s ‘integrations’ feature to create a webhook that sends system commands to the host server.Circumventing 2FAThe first vulnerability could only be exploited to hijack accounts not protected by two-factor authentication (2FA).??It should be noted that Rocket.Chat enables 2FA by default, although server admins can decide to override the default and users can always choose to disable 2FA.“The recommendation is always to make the use of 2FA mandatory by default and educate the users about the importance of having additional security mechanisms enabled,” Bruno Cestari, security engineer at Rocket.Chat, told The Daily Swig.Read more of the latest database security news“Even the scenario of a low-privileged user not using the 2FA can be dangerous because if an attacker hijacks any trusted account, it can be used to perform social engineering inside the company to exfiltrate private data.”The second vulnerability was even more critical because it circumvented all forms of 2FA.“In this case, 2FA does not really protect admins, or any other user,” Paul Gerste, vulnerability researcher at SonarSource, told The Daily Swig. “Attackers can leak all data that is associated with a user, including 2FA-related information.”The threat of NoSQL injectionResearchers at SonarSource helped the Rocket.Chat team patch both NoSQL injection vulnerabilities by implementing type checks and stronger restrictions on input parameters for the vulnerable web APIs.“It seems that NoSQL Injections are not as well-understood as SQL injections among developers,” Gerste said.“There are also fewer libraries (at least in the JavaScript/Typescript ecosystem) that help with securely handling NoSQL queries with user input than there are for SQL. We don’t think that Rocket.Chat is an outlier here, we would expect to see similar issues in other projects of that size.”On a brighter note, Rocket.Chat’s Cestari underlined the power of open source security.“[SonarSource] reported [the vulnerabilities] in a very detailed way, providing all information we needed to reproduce the issue,” he said.“That was ultimately useful for our team to understand the problem and work on a fix. This case is an important example of how open source projects can contribute to the security of our community.”Full technical details can be found on the SonarSource blog.READ MORE Cockpit CMS flaws exposed web servers to NoSQL injection exploits",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nosql-injection-bugs-in-rocket-chat-left-servers-open-to-rce-attacks,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Passwords', 'API', 'Authentication', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'JavaScript', 'Social', 'Engineering', '2FA', 'RCE']"
no,Making justice secure again: How New Jersey Courts tackled the rush to remote working at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic,Security and data handling were at the top of the IT agenda,"New Jersey Courts’ IT security team have shared how they switched to secure remote working with just three days’ notice as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold last year.Speaking at the RSA Conference 2021 this week, Jack McCarthy and Sajed Naseem, respectively CIO and CISO of the US state court system, explained to delegates how they enabled thousands of colleagues to work from home almost overnight.While they were not the only workforce to face this problem, as industries around the world shut down their sites to halt the spread, they did face a uniquely difficult task.For example, not only did they have to be able to communicate efficiently, they also had to ensure justice was served fairly with no interruptions from unwelcome visitors.“Clearly the hackers were using Covid-19 to remain active and to get even more active in terms of that moment,” Naseem said, explaining that they were facing everything from an increase in coronavirus-related phishing campaigns, to the threat of outsiders jumping in on video calls.Read more of the latest coronavirus phishing and scams newsMcCarthy explained that New Jersey Courts is different to most other US states in that it handles both courts of law and equity – meaning that it oversees all cases from parking ticket violations to serious crimes.In March 2020, at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, the judiciary had more than 13,000 staff members using 50,000 IT devices.The IT team was given just three days’ notice to enable staff to work from home, given the escalating crisis in New York and New Jersey at the time.Luckily, explained McCarthy, they already had security practices in place such as the use of site-to-site VPNs and the mandatory use of two-factor authentication.However, with only 2,500 staff devices capable of being used remotely, these measures alone didn’t solve their dilemma.Overnight changesMcCarthy recounted how he was playing golf one Sunday evening when he got the call to say they were moving to a work-from-home model the very next day.Overnight, 95% of workers had been told to stay at home – a stark contrast to pre-pandemic, when 99% were in-house.Originally, court sessions were still taking place on the premises, though by the Wednesday it was clear that these too had to take place remotely.Firstly, the team had to scale up by quadrupling their current VPN package, which was formatted to process 2,500 devices, but in reality could “only handle 500 or 600”, said McCarthy.YOU MAY LIKE Nintendo hacker sentencing postponed due to coronavirus-related court delaysNext, developers had to expand the online case management system to ensure that all documents and payments could be submitted securely.

Luckily the IT department had already fully encrypted each device, meaning they “were in a good, secure place to allow that to happen”, said McCarthy.Finally, the department migrated to Microsoft Teams in just one day.‘Security first’Looking forward, McCarthy said the days of court sessions taking place fully in-house are “over” as New Jersey Courts continues to adopt a “security first” approach to protect citizens and preserve a fair justice system.“We’re instituting zero trust so that we know how to deal in the future with SolarWinds and other attacks,” said McCarthy.“And just making sure that we’re pushing the envelope as much as we can to ensure that whatever we’re doing, we’re doing securely because we have the public’s trust and confidence in our data processes and procedures.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Ransomware attacks on shipping, logistics organizations rising as coronavirus vaccine supply chain targeted",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/making-justice-secure-again-how-new-jersey-courts-tackled-the-rush-to-remote-working-at-the-start-of-the-covid-19-pandemic,"['Coronavirus', 'DevSecOps', 'Legal', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'Authentication', 'Events', 'US', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Phishing', 'VPN', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Organizations', 'Government', 'North', 'America', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Microsoft']"

no,"Opera security team discloses multiple flaws in open source web proxy, Privoxy",First chapter in security audit series released,"Opera has publicly disclosed six serious vulnerabilities that were discovered in a security audit of Privoxy, the open source web proxy software.Opera, the developer of a Chromium-based browser, has begun a series of blog posts, the first written by security engineer Joshua Rogers, to examine the security posture of today’s open source proxies.The first investigation cantered around Privoxy, released in 2001 and described as a “non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious internet junk”.Privoxy was once a primary way to enter the Tor network and is still recommended by the Tor Project.Hot fuzzThe Opera security team performed a fuzzing assessment, in which automated software can be used to generate salvos of unexpected, random, or invalid inputs to applications under test.This type of exercise can reveal errors in how data is handled. And if a program is stressed to the point of a system crash, researchers can then trace the issue to find vulnerable elements that require fixing.RELATED Google launches Fuzzilli grant program to boost JS engine fuzzing researchOpera used the open source proxy’s own fuzzing framework, alongside partial parsing with a separator, during the audit – a decision the organization says meant they “were able to fuzz Privoxy more similarly to how it would be run in a real-world setting”.The vulnerabilities found in Privoxy, versions before 3.0.32, were:CVE-2021-20276: Buffer overflow in pcre_compile(), leading to denial of service (DoS).CVE-2021-20217: An assertion failure triggered by a crafted CGI request causing DoS.CVE-2021-20272: Another assertion issue in the config gateway that could cause system crashes.CVE-2021-20273: If Privoxy is toggled off, DoS can occur via a crafted CGI request. CVE-2021-20275: A invalid read in chunked_body_is_complete() could cause a crash.CVE-2021-20274: A Null-pointer dereference problem that can lead to a system crash.The majority of the issues were present in the proxy’s internal configuration gateway, a technology used to alter Privoxy settings during a browser session without accessing the main server.This is possible by visiting http://p.p/ or http://config.privoxy.org on most setups.Catch up on the latest browser security newsSpeaking to The Daily Swig, Rogers explained that a common setup is the “pi-hole”, the use of Privoxy to block adverts that trigger JavaScript, as well as a means to access the Tor anonymity network without the Tor browser.Breaking privacy“Being able to crash or cause any security issue for Privoxy uses, via a website on the darknet (within the context of Tor), or being able to cause damage to users blocking ads using Privoxy (within the context of some ad network) is a very lucrative use case,” Rogers commented.“Specifically for Privoxy, given it’s designed for privacy, breaking its security is a fairly real-world implication in of itself.”During fuzzing, Opera also found five other non-security bugs including undefined behavior, uninitialized memory reads, and two issues in Privoxy’s own “fuzzing mode” code.Fabian Keil, the developer of Privoxy, has resolved the flaws, with fixes available through patches bundled with the latest (stable) version of the technology, Privoxy v.3.0.32.Opera selected Pivoxy due to its small and simple codebase.

Disruption to its services is expected to continue into the week.The HSE is currently working to restore its IT systems and said it was working with authorities and cybersecurity experts.The agency said: “There are serious concerns about the implications for patient care arising from the very limited access to diagnostics, lab services, and historical patient records.”It added: “Our priority is keeping our patients safe and maintaining essential care and support services.”Clean-up operationThe HSE said it is “clear” that some data has been encrypted, and has also stated it would not pay the ransom demand.Offering an update on the situation, the healthcare agency said approximately 2,000 IT patient facing systems are currently being put through a “rigorous process of assessment and recovery”.An additional 80,000 HSE-managed devices will also be assessed, while progress is already underway to clean up servers and restore internet access.The HSE said: “This is in line with the pace we had anticipated, and is a stepped, methodical process, to mitigate the risk of re-infection.“We are also looking at interim solutions to get some servers back online in a proven safe way.”Victim of crimeBrian Honan, CEO of BH Consulting and head of Ireland’s Computer Security Incident Response Team (IRISS-CERT) told The Daily Swig: “We have to remember the HSE are the victims of a crime and should be viewed that way.“The people responsible for the crime are the criminals behind this attack and that is where our focus should be.“Later, when all systems are restored then a review can be held to determine if things could have been done more effectively.”Honan added that ransomware is rife in Ireland, which is “no different than many other countries with ransomware attacks being quite common”.He added: “We have assisted several companies recover from such attacks.

no,GitLab tackles crypto-mining abuse with payment card checks for free accounts,Security control could be rolled out more widely if it fails to halt rise in abuse,"UPDATED A surge in crypto-mining abuse on GitLab has prompted the DevOps platform to mandate that even customers with free accounts must include payment card details in order to use its pipeline services.The San Francisco-based company says it has introduced the measure in part because the problem was creating “performance issues”.“Recently, there has been a massive uptick in abuse of free pipeline minutes available on GitLab.com and on other CI/CD providers to mine cryptocurrencies,” said GitLab in a blog post announcing the change.Read the latest DevSecOps news from around the world“In addition to the cost increases, the abuse creates intermittent performance issues for GitLab.com users and requires our teams to work 24/7 to maintain optimal services for our customers and users.”Wayne Haber, director of engineering at GitLab, told The Daily Swig that “the scale of the abuse goes up and down over time based on” mitigations put in place by CI/CD vendors and “fluctuations in the value of the cryptocurrencies”.As of yesterday (May 17), GitLab said it “will require new free users to provide a valid credit or debit card number in order to use shared runners on GitLab.com”.The payment cards will not be charged but instead will be verified with a one-dollar authorization transaction.New, free SaaS users who decline to provide card details will not have access to any GitLab features relying on pipelines, unless they use their own runner and disable shared runners.“Although imperfect, we believe this solution will reduce the abuse,” the company explained.Scope for expansionUsers who created a GitLab account before May 17 will be exempt from the new security control, along with GitLab self-managed users, and paying or program users.However, GitLab said it was ready to widen the scope of the new measure if the changes fail to have the desired effect.“If we continue to see abuse through existing free accounts, we plan to extend the requirement to additional users,” it explained.Wayne Haber commented: “A number of months ago when the abuse first occurred, there were isolated performance issues. We quickly resolved the incident and made it public per our value of transparency. He continued: “As they adapt, we adapt. We will continue to respond and adapt so that our users are not impacted.”READ MORE Microsoft releases free online ‘playbooks’ to help businesses defend against cyber-attacksGitLab said previous measures it had taken to deter illicit crypto-mining had been “helpful” but “not sufficient” in achieving this aim.These have included failing pipelines and the creation of jobs when pipeline minutes quotas are exceeded, restrictions to the creation of namespaces via the API, enabling the termination of pipelines when blocking users, and preventing pipelines from running if owned by blocked users.The software development organization has also closed gaps between jobs running through user accounts deleted by users, and enhanced its external pipeline validation service.“We believe using pipeline minute quotas as the foundation for free minute usage will be the best mechanism for failing jobs and pipelines to stop abuse,” said GitLab.Non-paying GitLab users can use up to 400 free CI/CD minutes each month.Colossal energy consumptionCrypto-mining, or cryptocurrency mining, verifies cybercurrency transactions by leveraging the processing power of computers to solve complex mathematical problems.Cybercriminals can profit from the technique by infecting target machines with ‘cryptojacking’ malware and corralling them into botnets that generate illicit profits from these transactions.Haber said mooted changes to how cryptocurrencies are validated could be a game-changer.“Most cryptocurrency mining requires significant CPU compute power for doing ‘proof of work’ operations. This takes significant power and cooling for those doing this at scale,” he explained. “It also encourages abusers to steal CPU power. “Some cryptocurrencies are planning to move away from current methods of validation to ‘proof of stake’ operations which require much less compute resources. If successful, this will not only reduce the costs and environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, but also should reduce the incentive for abusers to steal compute resources.”It could also boost the value of cryptocurrencies, given how Bitcoin’s value plunged last week after Tesla co-founder Elon Musk said the electric car maker would no longer accept the cryptocurrency as payment because its colossal energy consumption was hampering the fight against climate change.This article was updated on May 19 with the addition of comments from Wayne Haber of GitLab.RELATED Vulnerability in Nagios XI exploited by cryptojacking crooks to hijack systems",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/gitlab-tackles-crypto-mining-abuse-with-payment-card-checks-for-free-accounts,"['Cryptojacking', 'DevOps', 'Authentication', 'Malware', 'Phishing', 'Cryptocurrency', 'DevSecOps', 'Organizations', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News', 'North', 'America', 'US', 'Finance', 'API', 'Blockchain']"
no,AXA ransomware attack comes just days after insurer pulled coverage for cyber-attack class in France,"Third party, fire, and (ransomware) theft","Insurance giant AXA has been hit by a massive ransomware attack, just days after announcing that it would no longer cover damage from that class of cyber-attack in France.The attack – targeted against AXA’s Asia Assistance division – hit IT operations in Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines.It’s believed to have been carried out by the Avaddon ransomware group. Cybercriminals seemingly tied to the group subsequentially claimed they had stolen three terabytes of data, including personal data and medical records.“Avaddon’s affiliate model in essence means that anyone can become [an] affiliate and utilize their tools/malware in exchange for a percentage of the profits made in the particular attack,” said Hugo van den Toorn, manager of offensive security at Outpost24.“Although identifying the Avaddon gang is trivial, it will still remain hard to identify what this particular affiliate’s motivation is to attack AXA.”Damage controlAXA claims that there’s no evidence that any further data was accessed beyond IPA in Thailand. It added that a dedicated taskforce with external forensic experts is investigating.“AXA takes data privacy very seriously and if IPA’s investigations confirms that sensitive data of any individuals have been affected, the necessary steps will be taken to notify and support all corporate clients and individuals impacted,” the insurer said in a statement.Catch up on the latest ransomware news and analysisAXA hasn’t said what ransom figure has been demanded, or whether it plans to pay. However, the attack comes just days after an announcement by the company that its cyber insurance policies would no longer cover ransomware payments in France.France has suffered heavily from ransomware attacks, and authorities believe that organizations should not pay because any payment serves to incentivize further attacks.Last month, during a Senate roundtable in Paris, cybercrime prosecutor Johanna Brousse told officials: “The word to get out today is that, regarding ransomware, we don’t pay and we won’t pay.”An AXA spokesperson told The Daily Swig: “In this context, AXA France, which had added an option to its range in this respect, deemed it appropriate to suspend marketing until the consequences of these analyses are drawn and the framework for insurance intervention is clarified.”Collateral damageAccording to Robert Hannigan, chairman of BlueVoyant International, criminalizing ransom payments is unlikely to cause the ransomware business to dry up.“While everyone agrees that funnelling billions of dollars into crime is a bad thing, and most agree that paying terrorists or sanctioned states should be unlawful, crudely banning all payments is likely to damage victims more than attackers,” he says.And Catherine Mulligan, head of cyber at Aon’s Reinsurance Solutions business, says that underwriting ransoms is perfectly feasible, as long as organizations are well enough prepared.READ MORE Magecart Group 12 unleashes stealthy PHP skimmer against vulnerable Magento stores“Ransomware attack vectors have remained remarkably unchanged, which means insurers can underwrite to specific controls,” she told The Daily Swig.“Basic cybersecurity hygiene and controls go a long way to preventing attacks.

no,Magecart Group 12 unleashes stealthy PHP skimmer against vulnerable Magento e-commerce sites,Server-side requests to malicious domain conceal malware from endpoint security tools,"UPDATED Novel credit card skimming malware that easily evades client-side detection has been deployed against e-commerce sites running unsupported versions of Magento, security researchers have found.The campaign has been attributed to Magecart Group 12, since it uses infrastructure previously linked to the group and the new malware is disguised as a favicon – an image file containing a brand logo displayed on browser tabs.The new strain, which has the file name ‘Magento.png’, gains a foothold on target websites via a PHP web shell, unlike similar favicon-imitating skimmers that hide malicious JavaScript code.End of the lineJérôme Segura, lead malware threat intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes, told The Daily Swig that his team detected the malware on “a few dozen sites” running Magento 1, “which was enough to see a pattern”.The latest and final Magento 1 version is still estimated to power nearly 53,000 e-commerce sites, almost 11 months after Adobe discontinued support for the release line.Magecart 12 threat actors were also blamed for a wave of attacks in September 2020 that leveraged another innovative skimmer, dubbed ‘Ant and Cockroach’ by RiskIQ, and impacted approaching 3,000 domains running Magento 1.BACKGROUND Magecart attacks: Cat-and-mouse game continues between cybercrooks and law enforcementThe prolific group has also been credited with the use of a decoy Cloudflare library and the covert installation of cryptocurrency miners on vulnerable websites.“One aspect that we still aren't quite sure about is whether they are directly implicated in the compromise of websites,” said Segura. “It's quite possible that they buy access to sites where shells have been uploaded already.”Sneaking through server-sideMagecart-style attacks traditionally use web injections to deploy JavaScript code on Magento websites and exfiltrate payment card information from customers.According to Malwarebytes’ latest research, the Magento.png attack uses PHP web shells called ‘Smilodon’ or ‘Megalodon’ to dynamically inject JavaScript skimming code into the target site, according to a blog post published by Segura last week.Requests to the malicious domain are done server-side, circumventing detection or blocking by client-side security tools.Read more of the latest security research news from around the worldThe “domain/IP database approach” commonly deployed to thwart conventional client-side skimming attacks would not work against the new malware “unless all compromised stores were blacklisted, which is a catch-22 situation”, reads the blog post.An alternative approach, inspecting the DOM in real time and detecting when malicious code has been loaded, is “more effective, but also more complex and prone to false positives”, added Segura.Faulty PHP scriptMagento.png “attempts to pass itself as ‘image/png’ but does not have the proper PNG format for a valid image file”, he continued.Vulnerable sites are compromised “by replacing the legitimate shortcut icon tags with a path to the fake PNG file.”However, Segura noted that “in its current implementation this PHP script won’t be loaded properly”.Some sites infected “already had an existing skimmer in place,” the researcher told The Daily Swig. “The PHP shell could have been triggered in a number of ways and we did find it odd that it was tied to the favicon. In previous attempts we had seen malicious JavaScript loaded inside the favicon placeholder which made sense, but this PHP wasn't meant to work the same way.“Nevertheless, this campaign gave us some good insights into what the malware can do and what potentially lies ahead. As defenders are blocking web skimming infrastructure at a rapid pace, it makes sense to perform skimming and data exfiltration out of the client-side scope where security products work.”Segura also urged online merchants to keep their stores “up-to-date and hardened, not only to pass PCI standards but also to maintain the trust shoppers place in them”.According to a scan of Magento websites performed by cybersecurity firm Foregenix in July 2020, a few days after vendor support was discontinued, 79.6% of malware-infected domains were running Magento 1.This article was updated with comments from Jérôme Segura of Malwarebytes on May 17RELATED XSS in the wild: JavaScript-stuffed orders used to compromise Japanese e-commerce sites",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/magecart-group-12-unleashes-stealthy-php-skimmer-against-vulnerable-magento-e-commerce-sites,"['Malware', 'Cybercrime', 'Research', 'Magecart', 'E-Commerce', 'Retail', 'Fraud', 'Industry', 'News', 'Adobe', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Browsers', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'PHP', 'JavaScript', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Surveillance', 'Secure', 'Development']"
yes,Microsoft releases free online ‘playbooks’ to help businesses defend against cyber-attacks,Tech giant provides advice for organizations on how to protect their networks,"Microsoft has released a series of incident response ‘playbooks’ offering advice to businesses and organizations on how to defend against cyber-attacks.The free, online guides were published earlier this month in response to “widespread” attack campaigns that have the potential to cripple businesses around the world.To help organizations respond quickly to attacks, Microsoft has produced detailed incident response guides to the Microsoft Server Exchange hack and Nobellium/Solorigate attacks.RELATED Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowIn addition to distributing knowledge on specific campaigns, Microsoft has also released playbooks covering common attack methods, including phishing, password spraying, and app consent.Microsoft’s new incident response playbooks cover specific campaigns and common attack vectorsThese guides contain practical advice on how to prevent attacks, as well as handy resources such as security checklists.A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to The Daily Swig that more guides will be released via the Azure Active Directory Identity Blog.“We constantly provide guidance on a wide range of topics and get very positive feedback from our customers,” the spokesperson said.Encouraging moveSpeaking to The Daily Swig, George Daglas, chief operating officer at Obrela Security Industries, said the move by Microsoft has come at the right time.Daglas said: “It is encouraging to see that Microsoft is pushing for content creation, use cases, and incident response playbooks.“This is because, apart from the direct benefits such content has in itself, it acts as a paradigm demonstrating that addressing cybersecurity challenges is not just a matter of selecting the best-of-breed technologies but managing to effectively operationalize them.”Read more of the latest cyber-attack newsBoris Cipot, senior security engineer at Synopsys, commented that the playbooks are “a good starting point”.“They act as a helpful tool for IT specialists to learn and get ideas for further research,” he said. “They show the user a simple way to identify problems.“While it’s not the only step that organizations should take, it’s certainly a valuable resource to have on hand.”The engineer added: “In my opinion, this is a promising step forward.“I look forward to more playbooks being released in the future – particularly, because the Microsoft Security Research Center is a team full of professionals who are incredibly savvy when it comes to new and emerging threats.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE UK government releases free cyber-threat warning tool at annual CyberUK conference",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/microsoft-releases-online-playbooks-to-help-businesses-defend-against-cyber-attacks,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Microsoft', 'Education', 'US', 'Hacking', 'News', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Phishing', 'Organizations', 'Cybercrime', 'DevOps', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Authentication', 'Privacy', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Enterprise', 'Analysis', 'North', 'America', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Malware', 'Ransomware', 'Compliance', 'Passwords']"
no,Analysis: Colonial Pipeline’s $5m ransomware payment risks perpetuating cybercrime ‘feedback loop’,Will the colossal payout further embolden financially-motivated cybercrooks?,"Reports that Colonial Pipeline paid a $5 million ransom to restore operations on the US’ largest fuel pipeline send cybercriminals an unfortunate signal, security professionals have told The Daily Swig.Conducted by the DarkSide ransomware gang, last week’s attack on the Colonial Pipeline Company forced the organization to shut down around 5,500 miles of pipeline, disrupting fuel supplies to the east coast and causing gasoline shortages in the southeast.Faced with the prospect of further disruption, it’s easy to see why a company generating annual revenues exceeding $500 million would pay the eye-watering sum (reportedly in cryptocurrency, within hours of the attack).BACKGROUND Colonial Pipeline cyber-attack: DarkSide ransomware details emerge as US urges critical infrastructure operators to be vigilantIn doing so, however, the critical infrastructure company perpetuates a “feedback loop of malicious activity” that “allows the groups to achieve a greater level of sophistication during their next attacks, whether that be via training, new tooling, purchasing credentials, or recruitment,” according to Mitch Mellard, threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity outfit Talion.“There is no guarantee that they will even decrypt your files or avoid leaking them,” he told The Daily Swig. “Recent figures have highlighted an alarming number of ransomware groups that are paid off but never deliver a working decryptor.”Indeed, a Kaspersky survey recently found that, of 56% of consumer ransomware victims who paid off extortionists, 17% still failed to get their data back.Such concerns informed a joint advisory issued on Tuesday by the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that once again urges victim organizations not to pay ransoms.Rise in ransomware attacksYesterday (May 13), US telecoms multinational Verizon became the latest company to publish figures demonstrating an increase in ransomware attacks last year.Often targeting organizations involved in the fight against Covid-19, ransomware attacks were a factor in 10% of data breaches analyzed by Verizon, more than double the proportion observed in 2019.The telco’s 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report suggested “this may have less to do with” the global migration to a home-based workforce “than it does the shift in tactics of the actors who ‘named and shamed’ their victims.Catch up on the latest ransomware news and attacksVerizon was referring to the growing trend of ransomware gangs exfiltrating as well as encrypting compromised data and blackmailing victims with the threat of public data exposure.However, Martin Jartelius, chief security officer at infosec assessment platform Outpost24, suggests the increase is also fueled by ransomware’s intrinsic ‘efficiency’.“In a typical attack when hackers breach a system, they need to sift through the data, determine which data are valuable, exfiltrate the information back, cover their tracks, find a bidder who is prepared to pay for the information,” he told The Daily Swig.“But with ransomware, the information they steal is so targeted they already know that the affected organization would be willing to pay for it.”‘Scot free’Meanwhile, Andy Norton, European cyber risk officer at enterprise security platform Armis, told The Daily Swig: “If I want to insure a car, I have to have an MOT, a third-party certificate of road worthiness. However, in cyber, I can have completely inappropriate levels of cybersecurity and still get cyber insurance.“Colonial have been publicly embarrassed by the saga, and yet, have essentially got away scot free, and in doing so, have sent a message that it’s OK not to demonstrate any sort of compliance with a cybersecurity framework, as long as your insurer will cover the costs of an attack.”The escalating ransomware crisis prompted the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to warn companies last October that they risked US sanctions if they made ransomware payments paid to parties designated as malicious cyber actors under OFAC’s cyber-related sanctions program.Verizon’s latest annual snapshot of the data breach landscape also spotlighted a rise in phishing attacks, and a 15-fold jump in breaches where attackers ‘misrepresented’ their identity to victims more generally.Attacks on web applications, which last year became the number one attack vector in data breaches, were the main hacking vector in 80% of breaches this time round, following by desktop sharing.RELATED Ransomware attacks on shipping organizations rising as coronavirus vaccine supply chain targeted",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/analysis-colonial-pipelines-5m-ransomware-payment-risks-perpetuating-cybercrime-feedback-loop,"['Ransomware', 'Analysis', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Network', 'Security', 'Malware', 'Phishing', 'Research', 'Compliance', 'Coronavirus', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Encryption', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News']"
yes,All major desktop browsers vulnerable to tracking flaw that can bypass privacy tools – research,"Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Tor Browser all affected by ‘scheme flooding’ attacks","A vulnerability that can allow websites to identify and track users, bypassing privacy protections, is present in multiple major browsers, researchers have warned.The flaw can allow a site to assign users a permanent unique identifier and use this to trace their behavior across different browsers – even if they are using a VPN, private browsing session, or other privacy-preserving tools and techniques.Dubbed ‘scheme flooding’, the issue has been present in browsers for at least five years – and despite the fact there is no evidence it is being actively exploited on a large scale, researchers warn that the issue is nevertheless a “violation of privacy”.The vulnerability was identified by security researchers at FingerprintJS, who found that they were able to launch scheme flooding exploits in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Tor Browser.Checking it outBrowsers can generate a 32-bit cross-browser device identifier by testing a list of 32 applications and checking if they are installed on a user’s device.According to researchers, on average, the fingerprinting process takes a few seconds and works across desktop Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.Custom URL scheme handling is used to check whether the application in question has been installed – this is used to allow a browser to open the app via a pop-up configuration box.Read more of the latest browser security newsExplaining the steps needed to exploit the vulnerability, the researchers wrote:Prepare a list of application URL schemes that you want to test. The list may depend on your goals, for example, if you want to check if some industry or interest-specific applications are installed.Add a script on a website that will test each application from your list. The script will return an ordered array of boolean values. Each boolean value is true if the application is installed or false if it is not.Use this array to generate a permanent cross-browser identifier.Optionally, use machine learning algorithms to guess your website visitors’ occupation, interests, and age using installed application data.Bypassing protectionsToday’s web browsers have built-in security mechanisms that are designed to protect users’ privacy. However, these mechanisms can be bypassed with scheme flooding.Safari, Firefox, and Tor Browser, which is built on the Firefox codebase, are vulnerable due to the exploitation of the same-origin policy implementation.The blog post reads: “Every time you navigate to an unknown URL scheme, Firefox will show you an internal page with an error. This internal page has a different origin than any other website, so it is impossible to access it because of the same-origin policy limitation.“On the other hand, a known custom URL scheme will be opened as about:blank, whose origin will be accessible from the current website.”DON’T FORGET TO READ What the FLoC? Everything you need to know about Google’s new ad tech that aims to replace third-party cookiesThe researchers added: “By opening a pop-up window with a custom URL scheme and checking if its document is available from JavaScript code, you can detect if the application is installed on the device.”Chrome was the only browser that already has some protections against scheme flooding, but even this can be bypassed. The FingerprintJS researchers noted that the issue has been flagged by the Chromium bug tracker and will be fixed soon.Interestingly, although Tor Browser – which was built to offer enhanced anonymity for privacy-conscious users – is vulnerable, it took researchers much longer to exploit it.MitigationsTo protect against the vulnerability, the researchers noted that “until this vulnerability is fixed, the only way to have private browsing sessions not associated with your primary device is to use another device altogether”.The Daily Swig has reached out to developers at Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Tor Browser for more information of when a fix will be available.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Google and Mozilla unveil plans to bake HTML sanitization into their browsers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/all-major-desktop-browsers-vulnerable-to-tracking-flaw-that-can-bypass-privacy-tools-research,"['Browsers', 'Privacy', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Chrome', 'firefox', 'Safari', 'VPN', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Surveillance', 'XS-Leak', 'Apple', 'Linux', 'Google', 'Mozilla', 'JavaScript', 'OpSec', 'OSINT', 'Tor', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'AI']"
no,Open Distro bug exposed servers to SSRF exploits,Research highlights need for sysadmins to ‘lock down any features that end customers can access’,"A newly patched bug in Open Distro, a software package that includes Elasticsearch and Kibana, enabled adversaries to gain unauthorized access to server and network resources.The bug, discovered and reported by security researcher Rotem Bar, allowed privileged users to enumerate listening services or interact with configured resources via HTTP requests in the network of the Open Distro server, also known as server-side request forgery (SSRF).Webhooks and SSRFOpen Distro adds many new features to Elasticsearch and makes it easy to interact with the underlying API. While investigating the software, Bar found a web module that allowed users to create an “open distro module” and define a customizable webhook to any resource in the network.Bar was able to use this module to create a webhook that ran SSRF requests and scanned the network, accessed the metadata API, the Kubernetes API, and other local resources.An attacker could take the scheme further to identify other vulnerabilities in the services running in the local servers and use them to stage more complicated attacks, the researcher said.Read more server-side request forgery newsBar was able to narrow down the vulnerability to a line of code in Open Distro that creates HTTP requests based upon user input and sends them without doing any validation.The severity of the bug depends on the environment of the installation. For example, if only known administrators can access the Elasticsearch instance and the service is isolated from other network resources, then the risk is low.However, if the Elasticsearch instance is accessible to all users within and outside the company, then the severity increases. And if there are no measures to restrict access between servers, it can lead to critical incidents.Misconfigurations“When installing Open Distro, it includes lots of services out-of-the-box, and one of them is the alerting module which enables the creation of webhook monitors,” Bar said.In a blog post that details the vulnerability, Bar explains how web admins can check to see if their Open Distro installation includes the module in question and how they can disable it.“There is a way to remove these plugins and configure them, but they are not intuitive and mostly configured from the file configuration and not from the UI,” Bar said. “Some integrators I've encountered did not know of these options. Even now after this fix, which adds the ability to add a blocklist to deny resources from internal resources, this is not enabled by default.”RECOMMENDED Aurelia framework’s default HTML sanitizer opens the door to XSS attacksThe latest version of Open Distro has resolved the issue. In addition to installing updates, Bar recommended general protective measures such as enforcing isolation within networks, reducing permissions, monitoring for abusive usage, and considering the deployment of a web application firewall (WAF).“I can say from seeing many security mistakes that you should always assume the worst for any external system that you are not familiar with,” he said.A patchwork of solutionsBar discovered the bug while performing penetration testing on the servers of a client that had combined different solutions into one big tech stack. This is a common practice among many organizations and enterprises that don’t have the in-house software talent and hire system integrators to patch together a working solution.“Large organizations that usually do not have the development capabilities in-house create a public tender and request for services, to answer a specific need of theirs,” Bar told The Daily Swig.“In order to win these tenders, there are companies that instead of developing a product, which can cost a lot, prefer to create a pre-packaged solution based on a number of products they glue together and provide this to the customer.”The problem with this approach is that the finished solution often has more complexity and features than the client needs, which opens unnoticed attack vectors for crafty hackers.This patchwork of solutions also requires configuration, maintenance, and updating procedures that are often beyond the skills of the client.“I think it is great to use open source systems and can cut lots of costs, but we should make sure to lock down any features that end customers can access,” Bar said.“The bigger and more complex the system is, the more likely it is missing or contains an incorrect configuration and through these, an attacker can compromise the entire system.”YOU MIGHT LIKE Jenkins Attack Framework helps uncover little-known vulnerabilities in CI/CD environments",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/open-distro-bug-exposed-servers-to-ssrf-exploits,"['Vulnerabilities', 'SSRF', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'API', 'Network', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'WAF', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise']"
no,"Shift right: Developers knowingly release insecure applications, says report","Concerns surface about resource constraints, information sharing, and buck-passing in the workplace","Many software developers working for large organizations admit to releasing applications they know to be insecure, a new report has revealed.According to findings published today (May 13) by Osterman Research, 81% of developers who took part in the study made this admission, with those occupying senior roles the worst offenders.Survey respondents who described their roles as ‘head of DevOps’ or ‘development manager’ were more than twice as likely as front-line development teams to knowingly committing insecure code ‘often’ – 20% for the former versus 9%They were also less likely to say they ‘never’ released insecure code (20% and 18%, compared to 27% of developers).Sean Wright, principal application security engineer at Immersive Labs, which sponsored the report, lamented the widespread misconception among developers that security teams are solely responsible for, and capable of, preventing or mitigating all risks.He told The Daily Swig: “I think that developers are under enormous pressure to deliver new features.“When this is combined with a general lack of awareness of the potential risk and implications, they likely determine the risk is worth it.”Wright added that senior developers might also be more inclined to feel “they have the experience to make that judgment call” than their more junior colleagues.READ MORE Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowPerhaps unsurprisingly, then, only 61% of developers and 44% of security pros polled thought their application build environment was secure enough to withstand a dedicated attack like the devastating, nation state-backed exploitation of SolarWinds vulnerabilities earlier this year.Shift nowhereAlthough security and development teams mostly endorse ‘shifting left’ – whereby security is embedded throughout the development process from the very start – many believe the trend is hindered by resource constraints.Asked when security should be incorporated into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), both developers and security pros most frequently said the earliest possible stage, known as ‘requirements analysis’ – 29% and 36% respectively.Catch up on the latest secure software development newsHowever, only 45% of front-line developers felt they had enough time to learn how to create secure applications – while 40% of security respondents admitted they lacked a comprehensive understanding of the SDLC.Similarly, modest proportions of security workers believed their team had sufficient time and resources to support shift left (39%), help development teams secure applications (44%), and address prioritized vulnerabilities (50%).‘Outdated and insufficient’When it comes to application security threat intelligence, significantly fewer front-line developers and security staff said they had access to such information compared to their senior counterparts.The gap was particularly wide for developers, with twice the number of senior DevOps staff (63%) saying they had timely access to security information than their more junior colleagues (36%).Curiously, however, 76% of developers said they received threat information from the security team on a daily or weekly basis.Meanwhile, more than half of security pros said application security training was provided to engineering and development teams daily, weekly, or monthly.Nevertheless, the report claims that “the techniques and approaches currently used for sharing information, education, and training are outdated and insufficient”.A collective effortFront-line developers were also much less likely than their more senior colleagues to view application security as a critical part of their responsibilities (27% versus 80%) and to claim they understood the latest security threats (64% versus 80% for DevOps leads).Sean Wright of Immersive Labs said organizations must “foster a security culture and make sure that everyone in the organization understands that they all have a part to play when it comes to security”.He also called for improved awareness of security vulnerabilities, “regular crisis exercises”, a “move away from alert boxes”, and attempts to foster understanding among developers and security professionals of the “frustrations” faced by each other’s teams.The findings were based on a poll of 260 developers and security staff at US and UK organizations with an average workforce size of 14,000.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/shift-right-developers-knowingly-release-insecure-applications-says-report,"['DevSecOps', 'Organizations', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Research', 'DevOps', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News', 'UK', 'US', 'Europe', 'North', 'America']"

The DevOps tool often stores powerful credentials, proprietary code, and more.“Historically, Jenkins is not securely configured by default,” JAF developer Shelby Spencer, formerly of Accenture, tells The Daily Swig. “It is often set up and maintained by developers and not security or IT personnel, so it is often a soft target.”Read more about the latest open source hacking tools“If you ask any red team or pen tester what their 10 most common targets are in an environment, most of them would list Jenkins in that list – and yet there are no all-in-one tools for attacking Jenkins that I could find.”The tool automates and simplifies many common Jenkins attacks and introduces some that may not be well known, Spencer said.Just the jobThe most unique feature of the Jenkins Attack Framework, says Spencer, is the ability to dump credentials using only the ‘Create Job’ feature.“By default, Jenkins shares stored credentials with all users,” the developer said.“Many attackers are familiar with dumping credentials via the Groovy Console as an admin, but it is also possible to do this as a normal user in a normal job – you just have to list all the credentials out one-by-one in your job (which was laborious), then obfuscate them, or Jenkins will redact them in the log.“My tool automates this attack, and it works no matter the operating system of the Jenkins slave.”Going furtherThe tool can also launch what Spencer terms ‘ghost jobs’ – jobs that run on a Jenkins slave that don’t show up in the Jenkins console, and can execute indefinitely in the background.This means that an operator with the relatively limited privileges of ‘create job’ and ‘run job’ can potentially set up long-running socks, proxies, or shells on a Jenkins slave that aren’t visible within Jenkins.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE VSCode integration with ATT&CK framework allows security researchers to maintain focus“I expect and hope that the tool will see wide use and adoption by the red team/pen testing community,” says Spencer.“I have been using it extensively for over a year on engagements as have all my buddies at my prior employer, Accenture.”“I think the tool also has some valuable features for normal Jenkins users as well, such as the feature that allows the dumping of all Jenkin build logs. I hope that the community provides feedback and feature requests.”READ MORE Latest web hacking tools – Q1 2021",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/jenkins-attack-framework-new-tool-helps-uncover-little-known-vulnerabilities-in-ci-cd-environments,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Passwords', 'Authentication', 'Data', 'Leak']"
no,Colonial Pipeline cyber-attack: DarkSide ransomware details emerge as US urges critical infrastructure operators to be vigilant,The malware strain shut down operations at the US fuel provider last week,"Further details related to notorious ransomware DarkSide have emerged, as the FBI urges critical infrastructure operators to adopt a “heightened state of awareness” following the Colonial Pipeline attack.The malware strain first emerged in 2020 with a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) model, meaning that the group behind it launched attacks on behalf of paying clients, or “partners”, rather than simply selling its code.Last week, DarkSide hit the headlines after the group targeted US gas supplier Colonial Pipeline, shutting down operations and raising alarm about the prospect of gasoline shortages.In response, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI have issued a joint advisory on how organizations and other critical services can protect against the malware.Mitigation adviceThe statement released last night (May 11) “urged” critical infrastructure asset owners and operators to “adopt a heightened state of awareness” and implement mitigations including robust network segmentation between IT and OT networks; regularly testing manual controls; and ensuring that backups are implemented, regularly tested, and isolated from network connections.“These mitigations will help C I [critical infrastructure] owners and operators improve their entity’s functional resilience by reducing their vulnerability to ransomware and the risk of severe business degradation if impacted by ransomware,” the advisory adds.An exhaustive list of mitigations and best practices can be found in the advisory, which also condemns the paying of a ransom to cybercrime gangs.Read more of the latest malware newsIt reads: “Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities.“Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. CISA and FBI urge you to report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office.”President Joe Biden also condemned the attack and vowed to “disrupt and prosecute” the responsible actors.Prolific ransomwareAlthough the Colonial Pipeline incident thrust the RaaS strain into the spotlight, DarkSide has been tracked in at least 60 cases already this year, according to researchers from Mandiant FireEye.In a report released last night (May 11), researchers from the threat detection team released further information about DarkSide, which it first encountered on a dark web forum in November 2020.Interestingly, the group behind DarkSide originally stated it would not carry out attacks on hospitals, schools, universities, non-profit organizations, and public sector entities, which FireEye suggested was a tactic to evade law enforcement detection.However, after last week’s attack resulted in the shutdown of critical services in the US – the affected pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day, 45% of the East Coast’s supply of diesel, petrol, and jet fuel – the cybercrime gang took the unusual step of issuing an apology.ApologyIn a statement posted on the DarkSide website, the threat actor appeared to regret this latest incident.The group commented: “We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined goverment (sic) and look for other our motives.“Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society.“From today we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners [customers] want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.”The group also prohibits attacks targeting the Commonwealth of Independent States, which include Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine, suggesting they could reside in one of these countries.FireEye, which also published a detailed timeline of DarkSide’s movements, said that threat actors have “become more proficient at conducting multifaceted extortion operations”, adding that this success has “directly contributed to the rapid increase in the number of high-impact ransomware incidents over the past few years”.Researchers expect to see varying extortion techniques leveraging DarkSide malware that “will continue to evolve throughout 2021”.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Beyond Lazarus: North Korean cyber-threat groups become top-tier, ‘reckless’ adversaries",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/colonial-pipeline-cyber-attack-darkside-ransomware-details-emerge-as-us-urges-critical-infrastructure-operators,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Ransomware', 'Cybercrime', 'Malware', 'US', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Organizations', 'North', 'America', 'Research', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Education', 'Government', 'Logistics']"
no,UK government releases free cyber-threat warning tool at annual CyberUK conference,Announcement comes as GCHQ boss emphasizes need to confront Russia and China on cybersecurity,"UK businesses are to be given free access to a cyber-threat warning service, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has announced.The service filters through trusted threat intelligence sources to offer custom alerts and is designed to give “timely notification about possible incidents and security issues”.It was previously only offered to select parties as an alpha version, but was launched as a beta version on Tuesday (May 11) which will be available free of charge to organizations and institutions across the UK.The tool, called Early Warning, is the latest Active Cyber Defence (ACD) service from the NCSC, and was launched on the opening day of the government agency’s annual conference, which this year is taking place online.Commercial versions of similar services already exist, so the idea is to offer a baseline service to a much larger audience, most of which lack the budget to invest in commercial service.Taking back controlElsewhere during the conference, Jeremy Fleming, director of GCHQ, told delegates that “without action it is increasingly apparent that the key technologies on which we rely for prosperity and security won’t be shaped and controlled by the West”.“We can see significant technology leadership is moving East,” the head of the signal intelligence agency said. “It’s causing a conflict of interests. Of values. Where prosperity and security are at stake.”“And it follows, that cybersecurity is an increasingly strategic issue that needs a whole of nation approach if we are to continue to reap the benefits of technology,” Fleming concluded.READ MORE UK government to review country's aging Computer Misuse Act – officialA key theme of discussion at the previous pre-pandemic edition of CyberUK was how to manage the risk posed by Chinese firm Huawei as an equipment supplier to the UK’s 5G rollout.Now the UK government has decided to instruct telcos to phase out Huawei as a supplier, that particular debate has been settled – but concerns about how China and Russia could use their cyber-muscle as a tool of influence and manipulation across the world remain.Safeguarding cyberspaceDuring the opening speech at day two of CyberUK today (May 12), Dominic Raab, the UK’s foreign secretary, spoke in general terms about the global cyber-threat landscape.“You’ve got authoritarian regimes including North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China using digital tech to sabotage and steal, or to control and censor,” Raab told delegates to CyberUK 2021.“So, how do we safeguard our vision of a free, open, peaceful, and secure cyberspace?”Part of the answer to that question, according to Raab, are plans to invest £22 million in building cyber capacity in Africa and Indo-Pacific.The budget (which represents new UK government spending over an unspecified timescale) will go towards measures such as national cyber response, safety campaigns, and an investigatory hub in Africa.The latter will involve collaborating with Interpol. “The idea of that will be to improve co-operation on cybercrime investigations, and support the countries involved to mount joint operations,” according to Raab.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Beyond Lazarus: North Korean cyber-threat groups become top-tier, ‘reckless’ adversaries",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/uk-government-releases-free-cyber-threat-warning-tool-at-annual-cyberuk-conference,"['UK', 'Government', 'Cyber-attacks', 'NCSC', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Europe', 'Cybercrime', 'Coronavirus', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'China', 'Russia', 'Asia', 'Organizations']"
no,"Beyond Lazarus: North Korean cyber-threat groups become top-tier, ‘reckless’ adversaries",How do you solve a problem like North Korea?,"Crippled by economic sanctions and isolated from the rest of the world bar China, North Korea is increasingly relying on cybercrime to keep its economy running.Over recent years, the North Korea has evolved from a nuisance to its neighbor and rival South Korea and purveyor of ransomware and DDoS attacks to become the scourge of banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.Threat intel experts polled by The Daily Swig said that the tactics and tradecraft of attackers deployed by North Korea have evolved to elevate the country to a top-tier cyber-adversary.This threat extends beyond the notorious Lazarus Group, a crew of cybercriminals blamed for the destructive attack on Sony Pictures in 2014 and the audacious $81 million cyber-heist of reserves held by the Central Bank of Bangladesh in 2016, among other attacks.How sophisticated are North Korean cyber-threat groups?Along with state-sponsored Russian, Chinese, and Iranian threat actors, North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are considered to be among the world’s most sophisticated.The Russian (specifically APT28, APT29, and Turla) and North Korean (specifically Lazarus) threat actors are considered to be the most advanced groups of all due to their capability of using custom toolsets, adopting the latest attack techniques, and the speed of their attacks.According to threat intel vendor IntSights, the advanced capabilities and sophisticated techniques of North Korean groups have included: the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities; the development of custom, proprietary malware; the use of destructive malware and ransomware to delete or encrypt forensic evidence of their activities within compromised networks; and the compromise of high-security targets, such as banks, in order to enable large-scale fraudulent transactions.RELATED Behind the Great Firewall: Chinese cyber-espionage adapts to post-Covid world with stealthier attacksBut these skillsets and techniques are far from restricted to North Korea.Fred Plan, senior analyst of cyber espionage at Mandiant Intelligence, told The Daily Swig that North Korean threat actors differ from other comparably sophisticated groups by being more reckless.“One of the things that makes North Korean actors relatively more dangerous than operations from other countries is that the Pyongyang regime is isolated and disconnected from global economic trade and diplomatic engagement,” Plan explained.“As a result, North Korea isn’t as incentivized to ‘play by the rules’ and the country continues to step over boundaries that define the acceptable behaviors of other nation-states.“This is a key factor as to why only North Korean groups carry out state-sponsored cybercrime, such as digital bank heists, and are relatively more likely to deploy destructive wiper malware,” Plan concluded.How are the tactics of North Korean threat groups evolving?North Korean actors are constantly evolving their techniques, especially their evasion and persistence mechanisms, in order to evade detection by security products.Hossein Jazi, a threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Malwarebytes, commented: “Extensive use of packers, employing steganography to embed their malicious payload within images, erasing footprints from the device at run time, or constantly changing the encryption keys/algorithms (even within an hour of being detected), performing fileless attacks are examples of such anti-detection techniques used by these actors.”Paul Prudhomme, head of threat intelligence advisory at IntSights, told The Daily Swig that North Korean attackers were making a greater effort to fly under the radar.Hiding in the shadows: North Korean APT groups are among the most advanced in the world“North Korean attacks have evolved since the beginning of diplomatic reconciliation with the US in 2018,” Prudhomme explained.“Previous North Korean attacks were often disruptive and ‘noisy’ in ways obvious to victims and the general public, such as the 2014 destructive malware attack on Sony Pictures and the worldwide WannaCry ransomware campaign in 2017.“Since the beginning of reconciliation with the US in 2018, North Korean attacks in general have become more subtle and less obvious or ‘noisy’, suggesting greater efforts to avoid detection and attribution,” Prudhomme added.But Mandiant’s Plan disagreed with this assessment.“North Korean operators have significantly improved their TTPs [tactics, techniques, and procedures] over time, especially compared to their earliest identified incidents,” he said. “However, North Korean operations tend to demonstrate poor OPSEC and don’t put much focus on remaining undetected.”How are North Korean threat actors organized?North Korean cyber-threat actors differ significantly from those of other countries in that any malicious cyber operations are almost certainly explicitly allowed or even directed by the government.Mandiant’s Plan commented: “The regime maintains tight control over any internet access in the country, so any cyber operators are probably those selected from North Korea’s military and/or its technical universities. This includes those individuals who are sent overseas to carry out campaigns on behalf of the North Korean government.”Christos Betsios, cyber operations officer at Obrela Security Industries, commented: “What is interesting about how North Korea builds their hacking teams is their recruitment process, as they select their next-generation of hackers from the age of 11, offering them various benefits such as spacious apartments and exemptions from the mandatory military service.”North Korean groups tend to share code, infrastructure, and even complete malware tools with each other – a factor that complicates the classification of individual groups.Morgan Wright, SentinelOne chief security advisor and a former US State Department special advisor, said: “North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau is the primary arm of their intelligence apparatus that focuses on hostile cyber activity.Catch up on the latest cyber warfare news“Through their proxy, the Lazarus Group, the Bureau is heavily focused on mitigating the impact of economic sanctions through theft and supporting their development of nuclear weapons. This includes cryptocurrency (KuCoin for US$275m), banks (Bangladesh Central Bank for US$81m), and ransomware (WannaCry and VHD).”In December 2020, the US Department of Justice filed an indictment against three North Korean hackers for stealing $1.3 billion in cash and cryptocurrency. “This particular activity has become widespread for North Korea and has allowed them to help neutralise the economic impact of sanctions and continue financing their military and governmental objectives,” according to Tyler Baker, threat intelligence manager at Bitdefender.North Korean operators are also reportedly responsible for raising money for their own expenses in addition to bringing in funds for the benefit of the regime.Some security vendors track financially motivated activity under the moniker ‘Bluenoroff’, and attacks targeting South Korean organizations under ‘Andariel’, while others have ascribed cyber-espionage activity to ‘APT37’ and ‘APT38’ groups.“Regardless of their names, reporting into the insights of the Korean's People’s Army of the DPRK have connected Lazarus Group, Bluenoroff, and Andariel to the DPRK’s cyber-warfare guidance unit ‘Bureau 121’,” according to Xueyin Peh, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows.What organizations are North Korean attackers targeting?North Korean cyber operations are most strongly focused on South Korea and the US, and typically target government offices, diplomatic organizations, the military, financial institutions, industrial conglomerates, and most recently, pharmaceuticals and healthcare research.Meanwhile, financially motivated North Korean cybercrime is more global in nature and includes direct targeting of banks, cryptocurrency-focused campaigns, and even web-skimming operations, according to Mandiant.RELATED Prominent cybersecurity researchers among those targeted in North Korean hacking campaignYana Blachman, a former Israeli intelligence operative turned threat intelligence specialist at Venafi, told The Daily Swig that North Korean APT groups collectively target an enormous range of sectors.However, “each APT group is designed to target one specific sector,” Blachman explained. “For instance, Lazarus primarily focuses on the South Korean and US governments and financial organisations in those countries, whereas Bureau 325 is known to target major biotechnology companies, research institutions, and government bodies.“Alongside these groups, others such as APT38 focus primarily on banks, financial institutions, and cryptocurrency exchanges,” Blachman added.Recently, the Lazarus Group performed a highly sophisticated targeted spear phishing campaign in which the attackers spent almost a year before the attack creating security blogs and Twitter accounts and generally interacting with security researchers in attempts to gain their trust.North Korean groups also have a tendency to shift targeting abruptly (most likely in response to sudden edicts from Pyongyang).In mid 2020, for instance, there was a reorientation towards targeting biotech companies and universities involved in Covid-19 research despite little prior activity of this kind.“We identified similar shifts in 2015 as North Korean actors began carrying out financially-motivated cybercrime campaigns, in 2016 again as this expanded to targeting banks directly via long-term intrusions, and so on,” Mandiant’s Plan concluded.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/beyond-lazarus-north-korean-cyber-threat-groups-become-top-tier-reckless-adversaries,"['Cyber', 'Warfare', 'North', 'Korea', 'Analysis', 'China', 'Russia', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'Finance', 'Network', 'Security', 'Malware', 'Encryption', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Phishing', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Coronavirus', 'Government', 'Industry', 'News', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Privacy', 'Ransomware', 'Microsoft', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Surveillance', 'Censorship', 'OSINT', 'OpSec', 'Fraud', 'Legal', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'US', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'Telecommunications']"
no,UK government to review country's aging Computer Misuse Act – official,"Security legislation, ransomware, and supply chain attacks top the agenda at this year’s CyberUK","UK Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced plans to review the country’s aging computer crime laws this year.The review, announced during a ministerial address to the NCSC-organised CyberUK 2021 conference today (May 11), follows a long-running security industry campaign to persuade the government to review the law, spearheaded by the CyberUP initiative.BACKGROUND UK Computer Misuse Act: Lord Chris Holmes CBE on the CyberUp campaign’s call to overhaul ‘archaic’ legislation“The Computer Misuse Act has proved to be an effective piece of legislation to tackle unauthorized access to computer systems, and it has been updated a number of times,” Patel said in a pre-recorded statement to CyberUK delegates.“Alongside the Act there is also separate legislation that provides the powers for law enforcement agencies to investigate both cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes.“As part of ensuring that we have the right tools and mechanisms to detect, disrupt, and deter our adversaries, I believe now is the right time to undertake a formal review of Computer Misuse Act.”Patel said that the government would be holding a consultation of the Computer Misuse Act this year but without giving a firm date or timescale.Long overdueThe CyberUp Campaign, which is backed by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and tech industry trade body techUK, nonetheless described the planned consultation as a ""long overdue step"".The Government’s review will ask academia, business, law enforcement agencies, the cybersecurity industry, and other interested parties about the Act, including whether current “protections in the CMA for legitimate cybersecurity activity provide adequate cover”.Research conducted by the CyberUp Campaign and techUK has found that the vast majority of cybersecurity professionals (80%) worry about breaking the current law in the process of defending against cyber-attacks.Ollie Whitehouse, CTO of NCC Group and spokesperson for the CyberUp Campaign, commented: “We welcome the Home Secretary’s announcement that the government has heeded our calls for a review into the Computer Misuse Act – this is a long overdue step for a piece of legislation that simply hasn’t kept pace with changes in technology.""CyberUK keynoteDuring her speech, Patel warned of the threats posed by state-sponsored attackers, such as those behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack, and ransomware, among other threats.The UK Home Secretary condemned the payment of ransoms to cybercriminals, arguing that paying ransoms does little to guarantee a successful outcome, nor does it protect networks against future attacks or defend against data leaks.“Paying a ransom is likely to encourage criminality [sic] to continue to use this approach,” Patel warned.RELATED Ransomware: Nearly a fifth of victims who pay off extortionists fail to get their data backThe Home Secretary urged organizations to be prepared and to liaise with law enforcement and government organizations such as the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).Protecting the software supply chainEarlier during CyberUK 2021, which took place online this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Sudhakar Ramakrishna, CEO of SolarWinds, spoke to Paul Chichester, NCSC director of operations, about lessons learned from the recent high-impact supply chain attack.SolarWinds has adopted a secure-by-design approach in response to the incident, Ramakrishna said. This involves implementing measures such as least-privilege access and improved technical controls.Chichester praised the move but asked what the incentive might be for more organizations to adopt worthwhile but costly secure-by-design programmes. Ramakrishna admitted this was still a work in progress.Catch up on the latest UK security newsReflecting on this aspect of a larger discussion between Chichester and Ramakrishna, Dr Ian Levy, the NCSC’s technical director, noted that supply chain attacks have been known about since the Sendmail attack of 2002.The danger posed by such incidents was illustrated by the NotPetya ransomware assault of 2017, which relied on a compromised update to a Ukrainian tax accounting package called ‘MeDoc’.Adopting best practices in areas such as secure development can guard against such attacks, but the market provides no economic incentives for such measures, according to Dr Levy.“We don’t buy software because someone has secured their CI/CD [continuous integration/continuous delivery] pipeline,” Dr Levy quipped.RELATED The UK’s Computer Misuse Act is ‘crying out for reform’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/uk-government-to-review-countrys-aging-computer-misuse-act-official,"['UK', 'Government', 'NCSC', 'Cybercrime', 'Ransomware', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Industry', 'News', 'Europe', 'Legal', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Malware', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Events', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Research', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Vulnerabilities']"

There is no evidence that other university systems were impacted.“We have decommissioned FTA, and are in the process of transitioning to a new file transfer system with enhanced security controls, deploying additional system monitoring broadly throughout our network, conducting a security health check of certain systems, and enhancing security controls, processes, and procedures.“We are also reviewing and updating our security policies, procedures and controls as appropriate.”READ MORE UC Berkeley confirms data breach, becomes latest victim of Accellion cyber-attack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/university-of-california-data-breach-sensitive-information-of-staff-students-leaked,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Education', 'Cyber-attacks', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Cybercrime', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Privacy']"
no,What’s TsuNAME? DDoS attack vector threatens authoritative DNS servers,Researchers release open source tool to narrow down cyclic dependencies-related threat,"Computer scientists have uncovered a flaw in some DNS resolvers that, left unresolved, might be abused to launch DDoS attacks against authoritative DNS servers.The vulnerability – dubbed TsuNAME – has the potential to impair a core internet service, rendering at least portions of the net difficult to reach in the process.“TsuNAME occurs when domain names are misconfigured with cyclic dependent DNS records, and when vulnerable resolvers access these misconfigurations, they begin looping and send DNS queries rapidly to authoritative servers and other resolvers,” the researchers explain in a paper (PDF) on the vulnerability.Catch up on the latest DNS-related security newsUsing real production data, the four researchers – Giovane Moura of SIDN Labs, Sebastian Castro and John Heidemann from InternetNZ, and Wes Hardaker of USC/ISI – showed how just two misconfigured domains led to a 50% increase on overall traffic volume for .nz’s authoritative servers.Defending against TsuNAME requires changes to some recursive resolver software, by including loop detection codes and caching cyclic-dependent records.Cycle of repairThe team have developed CycleHunter, an open-source tool that allows for authoritative DNS server operators to detect cyclic dependencies and therefore see exactly which systems need security remediation work to defend against potential attack.Performing an analysis of 184 million domain names in seven large, top-level domains (TLDs), the researchers used to tool to find 44 cyclic-dependent NS records (likely from configuration errors) used by 1,400 domain names.The team is working with resolver developers and many TLD operators to protect DNS systems against potential attack. Google Public DNS and Cisco OpenDNS have already been updated.Cricket Liu, chief DNS architect at Infoblox, told The Daily Swig that while “TsuNAME is certainly serious” the community has “discovered and dealt with issues like this before.“DNS servers already have mechanisms in place to protect themselves from *some* of these configurations, such as looping aliases, and adding a new mechanism to detect and cope with this one probably won't be difficult,” Liu explained.Work to address TSuNAME is already well in hand, he added.Liu said: “The paper says that OpenDNS and Google Public DNS have already fixed the problem. In addition, the most important DNS servers to patch are the Internet’s big open recursive DNS servers (such an Google Public DNS and Cloudflare), since those could be used by a bad guy to initiate a DDoS attack, and there aren't very many of those.”Weapons gradeThe researchers warn that a “well motivated adversary could easily weaponize this vulnerability” but Liu expressed scepticism on this point.“I also think weaponizing TsuNAME seems somewhat difficult,” Liu told The Daily Swig. “The authors talk about setting up the problematic circular delegations, but they need to control the zones ‘on both sides’ to set them up. To attack some example.org, delegated to example.com, they'd need to control example.com.”The Daily Swig asked both the researchers follow-up questions about the TsuNAME vulnerability.

no,Pega Infinity hotfix released after researchers flag critical authentication bypass vulnerability,Flawed password reset system opened the door to full account takeover,"UPDATED Users of the Pega Infinity enterprise software platform are being advised to update their installations after a vulnerability was discovered by security researchers.According to the research team – Sam Curry, Justin Rhinehart, Brett Buerhaus, and Maik Robert – CVE-2021-27651 is a critical-risk vulnerability in versions 8.2.1 to 8.5.2 of Pega’s Infinity software.The proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker could bypass Pega Infinity’s password reset system.Assailants could then use the reset account to “fully compromise” the Pega instance, through administrator-only remote code execution. This could include modifying dynamic pages, or templating.The researchers worked with developer Pegasystems to develop a hot fix for the software.The vendor recommends that customers running the software on-premises should check if their version is affected and apply the relevant hot fix.Enterprise software pwnagePega Infinity is a popular enterprise software suite, with over 2,000 users. The package includes customer service and sales automation, an AI-driven ‘customer decision hub’, workforce intelligence, and a ‘no-code’ development platform.The security researchers came across the Pega Infinity vulnerability through participation in Apple’s bug bounty program.RECOMMENDED Remote Mouse mobile app contains raft of zero-day RCE vulnerabilities“We’d been hacking on Apple's bug bounty program for about six months and had spent a lot of time on software produced by Apple themselves,” UK-based hacker Sam Curry told The Daily Swig.“We had decided to switch routes and target vendors [supplying technology to Apple] instead after reading a blog post from two awesome researchers.”Curry has previously documented his experiences with Apple’s bug bounty program.Behind the bugThe researchers used Burp Suite to discover the password reset weakness in Pega Infinity.This allows a full compromise of any Pega instance with “no prerequisite knowledge”, according to Curry.In addition, Justin Rhinehart developed a Nuclei template to determine whether software is running Pega Infinity.Read more of the latest security research news“These systems are largely public facing and aren’t necessarily designed to be run internally, so at the time of reporting there was a large number of affected customers running Pega Infinity externally,” Curry explained.“Pega's customers are from every sector and at the time of reporting some of the customers included the FBI, US Air Force, Apple, American Express, and a few other huge names.”Curry says that Pega was quick to work with the researchers to patch the vulnerability, even though they needed time for customers running Infinity on-premises to update their installations. This process, Curry said, took over three months.Responding to questions from The Daily Swig, Pegasystems said: “We have worked with the researchers under our responsible disclosure process to develop a fix, advise clients to apply it, and issue CVE (2021-27651) on April 29, 2021.”The vendor added: “We would like to also note that no clients have reported any issues related to this vulnerability. Pega makes security a top priority, and we have acted quickly to remedy this issue.“Pega believes independent security researchers play a valuable role in internet security, and we encourage responsible reporting of any vulnerabilities that may be found on our site or in our applications.”This article has been updated to include comment from Pegasystems.DON’T FORGET TO READ What the FLoC?

no,Four plead guilty to providing ‘bulletproof’ hosting services for cybercriminals,Eastern European nationals admit to renting out resources to launch malware attacks and conduct other fraudulent activities,"Four people have pleaded guilty to providing ‘bulletproof’ hosting services used by cybercriminals to distribute malware and launch other cyber-attacks.The individuals – Aleksandr Grichishkin, 34, and Andrei Skvortsov, 34, of Russia; Aleksandr Skorodumov, 33, of Lithuania; and Pavel Stassi, 30, of Estonia – maintained the services from 2008 to 2015, according to the US Department of Justice (DoJ).In a statement issued on Friday (May 7), the DoJ detailed how the group allegedly rented out IP addresses, servers, and domains to cybercriminals enabling them to launch malware attacks, gain access to victims’ computers, form botnets, and steal banking credentials for use in frauds across the US.Read more of the latest cybercrime newsMalware hosted by the organization included Zeus, SpyEye, Citadel, and the Blackhole Exploit Kit, claims the DoJ, which “rampantly attacked” US-based companies and financial institutions between 2009 and 2015.The DoJ also stated that the defendants helped criminals to evade detection by monitoring sites used to blocklist technical infrastructure used for crime, moving “flagged” content to new infrastructure, and registering all such infrastructure under false or stolen identities.Stassi, Skorodumov, Skvortsov, and Grichishkin all pleaded guilty to one count of Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization (RICO) conspiracy.All four defendants face a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.Held to accountActing assistant attorney general Nicholas McQuaid, of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, commented: “The criminal organizations that purposefully aid these actors – the so-called bulletproof hosters, money launderers, purveyors of stolen identity information, and the like – are no less responsible for the harms these malware campaigns cause, and we are committed to holding them accountable.“Prosecutions like this one increase the costs and risks to cybercriminals and ensure that they cannot evade responsibility for the enormous injuries they cause to victims.”Safe havenSo-called bulletproof hosting services are known as a “safe haven” for criminal hackers since they can make it easier for malicious actors to conceal their wrongdoings and minimize the downtime of their cybercrime campaigns.In recent years, authorities have looked to crack down on these operations which, among other services, provide illegal VPN networks.The internet industry group i2Coalition also threw its weight behind a clampdown on illegal VPNs, calling for providers to adhere to a minimum standard of ethics.READ MORE Safe-Inet: VPN service for cybercriminals taken down in law enforcement bust",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/four-plead-guilty-to-providing-bulletproof-hosting-services-for-cybercriminals,"['Cybercrime', 'Malware', 'Hacking', 'News', 'US', 'Legal', 'VPN', 'North', 'America', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Fraud', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Government', 'DDoS', 'Finance', 'Network', 'Security', 'Ransomware']"
no,Remote Mouse mobile app contains raft of zero-day RCE vulnerabilities,"Remote control app for desktop PCs has surpassed 20m users, says vendor","Six zero-day vulnerabilities in Remote Mouse, a hugely popular app that turns tablets and smartphones into remote controllers for desktop PCs, could potentially lead to zero-click remote code execution (RCE).Collectively dubbed ‘MouseTrap’, the security flaws arise from the use of authentication with a password hash that can be intercepted and looked up in a rainbow table, and the absence of encryption and cryptographic nonces in communications, according to a blog post published by security researcher Axel Persinger on May 5.‘Complete takeover’Remote Mouse simulates the functions of a mouse, keyboard, and touchpad on Windows, macOS, and Linux machines, and is compatible with iOS, Android, and Windows mobile devices.The app’s developer, Emote Interactive, claims it has been used by more than 20 million users worldwide.During his research, Persinger found that the absence of a nonce in User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets sent from devices to desktop PCs means attackers can “freely inject keystrokes” with no user interaction.Exploitation of the vulnerabilities in the application protocol can potentially “result in the complete takeover of someone’s machine, if they’re running the software. And the exploit would run at the privilege level of the user”, the researcher told The Daily Swig.“There are a lot of oblivious users who could be completely owned without ever realizing,” said Persinger.Alerting the vendorThe researcher says he found the flaws in Remote Mouse version 3.015, and that they were still present in version 4.0.0.0, which has been released since he alerted the vendor.As of today (May 10), he told The Daily Swig that Emote Interactive, which appears to be based in Hong Kong, had still not replied to his email alerting them to the vulnerabilities on February 6.The Daily Swig also sent queries to Emote Interactive on May 7 and we’ve yet to receive a reply. We will update this article should there be any further developments.Calamitous keystrokesThe flaws, which are yet to be assigned CVSS scores, mean attackers can exploit the absence of authentication logic and the fact that information is sent in cleartext to “maximize or minimize the window of a running process by sending the process name in a crafted packet” (CVE-2021-27569).According to the researcher, an attacker would also be able to “close any running process by sending the process name in a specially crafted packet” (CVE-2021-27570), and “retrieve recently used and running applications, their icons, and their file paths” (CVE-2021-27571).Read more of the latest cybersecurity vulnerability newsAnother two flaws allow unauthenticated users to “execute arbitrary code via crafted UDP packets” – one through an authentication bypass via packet replay (CVE-2021-27572), and another “with no prior authorization or authentication” (CVE-2021-27573).Finally, the use of “cleartext HTTP to check, and request, updates” means “attackers can machine-in-the-middle a victim to download a malicious binary in place of the real update, with no SSL errors or warnings” (CVE-2021-27574).“Once you realize how keystrokes and mouse movements are passed from the mobile app to the computer, I think it becomes pretty straightforward to exploit” these vulnerabilities, says Persinger.Warning the app storesIn lieu of a response from the vendor, Persinger contacted Microsoft, Apple, and Google “to see if they would remove the application” from their respective mobile app stores, but none had replied at the time of press.He also says that, based on advice gleaned from other infosec experts, next time a vulnerability report fails to elicit a vendor response he would “email a few different addresses at the 90 day, 60 day, and 30 day marks”.“The reason I’m doing this work is to protect end users’ security, and the last thing I want to do is hurt that,” he said.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/remote-mouse-mobile-app-contains-raft-of-zero-day-rce-vulnerabilities,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'RCE', 'Mobile', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Asia', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'MitM', 'Research', 'Authentication', 'IoT', 'Passwords', 'Privacy', 'Gaming', 'Google', 'Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Windows', 'Linux']"
no,What the FLoC? Everything you need to know about Google’s new ad tech that aims to replace third-party cookies,Will ‘Federated Learning of Cohorts’ preserve user privacy? The jury is still out,"Over the years, web developers have dreamed up dozens of cute error pages to remind visitors to switch on cookies in their browsers.Most are riffs on the eponymous baked snack (“Will work for cookies”) or Sesame Street’s Cookie Monster.But the Cookie Monster may soon have fewer job opportunities – at least, that’s if Google gets its way. The internet giant plans to replace at least part of the cookie ecosystem with its own technology. And these changes could have a far-reaching impact on security and privacy on the web.The cookie crumblesIn 2020, Google announced that it would phase out support in Chrome for ‘third-party’ cookies, which are used by advertisers, and others, to track users as they move across the internet.According to Gareth Haken, an analyst at the Information Security Forum (ISF), third-party cookies are favored by the large social media companies and are often placed on sites via social media buttons. But, he says, the tide has been turning against third-party cookies for some time.Catch up on the latest data privacy news and breachesSafari and Firefox blocked the technology some time ago, so Google is playing catch-up.“This will speed up the death of third-party cookies, especially with Chrome banning them… but this will affect only those looking to track users around the internet, such as advertisers,” Haken told The Daily Swig.What will not change is the way websites use their own cookies. Cookie technology is here to stay, with Google – and others – maintaining that first-party cookies are essential to the smooth running of the internet. “First party cookies are really useful. For instance, they mean you don’t have to log in each time you navigate to a new page on a website,” Haken explains. “It is third-party cookies that are more contentious.”Google joins the FLoCUnlike Apple and Firefox developer Mozilla – and unsurprisingly given its dependence on advertising revenues – Google is not doing away with tracking altogether. Instead, it aims to replace third-party cookies with its own technology: FLoC.The system is part of Google’s wider Privacy Sandbox initiative.FLoC – or ‘Federated Learning of Cohorts’ – allows advertisers to track internet users without revealing their identity. Instead, users will be placed within cohorts, according to their interests.Internet privacy watchers say it is not yet clear exactly how this will work, although it is understood that browser history will play a part. All information will, though, be processed client side.Google FLoC allows advertisers to track internet users without the need for cookiesAccording to a paper provided by Google to The Daily Swig, “federated learning simply means using machine learning and analytics without collecting and storing any raw data away from users’ devices.“The main advantage of federated learning is that it enables product improvements and privacy without requiring sensitive data to be uploaded to datacenters. Instead machine learning models run on users’ devices and only the results of the computation are securely uploaded to servers.“This also helps protect against potential risks relating to centralised data collection like theft and misuse of many users’ data at once.” (Google declined to comment further.)Advertisers will be able to target ads at these interest-based groups. And, as the system combines cohorts, Google should be able to offer more granular targeting.But it is the intersection between cohorts that raises worries among privacy advocates.FLoC, and privacy red flagsRemoving the need to store web users’ information on servers should boost privacy. And Google argues strongly that FLoC offers stronger privacy controls than third-party cookies, or alternatives such as browser fingerprinting.Google describes FloC as a “privacy-preserving API”, in part because advertisers only have access to the cohort ID, not the identity of individual users.But as cohorts shrink – or in advertiser speak, become more targeted – the risk of inadvertent identification grows.“If I am a trader specialising in performance motorbikes anybody visiting my site will be placed into a cohort based partly on their interest in performance motorcycles,” explains the ISF’s Haken.“If we say 1,000 people visit my site in one month and 500 of those people also visit a football website, they would in theory become part of the football liking motorcycle enthusiast cohort. If 300 of this cohort also visit sites concerning craft ale a new cohort would be formed and so on.”DON’T FORGET TO READ Raising the bar: Tiki app aims to hand data ownership back to the individualThe privacy risk would become greater still if cohorts are created based on small geographical areas, or other links, such as to an employer. If just one craft ale-drinking biker worked for a particular employer, it might be possible to identify him or her.Some interests will be kept out of cohorts – adult sites and medical information will not be tracked, for instance. But, Haken says, these interests are grouped together as ‘sensitive’ by FLoC; the system might not be able to distinguish between a history of viewing adult material from researching, say, Covid-19 symptoms.Potentially, a website owner with access to their customers’ personal identifiable information could use that data to associate cohorts with individuals, Haken warns.As yet, it’s not clear exactly how FLoC’s cohorts will work in practice, but Google staff have admitted that the system will not be trialed in the EU, over concerns that it breaches parts of the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.Instead, FLoC is being tested in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, and the US.Privacy groups have urged caution over the rollout of FLoC To the barricades: Why is FloC being met with resistance?Support for FloC outside Google appears to be limited.Privacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), for instance, describes the technology as “a terrible idea”.The maintainers of WordPress, the most widely used content management system (CMS), are suggesting that FLoC should be treated as a security issue, while developers working with Drupal, another popular CMS platform, have similar concerns.“So far, no major browsers besides Google Chrome are planning to include an implementation of FLoC, Joshua Long, chief security analyst at Intego, told The Daily Swig.“Mozilla, the developer of Firefox, has explicitly stated that it has ‘no current plans to implement [FLoC] at this time’.”Developers of other Chromium-based browsers, including Brave and Vivaldi, are even stronger in their opposition, even though they share much of the same codebase as Google Chrome.RECOMMENDED Google Android’s implementation of privacy-preserving contact tracing ‘flawed’ As of last year, the most-used Chromium-based browser is Microsoft’s Edge.If Microsoft opts not to support FLoC – and the company is working on its own alternative proposal, Parakeet – the system could struggle to gain traction.There is also skepticism about Google’s motives.“What I’ve been saying all along, whether it is FLoC or [other] alternatives to cookies, is who stands to make money here,” Cory Munchbach, a privacy advocate and former industry analyst, and now chief operating officer at customer data platform BlueConic, told The Daily Swig.“That is why you can insert a layer of skepticism about this proposal. FLoC benefits Google and consolidates their influence under the guise of privacy.”Most privacy and security experts do concede, however, that FLoC is preferable to the status quo.Blocking FLoCWhether many internet users will worry about FLoC will depend largely on their perception of targeted advertising and sharing data.Without revenues from targeted advertising, some web companies would no doubt struggle, although publishers will, of course, still be able to use first-party cookies.“We are heading to the point where we need to have a conversation about why we say the internet is free,” says Munchbach. “It’s never been free!”.Many internet users will no doubt continue to willingly trade privacy for free access to content.For the rest, blocking FLoC is relatively easy. “The easiest way to avoid FLoC is to use literally any browser other than Google Chrome,” says Intego’s Long. And even Chrome users can block the technology by blocking third-party cookies in the browser settings.Web developers can opt out of FLoC too. Mainstream web applications are unlikely to be impacted directly, as they use first party, rather than third party, cookies.An uncertain future for web trackingThe main impact of replacing third-party cookies with FLoC will be on advertisers. To continue tracking, they may have to get on board with FLoC, or accept that advertising can no longer be so finely targeted.Intego’s Long suspects a cynical motive behind FLoC.“The whole idea seems to be that, since a lot of people block third-party cookies anyway, Google needed an excuse to develop a new tracking technology that they claim is better than cookies,” he says. “Google is well known as a company that makes the majority of its revenue from ads and tracking. The fact that everyone else in the industry seems to be saying ‘no’ to FLoC is quite telling.”Back in the late 1800s, the US retailer John Wanamaker is reported to have said: “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half”.If privacy proponents get their way, that could eventually become true again for online advertisers.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/what-the-floc-everything-you-need-to-know-about-googles-new-ad-tech-that-aims-to-replace-third-party-cookies,"['Google', 'Privacy', 'Browsers', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Analysis', 'Chrome', 'Social', 'Media', 'Mozilla', 'firefox', 'Surveillance', 'OpSec', 'Apple', 'Safari', 'Edge', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'AI']"

Twitter, meanwhile, needs to educate users of the tipping service about what info tip receivers get when using PayPal.Read more of the latest data privacy newsIn response, Twitter acted promptly to offer a revision of its wording so that it’s clear Tip Jar donations made through PayPal are not anonymous.“We’re updating our tipping prompt and Help Center to make it clearer that other apps may share info between people sending/receiving tips, per their terms,” a message from the official Twitter Support account explained.The Daily Swig asked Tobac if she’d had any feedback from PayPal, as well as whether other Tip Jar payment options might offer better privacy controls.""I have not yet seen a way that folks can use Twitter tip jar anonymously,"" Tobac responded. ""Twitter does warn Tip Jar users that it may reveal their real name (and now we know in some cases it can reveal more than a real name).""Tobac’s insight sparked a lively debate among security researchers with several, including Brian Krebs and Marcus Hutchins, noting how fraudulent donations made using stolen credit cards could be used to leave recipients out of pocket through chargeback fees.This story was updated to add comment from Rachel TobacRECOMMEND Mauritian government’s plan to intercept encrypted web traffic marks ‘death knell for freedom of speech’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researcher-calls-out-privacy-flaw-in-twitters-new-tip-jar-donation-feature,"['Privacy', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Social', 'Media', 'E-Commerce', 'Industry', 'News', 'Finance', 'Fraud', 'OpSec', 'OSINT', 'Research']"

yes,"Researcher discovers vulnerabilities in Azure Functions, stumbles across false oracle",Potential catastrophe averted due to an implementation bug in Microsoft cryptography,"Two vulnerabilities discovered in Microsoft Azure Functions have been disclosed, although severity of one of the flaws was mitigated by a separate implementation bug.Last week, researcher Paul “Polarply” described the vulnerabilities, privately reported to Microsoft in late 2020, in a technical blog post last week.Catch up on the latest cloud security newsThe security flaws were found in Azure Functions, an on-demand cloud service designed for managing applications and message queues, responding to database changes, and building web-based APIs.According to the researcher, the first vulnerability is a privilege escalation bug in Linux Azure Function instances found in the SCM_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE environment variable.While the URL redirects to an Azure Function package, its SAS token had a ‘write’ permission, allowing attackers with code execution privilege over a Function to overwrite the package, tampering with user levels and potentially permitting an attacker to “plant a backdoor which would have run in every Function invocation”.The second vulnerability was found through the extraction of a SAS token from a URL linked a storage blob belonging to Microsoft, connected to Azure Function, by querying azcontainers blob storage.This allowed encrypted Function configurations that do not belong to the user to be viewed. However, as they are encrypted, the researcher says the downloading of these configurations, while possible, “had no practical impact”.Consult the oracleIn addition, the researcher found a padding oracle available as an undocumented HTTP endpoint on Function instances. Initially, he believed this could have allowed remote code execution (RCE) to be achieved over arbitrary Azure Functions, as well as the decryption of configurations.However, further examination revealed cryptographic dysfunction in the oracle caused by Microsoft’s cryptography codebase – rendering the oracle useless for an RCE attack.“The attack still required matching the oracle (the Function URL) to its configuration which probably would have limited the impact of the attack should I have been successful,” the researcher noted.RECOMMENDED Time to update DNS servers to defend against brace of serious BIND vulnerabilitiesSpeaking to The Daily Swig, Polarply emphasized that the padding bug had no real-world implications due to the issues in the cryptographic code. However, the function overwrite issue was still “pretty serious”.“It meant any attacker who had code execution on the Function could overwrite its code and install a backdoor [and] the victims wouldn't even know it’s there,” he told us.To resolve the flaws, the scope of the SAS tokens were changed so apps could not read encrypted configurations which do not belong to them. Token restrictions were also enabled.However, as the oracle was inoperative, no changes were made.A spokesperson for Microsoft said that a fix was issued in November 2020, and customers do not need to take any action to stay protected.The tech giant did not provide a bug bounty for the vulnerability report.RELATED H2C smuggling proves effective against Azure, Cloudflare Access, and more",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researcher-discovers-vulnerabilities-in-azure-functions-stumbles-across-false-oracle,"['Cloud', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Microsoft', 'Encryption', 'Linux', 'Network', 'Security', 'RCE', 'Secure', 'Development', 'API', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps']"
no,Mauritian government’s plan to intercept encrypted web traffic marks ‘death knell for freedom of speech’,Privacy and security advocates slam proposal that would allow authorities to ‘inspect’ all social media traffic,"The Mauritian government is considering plans to monitor and censor social media by intercepting web traffic.In a consultation document (PDF), the country’s Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA) calls for “harmful and illegal contents” to be removed.To achieve this, it says, “It is important to segregate… all incoming and outgoing internet traffic in Mauritius, social media traffic, which will then need to be decrypted, re-encrypted and archived for inspection purposes as and when required.”Read more of the latest data privacy newsWhile freedom of speech is guaranteed under Mauritius’s constitution, the government has already introduced an amendment to the ICT Act, imposing prison sentences of up to 10 years for online messages that “inconvenience” the reader. In practice, this amendment has been used to file complaints against journalists and media outlets.Now, in the consultation document, the ICTA claims it needs to take further measures thanks to “unacceptable abuses by a minority of individuals or organized groups”.Censorship fearsThe Mauritian telecommunications regulator says it’s particularly concerned about ""objectionable"" Creole-language content which, it says, is taken down too slowly by social media companies.And, says the ICTA, the lack of any local offices for social media firms makes it difficult to apply pressure on them to remove content as other nations can. Instead, it is turning to technical measures – a move that prompted stark warnings from security and privacy advocates.“Unfortunately, the ability of Mauritius to block, turn off, or implement some form of internet censoring is very feasible,” Erick Thek, dedicated intelligence research manager at Trend Micro tells The Daily Swig.“Mauritius nationalized both fiber optic backbones and these backbones are connected to the four undersea cables connecting Mauritius to the rest of the world.”LONG READS Behind the Great Firewall: Chinese cyber-espionage adapts to post-Covid worldThe move to allow authorities the ability to snoop on encrypted web traffic also creates potential security risks for citizens.“To make this work, everyone will have to add a new Certificate Authority to their computers, so that they aren’t alerted to a manipulator-in-the-middle attack when their communications are intercepted,” the Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence team told The Daily Swig.“By asking everyone to download something – a certificate – that isn’t widely understood, this proposal kicks the door open for copycat scammers proffering malware, running phishing scams with government branding, or offering their own certificates and running their own MitM attacks.”Mauritius: Sun, sea, and censorshipDangerous gamesUnsurprisingly, the proposal has prompted strong opposition from those fearing further government surveillance on the part of the Mauritian government.In a recent blog post, Jillian York and David Greene of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), wrote:Authorities wish to install a local/proxy server that impersonates social media networks to fool devices and web browsers into sending secure information to the local server instead of social media networks, effectively creating an archive of the social media information of all users in Mauritius before resending it to the social media networks’ servers.This plan fails to mention how long the information will be archived, or how user data will be protected from data breaches.Meanwhile, a petition calling for the proposals to be scrapped, launched by Anglo-Mauritian writer Ariel Saramandi, has reached around 22,000 signatures.“This is a country that has arrested journalists, that arrests citizens for posting memes making fun of the prime minister, that already has a dangerous, absurd law in the ICT Act,” she tells The Daily Swig.“The proposal, if put into place, would give authorities a tool of incredible magnitude in their hands, which would enable them to silence government critics.

no,US Department of Defense expands vulnerability disclosure program,"DoD networks, IoT devices, and industrial control systems now in play","The US Department of Defense (DoD) has expanded its security vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) beyond its public-facing websites and web applications to encompass all publicly accessible information systems.That brings into scope all public-facing DoD networks, frequency-based communication platforms, IoT devices, and industrial control systems, among other technologies, the DoD announced yesterday (May 4).“This expansion is a testament to transforming the government’s approach to security and leapfrogging the current state of technology within” the DoD, said Brett Goldstein, director of the Defense Digital Service, which is tasked with improving technology in use across the DoD.Catch up on the latest bug bounty newsBug hunters have submitted more than 29,000 security vulnerability reports to the VDP – 70% of which were deemed valid – since its 2016 launch on HackerOne.Kristopher Johnson, director of the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3), which oversees the DoD VDP, expects this number to expand along with the in-scope attack surface, an expansion he says the DoD has long envisaged.“The department has always maintained the perspective that DoD websites were only the beginning as they account for a fraction of our overall attack surface,” he said.The US operations center for Exercise Locked Shields 2021, the 30-nation cyber defense exercise‘Huge news’Responding on Twitter, Jack Cable, who works as a hacker at the Defense Digital Service, hailed the development as “huge news. First vulnerability disclosure policy I'm aware of that goes beyond web systems to anything publicly accessible such as ‘frequency-based communication, Internet of Things, industrial control systems’”.The DoD’s VDP was born out of its 2016 ‘Hack the Pentagon’ pilot initiative, an invite-only, time-limited bug bounty program that has since spawned equivalent programs for the US Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Defense Travel System.“The DoD Vulnerability Policy launched in 2016 because we demonstrated the efficacy of working with the hacker community and even hiring hackers to find and fix vulnerabilities in systems,” said the DoD’s Goldstein.Before the VDP was in place, the lack of vulnerability reporting mechanisms meant “many vulnerabilities went unreported”, he added.In January, another key US defense agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), reported on the achievements of its Finding Exploits to Thwart Tampering (FETT) program, under which researchers from crowdsourced security platform Synack probed hardware architectures developed under DARPA’s ‘SSITH’ program.The German armed forces (the ‘Bundeswehr’) is among few other militaries worldwide to launch a VDP, while Singapore’s Ministry of Defense has emulated the DoD’s Hack the Pentagon model with its own invite-only HackerOne bug bounty challenges.RECOMMENDED Bug Bounty Radar // The latest bug bounty programs for May 2021",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/us-department-of-defense-expands-vulnerability-disclosure-program,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'VDP', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'IoT', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hardware', 'Organizations', 'Government', 'Maritime']"
no,Multiple critical vulnerabilities in Exim email server software pose RCE risk,Msg spool attack threat,"UPDATED Security researchers at Qualys have uncovered multiple security vulnerabilities in Exim, one of the most popular mail transfer agents.During a full security audit of Exim, the researchers found 21 vulnerabilities. Eleven of the vulnerabilities were only exploitable locally, but the remaining 10 might lend themselves to remote exploitation.Worse yet, several of these remotely exploitable issues could be chained together with local privilege escalation flaws to create a full remote code execution attack, Qualys warns.Digital paper trailThe issues go back to at least the beginning of Exim’s Git history, in 2004, so all supported versions of the software need updating.The vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2020-28007 through CVE-2020-28026, plus CVE-2021-27216.Catch up on the latest vulnerability researchQualys has demonstrated that three of the flaws pose an unauthenticated RCE risk – a severe class of vulnerability that requires no action from the victim and can result in full system takeover.The trio of critical security flaws include CVE-2020-28020, an integer overflow in receive_msg(); CVE-2020-28018, a use-after-free flaw in tls-openssl.c; and CVE-2020-28021, a new-line injection into spool header file.Details of the 21 flaws are covered in a technical blog post by Qualys. A landing page with a walkthrough video has also been released.In response to questions from The Daily Swig , Qualys offered more details on the threat posed by the vulnerabilitiesThere is no need to chain vulnerabilities to achieve RCE. What needs to be chained is one RCE that yields an unprivileged access to the server, and one LPE [local privilege escalation] that transforms that unprivileged access into a privileged one (i.e. root access).For example, we chained CVE-2020-28018 (an unauthenticated RCE) with CVE-2020-28008 (a LPE, Local Privilege Escalation) to obtain full root privileges in our demo video.Server-side mayhemExim mail servers are popular in their category and handle a large volume of internet traffic, making them an attractive target for attackers.RELATED Critical Exim bug impacts more than half of all email serversBharat Jogi, senior manager, vulnerability and threat research at Qualys, commented: “The 21 vulnerabilities we found are critical as attackers can remotely exploit them to gain complete root privileges on an Exim system – allowing compromises such as a remote attacker gaining full root privileges on the target server and executing commands to install programs, modify data, create new accounts, and change sensitive settings on the mail servers.text“It’s imperative that users apply patches immediately,” Jogi concluded.A recent survey by E-Soft found that three in five (60.7 %) of publicly accessible email servers ran Exim, way ahead of its closest rival Postfix. The Exim platform is particularly popular as a mail transfer agent package with universities, for example.On May 17, security researchers released a proof-of-concept exploit for the Exim use-after-free flaw that leads to remote code execution.This story was updated to add comment from Qualys.

no,Google and Mozilla unveil plans to bake HTML sanitization into their browsers,Tech giants take aim at client-side scripting attacks,"Engineers at Google, Mozilla, and security firm Cure53 have come together to develop an application programming interface (API) that provides a systematic solution to HTML sanitization.The API, which will be integrated into future versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers, will enable web developers to sanitize HTML input strings and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks without the need for third-party libraries.Preventing XSS attacksWeb applications are often required to handle dynamic HTML content in the browser, such as when rendering user-generated content or dealing with templates.Client-side HTML processing often causes security holes and malicious actors use them to stage XSS attacks and steal user information or send web commands on users’ behalf.“Historically, the web has been confronted with XSS issues ever since the inception of JavaScript,” Frederik Braun, security engineer at Mozilla, told The Daily Swig.“The web has an increase in browser capabilities with new APIs and can thus be added to the attacker’s toolbox.”Read more of the latest hacking newsIn 2012, Braun was part of another Google/Mozilla effort that led to the development of Content-Security Policy (CSP), a set of HTTP header directives that help mitigate XSS attacks by putting restrictions on how web pages handle different types of content. But CSP has not gained the traction its creators hoped.“We believe that complex systems like CSP are generally really useful and worthy of adoption, but have also seen that it’s mostly used by top websites which are backed by big companies,” Braun said.?Sanitization librariesMany developers rely on open-source JavaScript libraries such as DOMPurify to prevent XSS attacks. DOMPurify takes an HTML string as input and sanitizes it by escaping and removing potentially vulnerable parts.DOMPurify has become a very popular library among front-end JavaScript developers. But keeping the library in sync with changes to web standards and different versions of browsers presents challenges.RELATED DOMPurify mutation XSS bypass achieved through MathML namespace confusion“The issue with parsing HTML is that it is [a] living standard and thus a quickly moving target,” Braun said. “To ensure that the HTML sanitizer works correctly on new input, it needs to keep up with this standard. The failure to do so can be catastrophic and lead to sanitizer bypasses.”The Mozilla engineer added that HTML sanitizers must also solve the challenge of matching the exact parsing behavior of each browser.The new HTML Sanitizer API has been developed by Google, Mozilla, and the wider security communityAttacking from all anglesMicha? Bentkowski, a security researcher with extensive experience of hunting XSS bugs, told The Daily Swig that JavaScript-based sanitizers present other hurdles as well.“They increase the bundle size. I’ve met developers that were skeptical of including a sanitizer because they make their JS code much larger,” Bentkowski said.“The sanitizers also need to deal with certain oddities of JS/DOM. For instance, they need to have some kind of protection against DOM clobbering attacks because they would be easily bypassable otherwise.”‘POSIX’, another web security researcher, raised concern about the fragmented state of sanitization libraries.“Each of the libraries for [XSS mitigation] has been developed separately by different vendors,” he told The Daily Swig. “Even safe libraries can become vulnerable if there’s not continuous maintenance.”Native HTML sanitization?The HTML Sanitizer API bakes XSS mitigation functionality directly into the browser. Developers can instantiate and use the API’s sanitizer class without the need to import external libraries.“This moves the responsibility for correct parsing into a piece of software that is already getting frequent security updates and has proven successful in doing it timely,” Braun said.Browsers already have baked-in sanitizers for clipboard data, Bentkowski says, so reusing the code to expand native sanitization capabilities would make perfect sense.RECOMMENDED Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a ‘post-XSS world’“In general, I believe that it is a right call to implement the sanitizer directly in the browser,” Bentkowski says.“The message to developers that need to make use of a sanitizer is going to be simple: ‘Just use the built-in sanitizer; you don't need to include any external libraries!’ This should also raise awareness about the need for sanitization to average developers.”POSIX added that “we don’t have to take time for thinking about which library to use anymore. And as [HTML Sanitizer API] is dependent on the browser, we can expect it to be managed more carefully than before, like react immediately to changes in browser functionalities”. But the researcher also warned against against putting excessive trust against a single API.Testing the APIAccording to its specification document, the HTML Sanitizer API will not prevent mutated XSS attacks and attacks that exploit server-side vulnerabilities. With extra configuration, however, it can prevent DOM clobbering and XSS attacks based on script gadgets.An experimental implementation of the API has been integrated into Firefox Nightly and Chrome Canary, the test versions of the browsers. A test page for the API is also available online.Braun said that the API is ripe for testing for anyone who wants to critically analyze and test its security properties. But the API methods and the internal behavior are still unstable, therefore developers should not write applications against it yet, he added.“This specification is incubating and thus in W3C’s Web Platform Incubator Community Group (WICG), but I’m personally hopeful it will be adopted by a W3C working group before this year ends,” Braun said.Bentkowski, who has tested the API, said it has some issues but he believes these are “just teething troubles” that will be fixed soon.“I hope that built-in sanitizer will reduce the amount of cross-site scripting issues in applications that deal with WYSIWYG editors or Markdown processing because these seem to be the main beneficiaries of the new standard,” he added.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-and-mozilla-unveil-plans-to-bake-html-sanitization-into-their-browsers,"['Vulnerabilities', 'XSS', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Google', 'Mozilla', 'firefox', 'Chrome', 'Browsers', 'Industry', 'News', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'API', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Privacy', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Analysis', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Mobile', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'JavaScript']"
no,Pulse Connect Secure zero-day stars in critical patch batch,System updates urgent amid exploitation by nation-state attackers,"An actively exploited zero-day vulnerability in Pulse Connect Secure VPN appliances has been patched together with another pair of newly disclosed critical flaws.Organizations that use Connect Secure, described by parent company Ivanti as the most widely used SSL VPN, were urged to update their systems immediately in a security advisory dropped yesterday (May 3).The former zero-day bug, which can lead to remote code execution (RCE) and has a maximum CVSS score of 10, was first disclosed on April 20 along with suggested mitigations. The advice arrived amid reports of widespread, in-the-wild exploitation by suspected state-backed threat actors.The attackers, believed to include a group – ‘UNC2630’ – linked to APT5 and the Chinese government, have also targeted three Connect Secure vulnerabilities patched in 2019 and 2020: CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2020-8243, and CVE-2020-8260.Anatomy of exploitationIvanti CSO Phil Richards said malicious activity had been “identified on a very limited number of customer systems”.In a lengthy technical write-up analyzing the deployment of 12 malware families, FireEye-owned incident response firm Mandiant said intrusions traced back to Pulse Secure flaws had been observed against defense, government, and financial organizations in the US, Europe, and elsewhere.“Multiple, related techniques for bypassing single and multifactor authentication on Pulse Secure VPN devices [were] persisting across upgrades, and maintaining access through webshells,” said Mandiant.Critical bug trioBoth scoring a near-maximum CVSS of 9.9, the newly disclosed critical bugs include a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-22899) that allows authenticated users to perform RCE via Windows File Resource Profiles, and a buffer overflow bug in Pulse Connect Secure Collaboration Suite (CVE-2021-22894) that allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code through a maliciously crafted meeting room.Catch up on the latest network security newsThe first critical vulnerability (CVE-2021-22893), an authentication bypass vulnerability, was caused by a client-side code sign verification failure, present since April 12 when “the validity of the code signing certificate expired”, whereby the certificate expiry time was checked instead of the code signing timestamp.Invanti has also disclosed and patched a high severity unrestricted file upload flaw (CVE-2021-22900).Software update and workaroundAll four CVEs have been addressed in Pulse Connect Secure version 9.1R.11.4.The vulnerabilities affect environments running Pulse Connect Secure 9.0RX or 9.1RX, with CVE-2021-22893 affecting PCS 9.0R3/9.1R1 and higher.Ivanti has released an exploit-detection tool, advised impacted customers to change all passwords, and offered a “workaround” file for users unable to update to the latest version.The Pulse Secure team has coordinated its response with the help of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Mandiant, and incident response firm Stroz Friedberg, among other parties.Phil Richards of Ivanti, which only acquired Pulse Secure in December 2020, said: “As sophisticated threat actors continue their attacks on U.S. businesses and government agencies, we will continue to work with our customers, the broader security industry, law enforcement and government agencies to mitigate these threats.“Companywide we are making significant investments to enhance our overall cyber security posture, including a broad[er] implementation of secure application development standards.”Ivanti declined to comment further in response to additional queries from The Daily Swig.DON’T FORGET TO READ Emotet clean-up: Security pros draw lessons from botnet menace as kill switch is activated",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/pulse-connect-secure-zero-day-stars-in-critical-patch-batch,"['Zero-day', 'Network', 'Security', 'VPN', 'Windows', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hardware', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Malware', 'RCE', 'Research', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Organizations', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Government', 'Finance']"
no,XSS in the wild: JavaScript-stuffed orders used to compromise Japanese e-commerce sites,Website vulnerabilities abused in new hacking campaign,"An established organized crime group has switched tactics by launching attacks on e-commerce stores that leverage cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits instead of traditional phishing lures.The group, dubbed ‘Water Pamola’ by Trend Micro, has been busy attacking e-commerce shops in Japan, Australia, and European countries using spam emails with malicious attachments for the last two years.Since last year, however, the group has switched targets and narrowed its focus by going after Japanese stores with maliciously constructed orders featuring hostile JavaScript code.This malicious code is inserted into the field where the customer’s address or company name would normally be located.Catch up on the latest e-commerce security newsThe rogue script is likely activated by exploiting an XSS vulnerability in a targeted store’s administration portal, according to Trend Micro.“The malicious behavior performed by the scripts includes page grabbing, credential phishing, web shell infection, and malware delivery,” the infosec firm explains in a blog post on the ongoing campaign.Data breach linked to Water PamolaIn at least one case, administrators of a website that fell victim to Water Pamola later disclosed that they had suffered a data breach.Their server was illegally accessed and personal information, which included names, credit card numbers, card expiration dates, and credit card security codes, was potentially leaked.This points to a Magecart-style attack with the twist that cybercriminals are not after a specific e-commerce framework, but e-commerce systems in general.INSIGHT Magecart attacks: Cat-and-mouse game continues in 2021“If the store’s e-commerce system is vulnerable to XSS attacks, the malicious script will be loaded and executed on the merchant’s management panel once someone (like a system administrator or store employee) opens the [malicious] order,” Trend Micro concludes.XSS.MeThe attack scripts were managed with an XSS attack framework called ‘XSS.ME’, which cybercriminals have further developed and customized to go beyond out-of-the box abilities to steal location and browser cookies.The source code of this framework is shared across many Chinese public forums, according to Trend Micro.The same attackers are also using a secondary line of attack that relies on social engineering to phish credentials or trick recipients into downloading malware under the guise of an Adobe Flash update.There are several Magecart attacker groups. They usually embed a skimmer into e-commerce webpages (via exploiting a vulnerability, gaining access to victim's network, compromising third party libraries, etc).Whenever data is entered into a form, the skimmer sends a copy of the data to a command-and-control server.In short, Magecart-style attacks target website visitors, whereas Water Pamola targets website administrators, Trend Micro's Jaromir Horejsi told The Daily Swig.“The attacker discovered [an] XSS vulnerability in [the EC-CUBE] framework, which is popular in Japan, thus Japanese sites are targeted,” Horejsi explained. “We can only speculate why they target websites built with [a] framework popular in Japan in the first place.“Although the number of targeted e-commerce shops is not high, we need to remember that each online shop can have many customers,” the researcher concluded.READ MORE PHP package manager flaw left millions of web apps open to abuse",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/xss-in-the-wild-javascript-stuffed-orders-used-to-compromise-japanese-e-commerce-sites,"['XSS', 'Cybercrime', 'E-Commerce', 'Magecart', 'Fraud', 'PHP', 'JavaScript', 'Finance', 'Retail', 'Browsers', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Research', 'Industry', 'News', 'Japan', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Oceania', 'Europe', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Malware', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak']"
no,PHP package manager flaw left millions of web apps open to abuse,Fix released for decade-old supply chain vulnerability impacting Composer,"Security researchers are warning that a software supply chain vulnerability impacting PHP could put millions of websites at risk.The flaw, discovered by security researchers at SonarSource, affects Composer, the main tool used to manage and install dependencies for PHP.Composer itself uses Packagist, an online service for managing PHP package requests, which is where the flaw was found.SonarSource discovered a vulnerability allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the Packagist server. This could be used to obtain maintainers’ credentials, or to redirect package requests.“An attacker changing the URL associated with the package symfony/symfony by one under their control would trick Composer into downloading the wrong source code, and with that deploy the attacker’s backdoor on the server running Composer,” Thomas Chauchefoin, vulnerability researcher at SonarSource told The Daily Swig.Supply chain attackAccording to Chauchefoin, SonarSource discovered the flaw when researching software supply chain attacks and investigating the components of the PHP packages ecosystem.SonarSource believes the flaw has gone undetected for 10 years, even though a vulnerability was found in the same code by researcher Max Justicz in 2018.“Its exploitability is very dependent on the command that is being called,” Chauchefoin explained. “That is very easy to overlook as user-controlled data is often already correctly sanitized against other injection vulnerabilities.”Read more of the latest open source software security newsThe overall popularity of PHP, combined with the number of PHP projects that use Composer, increases the risk.PHP runs on 80% of websites. SonarSource estimates that two-thirds of PHP projects use Composer to manage their dependencies.“The public Packagist infrastructure facilitates the downloads, but doesn’t directly host the source code,” said Chauchefoin.“It is estimated that the public Packagist infrastructure serves around 100 million metadata requests per month. These could have been backdoored with the vulnerability we reported.”Patch releasedThe flaw has now been fixed, and the researchers say the risks posed to sites using PHP is limited.“However, if you give users control to your composer.json or use the internal APIs VcsRepository / VcsDriver and derivatives, you should definitely upgrade to Composer 1.10.22 and 2.0.13,” he added.Nonetheless, web developers should stay vigilant, Jed Kafetz, head of pen testing at Redscan told The Daily Swig.“If an attacker can backdoor a common software package, each further application attempting to make use of the tool or software will be affected,” he said.RECOMMENDED Covid-19 test results of 164,000 Wyoming residents mistakenly exposed on GitHub“An attacker may then leverage this access to exfiltrate data causing a large-scale breach, or compromise the underlying network, or alternatively use it as a base for further attacks,” added Kafetz.“Supply chain compromise is a hugely advantageous route for an attacker to take. It goes beyond the realms of a targeted attack and can make a significant number of systems that were previously secure, suddenly vulnerable.”Full technical details can be found in the SonarSource blog post.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/php-package-manager-flaw-left-millions-of-web-apps-open-to-abuse,"['Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'PHP', 'Malware', 'Cyber-attacks']"
no,UK Computer Misuse Act: Lord Chris Holmes CBE on the CyberUp campaign’s call to overhaul ‘archaic’ legislation,Government peer tells The Daily Swig that legislators should aim to future-proof UK cybercrime laws,"The UK’s legislative framework for prosecuting cybercriminals dates back to a time when just 0.5% of the UK population had internet access.Enacted in 1990, the Computer Misuse Act (CMA) criminalized “unauthorised access” to computers following the acquittal of a hacker duo charged after finding and reporting a security vulnerability in a text-based computer system.Thirty-one years later and today’s security researchers and threat intelligence experts are still uncertain about the legality of their crucial work.‘Chilling effect’Four in five UK cybersecurity professionals said they were worried about breaking the law because the CMA lacked ‘public interest’ provisions, according to a 2020 survey by a campaign group that is lobbying for reform.Led by NCC Group, the CyberUp campaign is supported by UK technology association techUK, the Confederation of Business Industry (CBI), and infosec firms including Nettitude, F-Secure, and Digital Shadows.BACKGROUND Most UK cybersecurity pros fear breaking the law by simply doing their jobsCyberUp gained another prominent supporter last month when Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond CBE, a member of the UK’s upper legislative chamber, the House of Lords, called for an overhaul of the “archaic” legislation on his blog.“There’s a chilling effect right now,” the Conservative peer tells The Daily Swig. “Imagine [being a cybersecurity professional], knowing that individuals, our critical national infrastructure, our economy, our society could be far better protected, but for want of updating an old piece of legislation.”Lord Holmes says CyberUp has “identified very clear, effective, and easy to bring about solutions”‘Significantly out of date’Lord Holmes, Britain’s most successful Paralympic swimmer with nine gold medals, is abreast of the dizzying pace of technological change through his role on House of Lords Select Committees and All-Party Parliamentary Groups on blockchain, AI, digital skills, and the fourth industrial revolution, among other tech topics.“The Computer Misuse Act was constructed in such a very different time” and “is now significantly out of date”, Lord Holmes says. The legislation needs updating to ensure “our statute book is fit for the world in which we are currently living, transacting and working”.And the urgency of change has never been greater, he adds, given “probably at no other time in our history have we faced such significant threat”.Catch up on the latest UK cybersecurity newsTo illustrate his point, the pandemic has seen a surge in online fraud and ransomware attacks, and a series of supply chain attacks that impact numerous organizations and applications via single, vulnerable software components.To make matters worse, cybercrime gangs are often backed by the resources of nation states.Within this fraught context, cybersecurity professionals are operating “with one hand tied behind their backs”, according to Ollie Whitehouse, CTO of NCC Group, which leads the CyberUp campaign.UK infosec firms are restricted in their use of hacking tools compared to counterparts in some other jurisdictions‘Clear, effective solutions’Lord Holmes said he believes the CyberUp campaign is an effective vehicle for change because it has “clearly identified very clear, effective, and easy to bring about solutions” that would empower infosec professionals to “do their vital work”.These include public interest provisions that would free cybersecurity professionals from the risk of prosecution when probing hardware, applications, and networks for security vulnerabilities.Currently, “you’re either authorized or you’re not”, Whitehouse has previously told The Daily Swig.However, Whitehouse also warned that legislators must beware of giving cybercriminals wriggle room to “use the statuary defences as a way of getting out [of trouble]”.Future-proofingLord Holmes highlights another challenge: future-proofing the legislation to the degree that it is feasible.“There’s a need to have legislation which not only reflects the modern world, but has the ability – as much as it’s possible – to look forward, and, provide in a rightly understood, rightly permissive structuring” – legislation that enables professionals to “operate in the world, not just as it is, but also as it will be, as technology races on at an exponential pace”.CyberUp also proposes the creation of an accreditation scheme for cybersecurity providers, “individually applicable” ethical codes of conduct, “a commitment to maintain and share auditable logs of all activities, and an obligation to pass on all intelligence and information to the appropriate authorities”.READ MORE The UK’s Computer Misuse Act is ‘crying out for reform’In January 2020, another CyberUp supporter, the cross-sector lobbying group Criminal Law Reform network (CLRNN), published a report calling for more nuanced sentencing guidelines and noting that the CMA lacked definitions for terms such as ‘computer’, ‘data’, and ‘program’.The CyberUp campaign also estimates that fit-for-purpose legislation could create 6,400 jobs and £1.6 billion in additional revenue.Its 2020 survey also found that 91% of UK infosec professionals felt they were at a competitive disadvantage compared to counterparts in countries with superior legal regimes – the CMA, for example, somewhat restricts UK firms from developing hacking tools like the US-built IoT search engine Shodan. However for its part, the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which was passed in 1986, is nevertheless under fire for similar reasons, while 13% of 154 countries have no cybercrime legislation at all, according to figures from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).RELATED Terms of engagement: US computer crime laws out of step with changing attitudes to pen tests, ethical hacking‘Push for legislative change’The UK government has been more active on other fronts, putting cybersecurity at the heart of a recently unveiled defense, security, and foreign policy review, and creating a unified command – the ‘National Cyber Force’ – for its cybersecurity defenses.Lord Holmes believes the UK government has “done a good job with cyber” and hails the contribution of the private infosec sector and “the brilliant work done at GCHQ”.However, he thinks “there needs to be a greater understanding of this specific issue and the pressing need” for change.In lobbying for this change, the CyberUp campaign has “effectively stated what needs to be done” and built a broad base of support, he says.The next stage, he suggests, should be about raising awareness “beyond cyber professionals and the technology sector”, across society and parliament, “to get that weight of support to push for legislative change”.Lord Holmes says that he believes CyberUp should benefit “every single citizen in this country”, adding: “We all need to be become ‘cyber-uppers’.”READ MORE Explainer: What does the UK’s Integrated Review mean for cybersecurity?",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/uk-computer-misuse-act-lord-chris-holmes-cbe-on-the-cyberup-campaigns-call-to-overhaul-archaic-legislation,"['Interviews', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'UK', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Legal', 'Europe', 'North', 'America', 'US', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Ransomware', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Analysis', 'Certification', 'Coronavirus', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Government', 'Blockchain']"

It’s made around one million coordinated disclosures, resulting in around half a million vulnerability patches.The researchers say they’re not competing directly with the likes of HackerOne and Bugcrowd, which are in part now shifting to penetration testing and other traditional managed security services.“Open Bug Bounty is a pure crowd-security testing and vulnerability disclosure platform where everyone can participate without restrictions while following the rules and code of conduct,” they say.Meanwhile, gaming giant Valve came in for some criticism this month, after it was revealed that it took two years to fix critical security flaws in its Steam platform.There’s also been more on the subject of coordinated vulnerability disclosure this month, with researchers launching a new GitHub repository of the times disclosure has gone sour.The Research Threats project details examples of legal threats received by ethical hackers and how some were resolved - as well as giving guidance on the best ways of making a disclosure.“The hope is for security researchers to be able to use this to make safer decisions,"" the site's coordinators said.And finally, as some countries tentatively mark their first steps out of lockdown, we took a closer look at how bug bounty programs have been helping to secure the contact tracing app ecosystem.The World Health Organization launched one of the first disclosure programs in December 2020, in conjunction with HackerOne, and has led to the patching of seven security vulnerabilities so far. Other programs are active in the UK, France, and India.“Governments need to protect citizens’ data in order to minimize the risk of malicious acts, and bug bounty allows real in-depth security,” a spokesperson from YesWeHack told The Daily Swig.The latest bug bounty programs for May 2021The past month saw the arrival of several new bug bounty programs.

no,Stored XSS vulnerability patched in open source firewall pfSense,The vulnerability could be weaponized to execute arbitrary code in a victim’s browser,"A severe cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability impacting pfSense software has been patched by the vendor.Netgate solutions’ pfSense software is an open source offering based on FreeBSD for firewalling and routing, made available under an Apache 2.0 license.Products include pfSense Community Edition (CE) and the more advanced pfSense Plus, formerly known as pfSense Factory Edition (FE).VulnerabilityThe XSS flaw, found in the services_wol.php function of the pfSense CE and pfSense Plus software WebGUI, was discovered and reported by Fortinet Systems Engineer William Costa.Tracked as CVE-2021-27933, the vulnerability was added to Full Disclosure on April 27.Speaking to The Daily Swig, Costa said that an attack leveraging the vulnerability could allow attackers to create a malicious payload designed to trigger a stored XSS and lure a privileged user into executing the exploit, leading to application compromise.To exploit the bug, an attacker would need to inject code into the ‘Description’ parameter of the function. As there is a lack of proper encoding, malicious JavaScript could then be executed in a victim’s browser.“The page did not validate the contents of the Description field for Wake on LAN entries, nor did it encode the output when using the ‘Wake All Devices’ function which prints this value, leading to a possible XSS,” the security advisory reads.Read more of the latest XSS vulnerability newsXSS vulnerabilities come in a variety of flavors, some of the most severe being stored and persistent XSS, in which malicious code is injected into a target application and input is stored.These bugs are used to manipulate browser sessions, circumvent same origin policies, and can be exploited by attackers in a variety of scenarios including impersonating users, phishing, malicious payloads deployment, the theft of credentials and user data, and potentially the full hijack of a vulnerable application when a victim has high levels of privilege.Costa said the vulnerability was found as he conducted tests on a tool designed to scan for zero-day vulnerabilities.The engineer first explored PfSense for the existence of unknown bugs, found the XSS issue, and then applied the tool to see if the same vulnerability would be found (ironically, the tool failed).“In my test, [it] was possible [to] access the anti-CSRF token, that can [be] used [to] create and execute another action in PfSense, like creat[ing] a new user,” Costa added.PatchPfSense software versions 2.5.0 and below are impacted, alongside pfSense Plus software versions 21.02-p1 and below.The XSS flaw was acknowledged in release notes for pfSense 2.5.1 and pfSense Plus 21.02.2, which both contain a patch for the bug.The Daily Swig has reached out to the pfSense team and we will update when we hear back.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE QNAP fixes critical RCE vulnerabilities in NAS devices",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/stored-xss-vulnerability-patched-in-open-source-firewall-pfsense,"['XSS', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'PHP', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'JavaScript', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Network', 'Security', 'CSRF', 'Research']"
no,Raising the bar: Tiki app aims to hand ownership of personal data back to the individual,"More than 10,000 users have already signed up for access prior to Tiki’s launch in June","A new mobile app aims to put users back in control of their personal data by allowing them to control and monetize who has access to their information.Tiki – which is aptly named, since it was conceived in a Tiki bar – is the brainchild of Mike Audi, a data scientist whose background is in building data solutions software for large companies.The app, which is set to launch in June, allows users to see what information is held on them, and block access to certain data sets or data handlers. It also allows them to make money on whatever data they’d like to share, according to the developers.Since CEO and founder Audi first dreamt up the idea in December 2020, more than 10,000 people have signed up for access to Tiki across 185 countries, with 100,000 sign-ups predicted by the end of May.Ahead of Tiki’s official launch, Audi spoke to The Daily Swig about the journey towards creating a user-centric platform that hopes to change attitudes towards personal data security.Privacy problemsRecent years have seen multiple data privacy disasters, with high-profile cases such as the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal changing the way that even less privacy-conscious individuals feel about the avalanche of personal data that’s being collected and held on them by third parties.“It just compounded to the point where in the last year it really became clear that the issue with user data is that users have no say in their data,” said Audi as he discussed the reasons behind Tiki’s creation.When it comes to personal data, the Tiki app aims to give control back to the user“It was really kind of that simple – until somebody does something about it, users are simply at the whims of companies and governments to make choices around our data, and us as users were left with no say in it.“And, I mean, we’re not asking for a lot, just basic things – you should be able to see what data is collected on you, you should be able to control how it’s used, and if it’s sold, you deserve to get paid for it.”YOU MAY LIKE Covid-19 pandemic: How bug bounty programs helped secure some of the world’s leading track and trace appsUsers can log into accounts through Tiki via publicly available APIs, the first of which will be Gmail. Once their account is linked to Tiki, the app will serve up the data and supply the tools needed to control it.According to the developers, Tiki users can block or grant access to all companies or organizations, or mix and match who they do and don’t want to see your personal details.Digging inA glance at Tiki’s architecture demonstrates the level of detail the small team behind the app has been working at.Audi told The Daily Swig that user data is never held on its servers or cloud storage. Instead, the data is stored on the user’s phone, and any data they choose to share will be anonymized before it is sold to businesses, with the user being paid for doing so.By keeping the data on the user’s phone and never storing it on Tiki servers, this reduces the points of failure to one: the device itself.This prevents risks such as a data leak from Tiki itself, said Audi.The app’s code has also been open-sourced to invite scrutiny from the global developer community.Read more news about data privacyMore uniquely, Tiki’s developers said they are also in the process of building a custom blockchain to create an audit trail, meaning that users know everything the app has ever done with their data.Audi said: “You can see where your data is, how it’s being stored, how it’s being secured.“And it has to be custom because we’re going to cross 100,000 users in May, given our current trajectory – and no one’s ever created a blockchain for 100,000 users.“The largest blockchains out there are 10,000 nodes or so, so we had to be different to solve that problem.”According to founder Mike Audi, Tiki won't hold any user dataThe blockchain won’t have features such as smart contracts and proof of stake, as traditionally seen in the cryptocurrency space.Audi explained: “Decentralized consensus is all we need [to create] a constant trail of what happened for each person.“Any data on our blockchain is also end-to-end encrypted, using that same RSA key to privately encrypt the data, and then we use the elliptical curve to sign that data.”No personal data is ever put on the blockchain, said Audi, and all data is anonymized first.Next steps aheadA trial run is currently being conducted with 500 users before the app’s official launch in June.The team aims to have one million users by the end of 2021, a figure which Audi said he hopes will entice more companies to opening up their APIs.He told The Daily Swig: “With one million users on a platform, there’s a lot more control that we can bring to the users.“There’s a lot more availability, there’s companies we can go and negotiate with to get more access to more data… it’s a journey, and it starts with the users.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Enter the Matrix: Secure communications network hits 30 million user milestone",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/raising-the-bar-tiki-app-aims-to-hand-ownership-of-personal-data-back-to-the-individual,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Privacy', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Mobile', 'Organizations', 'Government', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Encryption', 'Interviews', 'Blockchain', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'GDPR', 'Surveillance']"

We are committed to being open about the situation and to offering our help,” he added.Remedial actionsIn a separate statement, Jeri Hendricks, privacy and security administrator at the WDH’s Office of Privacy, Security and Contracts, said: “GitHub has destroyed any dangling data from their servers.“Business practices have been revised to include prohibiting the use of GitHub or other public repositories and employees have been retrained.”The employee responsible has been “sanctioned”, according to the breach alert.The WDH said it started alerting affected individuals on April 26 and would mail all such notices by May 7.However, around 18,000 and 25,000 individuals respectively affected by the breath alcohol and Covid-19/influenza test breaches cannot be contacted due to “insufficient contact information”.A dedicated phone line has been set up to help anyone ascertain whether their personal data was involved, and affected individuals have been offered a free one-year subscription to an identity theft protection service.RELATED Google Android’s implementation of privacy-preserving contact tracing ‘flawed’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/covid-19-breath-alcohol-test-results-of-164-000-wyoming-residents-mistakenly-exposed-on-github,"['Data', 'Leak', 'Healthcare', 'Coronavirus', 'US', 'GitHub', 'Data', 'Breach', 'North', 'America', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'HIPAA', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Privacy', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Microsoft', 'Compliance']"
no,Google Android’s implementation of privacy-preserving contact tracing ‘flawed’,Tech giant downplays location and Covid-states leakage concerns," Security researchers have gone public with troubling privacy issues in Google’s support for contact-tracing apps that they claim can expose users’ information.AppCensus, a privacy analysis company, discovered the shortcomings of the Android implementation of the Google-Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework as part of a US Department of Homeland Security-funded program.The team disclosed the issues to Google in mid-February. Google, however, rejected the vulnerability report, prompting AppCensus’s decision to go public with its concerns in a blog post on Tuesday (April 27).Losses and GAENsAppCensus is at pains to stress that it has no issue with Covid-19 contact tracing apps per se; rather, it’s the Google implementation of what was supposed to be a privacy-preserving technology it has concerns about.GAEN offers a decentralized system for Bluetooth-based contact tracing mobile apps.The framework is designed to help public health authorities manage the spread of Covid-19 and save lives. With the exposure notification system, neither Google, Apple, nor other users can see the user’s identity, as all of the logging happens on a user’s device. READ MORE Covid-19 pandemic: How bug bounty programs helped secure some of the world’s leading track and trace appsThe theory is that apps based on the decentralized GAEN approach jointly developed by Google and Apple ought to be more privacy friendly.Google’s implementation of GAEN, however, logs crucial pieces of information, according to AppCensus.While this data could potentially be read by hundreds of third-party apps, apps downloaded from the Google Play store have been blocked from accessing system logs since 2012.However, Google allows phone hardware manufacturers, network operators, and their commercial partners (for example, advertising libraries) to pre-install “privileged” apps, according to AppCensus.Proximity alertThis is a particular problem because the logs contain rolling proximity identifiers (RPIs), which are broadcast from other phones running the contact tracing app that come within range of a user’s device, as well as the corresponding Bluetooth Mac addresses. The log also contains details of the RPIs, which change every 15 minutes or so, broadcast by the user’s device.The end result is that apps developed by device manufacturers including Samsung and Xiaomi with the ability to read system logs can also access sensitive data from devices running Bluetooth-based contact tracing apps.AppCensus does not fault device manufacturers for the issue but rather the “log[ging of] sensitive data to the system log in the first place” that results from Google’s “flawed” implementation of GAEN.Data contained in the logs can be combined with positive temporary exposure keys (TEKs) published by public health authorities to potentially infer a user’s Covid status, according to AppCensus.Worse yet, an entity that collects logs can also associate it to the user’s identity.‘No indication’In response to queries from The Daily Swig, Google offered a statement acknowledging shortcomings in its implementation that exposed Bluetooth identifiers, but argued that this data failed to expose a user’s location or identifying information, contrary to AppCensus’ report. We were notified of an issue where the Bluetooth identifiers were temporarily accessible to some pre-installed applications for debugging purposes. Immediately upon being made aware of this research, we began the necessary process to review the issue, consider mitigations, and ultimately update the code.These Bluetooth identifiers do not reveal a user’s location or provide any other identifying information and we have no indication that they were used in any way – nor that any app was even aware of this.Although Google’s statement implies there was never much of a privacy risk as a result of AppCensus’ findings, The Daily Swig understands a roll out of Android updates addressing the issue is already underway.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE European privacy regulators lay down rules for Covid-status passports",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-androids-implementation-of-privacy-preserving-contact-tracing-flawed,"['Privacy', 'Mobile', 'Research', 'Google', 'Android', 'Healthcare', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Apple', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Government', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Telecommunications']"

no,GoAhead devs fix null byte injection vulnerability in embedded web server,Exploitation requires additional vulnerability or device misconfiguration,"UPDATED Embedthis has patched a null byte injection vulnerability in GoAhead, the embedded web server deployed in hundreds of millions of devices.“A specially crafted URL with a %00 character embedded before the extension can cause an incorrect file with a truncated filename to be served,” reads a security advisory on GitHub documenting the bug.Citing hypothetical URL https://example.com/example%00.html, the advisory says “the %00 is decoded to be a NULL”, resulting in the file handler serving ‘example’ instead of ‘example.html’.As a result, “remote attackers could gain access to documents with names that are strict subsets of longer valid URLs.”The advisory nevertheless describes the bug’s severity as ‘low’ since “an exploit requires [either] an additional vulnerability via uploaded malicious files” or device misconfigurations.‘Unlikely setup’ The flaw was discovered by Luke Rindels, an infosec Master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University, during a PlaidCTF 2021 challenge earlier this month that involved manipulating IoT camera and sensor values.“The vulnerability abuses the mismatch between route extension parsing and the decoded filename to dupe GoAhead into thinking a file should be sent to the JST [JavaScript Template] handler even when it has an improper extension,” Rindels tells The Daily Swig.“GoAhead should only send .html files to the JST handler, but the vulnerability allows for any file to be sent to the JST handler.”While Rindels achieved XSS via a CSP bypass this was, he conceded, done “using a highly customized and unlikely setup”.With the right device misconfigurations and “required combined vulnerabilities – it could cause a DoS or [an attacker to] gain unwanted control of the device”, Embedthis CEO and founder Michael O’Brien tells The Daily Swig.Barriers to exploitationHowever, real-world exploitation appears to be an unlikely scenario.The server must be misconfigured to “permit file uploads to a directory that also allows executing JST templates” and a JST template must be uploaded “to a file in the upload directory of the same base name without the extension”, before the file is served with %00, explains O’Brien.But “if an attacker can change the route configuration, they already have access to the entire server and documents anyway”.  Catch up on the latest infosec research news Moreover, the vulnerability “requires a file of the same base name without extension to be present. i.e. ‘example’ and example.html. Needless to say, most device builders do not do this and [it] would be rather strange to do it on purpose.”JST expressions are also device-specific, he adds, so source code access is probably required too. Finding the flawWhile hunting for evidence of incorrect extension parsing during the CTF, Rindels realized that “the request URL must have been decoded, otherwise it wouldn’t be able to call strrchr() with . and / delimiters”, recounts Rindels in a blog post published yesterday (26 April).He suspected that a null bytes exploit would fail, possibly because “dangerous URL encodings like %00” wouldn’t be allowed or decoded, resulting in an error being served or an “attempt to serve /example%00.html”.Alternatively, he speculated, “if the %00 is decoded, in a request for /example%00.html the extension will simply be cut-off. There will be no extension and GoAhead will attempt to serve /example.” Undeterred, he uploaded a snapshot with the name example containing <script nonce=""<% nonce(); %>""> alert(1);</script>, issued a request for /data/snapshot/example%00.html, “and to my amazement the nonce was there!”Incidentally, the exploit failed to secure the CTF flag because Chrome blocks “encoded null bytes in URLs”, but could pave the way to Rindels’ first-ever CVE. Patching, mitigationEmbedthis has addressed the vulnerability in GoAhead versions 4.1.4 and 5.1.2. Version 2.2 is not affected.Embedthis “responded very quickly”, patching the flaw on April 5, four days after it was reported, said Rindels. As well as applying the update, O’Brien urges users to avoid serving JST templates “from directories that do not overlap with upload directories. You should NEVER have file uploads to a directory that permits serving content and processing JST templates”. The vendor says GoAhead is the world’s most popular embedded web server, hosting “dynamic embedded web applications via an event driven, single-threaded core” within medical devices, networking equipment, and factory automation systems, among other devices.

no,"Machine learning security vulnerabilities are a growing threat to the web, report highlights",Security industry needs to tackle nascent AI threats before it’s too late,"As machine learning (ML) systems become a staple of everyday life, the security threats they entail will spill over into all kinds of applications we use, according to a new report.Unlike traditional software, where flaws in design and source code account for most security issues, in AI systems, vulnerabilities can exist in images, audio files, text, and other data used to train and run machine learning models.This is according to researchers from Adversa, a Tel Aviv-based start-up that focuses on security for artificial intelligence (AI) systems, who outlined their latest findings in their report, The Road to Secure and Trusted AI, this month.“This makes it more difficult to filter, handle, and detect malicious inputs and interactions,” the report warns, adding that threat actors will eventually weaponize AI for malicious purposes.“Unfortunately, the AI industry hasn’t even begun to solve these challenges yet, jeopardizing the security of already deployed and future AI systems.”Attacks on vision, analytics, and language systemsThere’s already a body of research that shows many machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, imperceptible manipulations that cause models to behave erratically.BACKGROUND Adversarial attacks against machine learning systems – everything you need to knowAccording to the researchers at Adversa, machine learning systems that process visual data account for most of the work on adversarial attacks, followed by analytics, language processing, and autonomy. Machine learning systems have a distinct attack surface“With the growth of AI, cyberattacks will focus on fooling new visual and conversational Interfaces,” the researchers write.“Additionally, as AI systems rely on their own learning and decision making, cybercriminals will shift their attention from traditional software workflows to algorithms powering analytical and autonomy capabilities of AI systems.”Adversarial attacks against web applicationsWeb developers who are integrating machine learning models into their applications should take note of these security issues, warned Alex Polyakov, co-founder and CEO of Adversa.“There is definitely a big difference in so-called digital and physical attacks. Now, it is much easier to perform digital attacks against web applications: sometimes changing only one pixel is enough to cause a misclassification,” Polyakov told The Daily Swig, adding that attacks against ML systems in the physical world have more stringent demands and require much more time and knowledge. Read more of the latest infosec research news Polyakov also warned about vulnerabilities in machine learning models served over the web such as API services provided by large tech companies.“Most of the models we saw online are vulnerable, and it has been proven by several research reports as well as by our internal tests,” Polyakov. “With some tricks, it is possible to train an attack on one model and then transfer it to another model without knowing any special details of it.“Also, you can perform CopyCat attack to steal a model, apply the attack on it and then use this attack on the API.”Tainted datasets and machine learning modelsMost machine learning algorithms require large sets of labeled data to train models. In many cases, instead of going through the effort of creating their own datasets, machine learning developers search and download datasets published on GitHub, Kaggle, or other web platforms.Eugene Neelou, co-founder and CTO of Adversa, warned about potential vulnerabilities in these datasets that can lead to data poisoning attacks.“Poisoning data with maliciously crafted data samples may make AI models learn those data entries during training, thus learning malicious triggers,” Neelou told The Daily Swig. “The model will behave as intended in normal conditions, but malicious actors may call those hidden triggers during attacks.”RELATED TrojanNet – a simple yet effective attack on machine learning modelsNeelou also warned about trojan attacks, where adversaries distribute contaminated models on web platforms.“Instead of poisoning data, attackers have control over the AI model internal parameters,” Neelou said. “They could train/customize and distribute their infected models via GitHub or model platforms/marketplaces.”Unfortunately, GitHub and other platforms don’t yet have any safeguards in place to detect and defend against data poisoning schemes. This makes it very easy for attackers to spread contaminated datasets and models across the web. Attacks against machine learning and AI systems are set to increase over the coming yearsFuture trends in AI securityNeelou warned that while “AI is extensively used in myriads of organizations, there are no efficient AI defenses.”He also raised concern that under currently established roles and procedures, no one is responsible for AI/ML security.“AI security is fundamentally different from traditional computer security, so it falls under the radar for cybersecurity teams,” he said. “It’s also often out of scope for practitioners involved in responsible/ethical AI, and regular AI engineering hasn't solved the MLOps and QA testing yet.” Check out more machine learning security newsOn the bright side, Polyakov said that adversarial attacks can also be used for good. Adversa recently helped one of its clients use adversarial manipulations to develop web CAPTCHA queries that are resilient against bot attacks.“The technology itself is a double-edged sword and can serve both good and bad,” he said.Adversa is one of several organizations involved in dealing with the emerging threats of machine learning systems.Last year, in a joint effort, several major tech companies released the Adversarial Threat ML Matrix, a set of practices and procedures meant to secure the machine learning training and delivery pipeline in different settings.

High-value targetThe incident was first documented in a blog post from Danish infosec firm CSIS Group on April 23, which dubbed the malware ‘Moserpass’.Enterprise password managers are used to securely store corporate passwords, credentials, secrets, tokens, and keys that grant access to confidential systems and data.READ MORE CocoaPods RCE exploit exposed keys to repo used by three million mobile apps Click Studios says Passwordstate is used by more than 29,000 customers, including Fortune 500 companies and organizations in verticals including banking, utilities, and healthcare.However, in a second security advisory (PDF) posted yesterday (April 25), the Australian firm maintained that “the number of affected customers still appears to be very low”.This assessment, however, “may change as more customers supply the requested information”, the company said.Moserpass attack vectorsClick Studios said the attacker compromised the upgrade director on Click Studios’ website that “points the in-place upgrade to the appropriate version of software located on the content distribution network”.The Adelaide-based company did not confirm the attack methods involved but indicated that they did not include either abuse of “stolen or weak credentials”.The second advisory also stated that Click Studios’ “CDN network was not compromised” and that another bulletin independently produced for internal use supported its own “initial analysis”.TimelineUpgrades conducted between April 20, 20:33 UTC and April 22, 00:30 UTC put customers at risk of downloading “a malformed Passwordstate_upgrade.zip file”.The software vendor said it began helping “the small number of customers who were reporting issues with in-place upgrades” on April 21, and alerted customers by email the following day.Downloading the malicious file set in train a process that culminated in the extraction of passwords and other system information to the attackers’ CDN network. Catch up on the latest infosec research news This included the names of computers, users, domains, current processes, and all running services; current process IDs; all running processes’ names and IDs; display names and statuses; and Passwordstate instances’ proxy server addresses, usernames, and passwords.Password table fields relayed to the attacker included Title, UserName, Description, GenericField1, GenericField2, GenericField3, Notes, URL, and Password.“There is no evidence of encryption keys or database connection strings being posted to the bad actor CDN network”, said Click Studios.

no,Emotet clean-up: Security pros draw lessons from botnet menace as kill switch is activated,Malware-as-a-Service trailblazer finally zapped out of existence,"The FBI and German police orchestrated the wholesale removal of remnants of the Emotet malware strain from previously infected Windows systems on Sunday (April 25).The action was made possible by the seizure of servers in January and arrest of two Ukrainian residents suspected of orchestrating Emotet, the world’s largest malware-spewing botnet at the time of its takedown.Soon after the seizure a kill switch file was distributed to infected systems. This file, which contained a clean-up routine that wiped Emotet infection from compromised devices, was set by a timer that activated on Sunday.From banking trojan to malware dropperEmotet began as a banking trojan at the time it was first detected in 2014. From 2016 onwards, the malware was updated and reconfigured to act as a conduit – or ‘dropper’ – to push other strains of malware onto compromised systems.According to the US Department of Justice, machines affected by Emotet worldwide number just over 1.6 million.The latest intervention follows the FBI’s proactive response to the Exchange Hafnium attacks, where malicious web shells were replaced.Catch up on the latest cybercrime newsThere are other precedents for this kind of law enforcement intervention, according to threat intel experts.Sean Nikkel, senior threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows, commented: “The most recent precedent for this is the action taken by the FBI to address the malicious web shells emplaced as a result of the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. Reporting did not appear to indicate an unexpected impact as a result of FBI actions.”Nikkel continued: “Prior to this, we’ve seen law enforcement and security firms sinkhole or take down various malicious botnets and malware, from the notorious WannaCry and GameOver Zeus to crypto-mining operations like Retadup.” Infragard?Paul Robichaux, senior director of product management at Quest, said both Exchange Hafnium and Emotet clean-ups were authorized by the application of a recently granted legal authority by federal authorities.DON’T FORGET TO READ Mining technology company Gyrodata hit by ransomware attack “The FBI already had the legal authority to search for and seize evidence of federal crimes, and their InfraGard program helps critical infrastructure providers secure their systems, so its recent responses are news mostly because they are a new application of that authority,” Robichaux explained.Law enforcement stepping in to clean up after botnet takedowns is justified because “leaving individual companies to clean them up themselves is a legitimate national security problem”, according to Robichaux.Rise and fallEnterprises need to learn lessons from how Emotet got onto systems in the first place if we’re to stand any chance of preventing similar infestations in future, according to Digital Shadows, which has put together a blog post chronicling the rise and fall of the botnet.“Emotet spread through phishing and spam containing malicious links and attachments,” Nikkel told The Daily Swig.“Enterprises should employ active defences against phishing and spam, many of which can scan and sandbox attachments, block known bad senders, or look for other indicators to stop delivery to users.”RECOMMENDED ‘We are not motivated by profits’ – Open Bug Bounty maintainers on finding a niche in the crowdsourced AppSec market",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/emotet-clean-up-security-pros-draw-lessons-from-botnet-menace-as-kill-switch-is-activated,"['Cybercrime', 'Malware', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Windows', 'Industry', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Phishing', 'Antivirus', 'Germany', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Europe', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Government', 'Passwords', 'Legal', 'Microsoft', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Finance', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Research', 'Fraud', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security']"
no,Dan Kaminsky: Tributes pour in for security researcher who died after short illness,‘We owe him so much… People who will never know his name owe Dan’,"The information security community has lost another leading light, after it was announced that prominent security researcher and DNS specialist Dan Kaminsky has died.The news was confirmed by Kaminsky’s niece yesterday (April 25), who said her uncle had passed away after a short illness due to complications arising from diabetes, a condition he had “struggled [with] for years”.Kaminsky, 42, was known for his many contributions including the discovery of a serious DNS cache poisoning vulnerability in 2008, early work in developing a framework to address SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks called Interpolique, and much more.The US-born hacker was a frequent speaker at security conferences worldwide including Black Hat and DEF CON. Respect among his peers led to his nomination as one of the trusted community representatives for the DNSSEC root zone. What differentiated Kaminsky from other figures who might be considered to be among the “elders of the internet” was his kindness and the help and encouragement he offered to other hackers – particularly those making their start in the industry.A positive force for changeAlmost immediately after yesterday’s announcement, tributes came pouring in from those close to Dan and others who had felt his influence despite never meeting face to face.Sharing a video of her speaking with Kaminsky on coordinated vulnerability disclosures back in 2008, hacker and Luta Security founder Katie Moussouris said: “Dan... was the catalyst for the formal creation of Microsoft Vulnerability Research. We owe him so much, we all do. People who will never know his name owe Dan.”“Dan Kaminsky’s passion, creativity, desire to learn and teach really help influence both #defcon and @BlackHatEvents in the early years,” read an announcement from the DEF CON management team.“He became an icon in all the positive ways and we look up to him. RIP Hacker.”Security researcher Mohammad Aldoub said: “Dan helped me a lot personally with guidance and advice when I first entered this field, he was such an empowering figure.”“No one that knew Dan Kaminsky well is talking about DNS today,” said security pro and Black Hat board member Matt Devost. “They are talking about kindness, boundless energy and positivity, spontaneous adventures, and how hard he worked to lift others up.“Want to emulate one of the greatest hackers of all time? Let that be your guide.”“Dan Kaminsky was one of smartest people I’ve ever known,” said former Cyberscoop editor-in-chief Greg Otto. “He wrote an op-ed for @CyberScoopNews the day it debuted, where he called for a better way to guard the internet.”“Many people are remarking on all those in their timelines [who] are talking about [Dan Kaminsky],” said infosec’s most popular anonymous commentator, SwiftOnSecurity.“This is the impact you can have with effervescent intrigue and kindness.

no,CocoaPods RCE exploit exposed keys to repo used by three million mobile apps,Researcher uncovers vulnerability after probing Signal’s iOS source code," A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the central CocoaPods server could have potentially impacted up to three million mobile apps that relied on the open source package manager.Swiftly patched once detected, the serious security flaw had lurked unnoticed since 2015.Breaching the CocoaPods server would have exposed the keys for the CocoaPods specifications repo and “allowed an attacker to poison any package download”, according to a blog post by security researcher Max Justicz.CocoaPods, which is built using the Ruby programming language, is used by Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects and has more than 82,000 libraries.Supply chain threatCocoaPods maintainer Orta Therox likened the potential impact of the flaw to that caused by XcodeGhost, a counterfeit version of macOS development environment Xcode that in 2015 compromised a number of apps popular in China.However, Therox cautioned against exaggerating the downstream threat.“It's definitely feasible that over time a poisoned set of specs would affect all apps, but the timescale to do that would be pretty long and it would very likely have been spotted because we use a public git repo to store all of the data which the apps download from,” he told The Daily Swig. RELATED Vulnerability in Homebrew macOS package manager could allow arbitrary code execution “We don't host the dependencies code nor the definitions in the place where the exploit occurred.”He added: “In our case, a poisoned dependency would show as a change in the user’s project which would be pretty easy to inspect and report.”In his own blog post dissecting the vulnerability, Therox said no evidence of abuse had surfaced – but that “doesn't mean it hasn't happened. Six years is a long time.”‘Why hack just Signal?’Justicz was probing the iOS source code for encrypted messaging service Signal when he noticed something that could have far-reaching implications: Podfile, which lists Signal’s CocoaPods dependencies.“Why hack just Signal if we can find a bug that affects every app using CocoaPods?” said the researcher.Vulnerable validationJusticz noted that “when you upload a package spec to CocoaPods, it tries to make sure you didn’t accidentally link to a private repository.”This was done with a server-side validation that, explained Therox, used “the git CLI on trunk using git ls-remote to replicate the same check as a user’s git would, but ls-remote has a parameter --upload-pack which can be used to execute a new shell,” he continued.“This meant an attacker could create a specially crafted podspec via source, which would trigger the --upload-pack param and execute an arbitrary command on trunk.” Read more of the latest software supply chain attack news This “gave a possible attacker the ability to read the environment variables, which could be used to write to the CocoaPods/Specs repo and read the trunk database.”A malicious actor could then potentially obtain session keys that “act like unique passwords to accounts” and which “are used to connect authenticated users to pods”.Timeline and mitigationsCourtesy of a “great technical write-up”, said Therox, the bug was patched on 19 April, around 10 hours after it was reported and within an hour of Therox starting work on a fix – “which is really cool for a completely volunteer-driven project!” Justicz told The Daily Swig.Therox said all session keys are being wiped and that “the issue has been patched server-side and does not affect your CocoaPods installation.“We don't think the CocoaPods Specs repo has been tampered with,” he added, but tools have been created to validate commits.Pod authors can verify whether their Pods have had an unexpected release here.Therox also recommends that they “log in again to [the] trunk again to deploy any new Podspecs”. Automated deployments, he added, “will break, and you will need to pod trunk register again and replace your COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN”.Further recommendationsJusticz also recommends that developers “consider vendoring dependencies and reviewing their updates carefully”.Authors of dependency managers, meanwhile, should ideally treat package contents and version control software as “toxic waste” – or at least use a sandbox like gVisor, which Justicz “couldn’t escape” when, last year, he “found an RCE bug in proxy.golang.org which was shelling out to some vulnerable version control software”.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cocoapods-rce-exploit-exposed-keys-to-repo-used-by-three-million-mobile-apps,"['Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Mobile', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Apple', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'Research', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Passwords']"
no,Xerox vulnerability disclosure legal threat withdrawn,The researcher said that important information on the vulnerabilities was ‘not suppressed’,"A cease-and-desist notice targeting the security researcher who discovered vulnerabilities impacting Xerox printers has been squashed with the removal of a “few extracts of code” in his public disclosure.Airbus Security Lab security researcher Raphaël Rigo was due to host a talk at this year’s Infiltrate security conference to discuss critical vulnerabilities discovered in Xerox Multifunction Printers.However, as previously reported, a notice was published by Infiltrate in February, with less than an hour to go until the talk, informing attendees that the session was cancelled due to legal problems.BACKGROUND Xerox legal threat reportedly silences researcher at Infiltrate security conference“We must cease and desist publication, presentation, and discussions related to the content of Raphaël’s talk,” the notice read.This week, Rigo told The Daily Swig that the “issues had been resolved” and so the online talk, titled ‘Attacking Xerox Multifunction Printers’, was able to go live yesterday (April 22).Infiltrate said on April 15 that the cease-and-desist order had “been lifted”.Disclosure roadblocksRigo’s research began in January 2019. However, disruption caused by Covid-19 and the last-minute legal threat meant that the work could only be made public this month.During the presentation, which included attendees from Xerox, Rigo explained that in order for the talk to go ahead, certain “elements” were removed, including “some passphrase details and a few extracts of code”.“Although, the core is the same and no information I consider important was suppressed,” the researcher added.Rigo’s talk is now available to watch on VimeoThe researcher was then able to describe his examination of the Xerox WorkCenter 7835 and AltaLink 8030 – heavy-duty EAL2+ certified printers – on firmware released between 2017 and 2020.Issues reported to the vendor included hardcoded, default account credentials; ‘service’ accounts hidden in the UI code of which passwords could not be changed; a “trivial-to-exploit” remote command injection vulnerability (CVE-2019-10880); a privilege escalation in AJAX handlers; a SQL injection flaw in the printers’ account management page; and a remote code execution bug caused by clone file functionality.The small printXerox tackled the vulnerabilities in a September 2020 security release. This included an overhaul of privilege levels, enabling some accounts to only work when there was local access, and disabling backdoor accounts.The other vulnerabilities reported by Rigo have also been resolved.Rigo also described command injection and buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Xerox VersaLink, as well as security weaknesses caused by backdoor URLs accessible with hardcoded accounts and the same clone file RCE vulnerability.Read more of the latest infosec research news from around the worldThese security flaws were resolved in June 2020, a year after disclosure. However, the clone file RCE was not fixed until March 5, 2021, as initial attempts to patch the problem failed.“The multifunction printers are a really easy target as large companies still like using paper and are often overlooked by security teams, as contractors [usually] are responsible for these peripheral devices on an enterprise network,” Rigo said.Xerox declined to comment.In related news this month, a new GitHub repository was launched to document battles between researchers and organizations which are the subject of good faith research, including reactions, legal demands, and cease-and-desist notices.RELATED Security researcher launches GoFundMe campaign to fight legal threat over vulnerability disclosure",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/xerox-vulnerability-disclosure-legal-threat-withdrawn,"['Hacking', 'News', 'Legal', 'Industry', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'VDP', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Events', 'Hardware', 'RCE', 'Network', 'Security', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Vulnerabilities', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Research']"
no,Vulnerability in Homebrew macOS package manager could allow arbitrary code execution,Flaw meant malicious code injected into Cask repo was merged automatically,"A vulnerability in Homebrew, the enormously popular open source package manager for macOS and Linux, enabled attackers to execute malicious Ruby code on machines running the application.Security researcher ‘RyotaK’ found the flaw during a vulnerability assessment sanctioned by the project maintainers after probing the CI script that Homebrew runs using GitHub Actions.The Japanese researcher found that “in the Homebrew/homebrew-cask repository, it was possible to merge the malicious pull request by confusing the library that is used in the automated pull request review script developed by the Homebrew project”, according to a blog post published on April 21.Spoofing the parserIn a security alert, Homebrew maintainer Markus Reiter said: “This is due to a flaw in the git_diff dependency of the review-cask-pr GitHub Action, which is used to parse a pull request’s diff for inspection.“Due to this flaw, the parser can be spoofed into completely ignoring the offending lines, resulting in successfully approving a malicious pull request.”The issue arose, he continued, because: “Whenever an affected cask tap received a pull request to change only the version of a cask, the review-cask-pr GitHub Action would automatically review and approve the pull request. The approval would then trigger the automergeGitHub Action which would merge the approved pull request.”Securing the repoIn light of the findings, which were reported to Homebrew’s HackerOne program, Reiter said the vulnerable review-cask-pr and automerge  GitHub Actions have been disabled and removed from all repositories.Moreover, bots can no longer commit to homebrew/cask* repositories, with pull requests now requiring a manual review and approval by a maintainer.“We are improving documentation to help onboard new homebrew/cask maintainers and training existing homebrew/core maintainers to help with homebrew/cask,” added Reiter.RyotaK compromised a single cask “with a harmless change for the duration of the demonstration pull request until its reversal”, he continued. “No action is required by users due to this incident.”The gravity of the bug prompted RyotaK to comment: “I strongly feel that a security audit against the centralized ecosystem is required. I want to perform security audits against PyPI/npm registry… etc, but as they don’t allow the vulnerability assessment explicitly, I can’t do this.”The flaw was reported on April 17, and was fully fixed two days later on April 19.Homebrew, which simplifies the installation of software on macOS and Linux, is currently ranked 63 in the Gitstar breakdown of organizations by GitHub star rating. ",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerability-in-homebrew-macos-package-manager-could-allow-arbitrary-code-execution,"['Apple', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'RCE', 'Research', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'VDP', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Authentication', 'DevSecOps', 'DevOps', 'Secure', 'Development', 'GitHub', 'Vulnerabilities', 'API']"
no,Ill-advised research on Linux kernel lands computer scientists in hot water,University of Minnesota banned from Linux kernel contributions in fallout over buggy commits experiment,"UPDATED Computer scientists who submitted supposed security patches that actually added security vulnerabilities to the Linux kernel have been placed under investigation by their university.Qiushi Wu and Kangjie Lu ran the experiment with so-called ‘hypocrite commits’ to establish that they could act a vector for stealthily introducing vulnerabilities in open source software.More specifically, the University of Minnesota duo successfully offered use-after-free vulnerabilities that were accepted as seemingly beneficial commits to the Linux kernel.The researchers argued the exercise offered evidence that the Linux patch-review process is flawed.Kernel developers ain’t no lab ratsThe research attracted criticism back in December while the work was still ongoing, although the drama only escalated over recent days with the publication of the research (PDF).According to the researchers, all of the “bug-introducing patches stayed only in the email exchanges, without being adopted or merged into any Linux branch”, so no harm to users resulted from the exercise.RECOMMENDED When vulnerability disclosure goes sour: Researchers document the legal threats and risks faced by ethical hackersOn the contrary, the researchers were able to develop tools for patch testing and verifications, as well as a revised code of conduct as a result of the exercise, they said (PDF).Open source developers, however, have cried foul over the exercise, which they complain was both a nuisance and a waste of time.“Linux kernel developers do not like being experimented on, we have enough real work to do,” Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman of the Linux Foundation responded on Twitter.‘Bad faith’Kroah-Hartman followed up in a post on a mailing list on Wednesday by denouncing the research as an attempt to try to test the kernel community's ability to review “known malicious” changes, adding that the exercise was carried out in “bad faith”.Future contributions from the University of Minnesota to the Linux kernel have been banned as a result of the incident, a sanction criticized as an overreaction on social media by some observers.Read more of the latest infosec research newsThe university itself has launched an investigation into the incident, as confirmed in an official statement:We take this situation extremely seriously. We have immediately suspended this line of research.We will investigate the research method & the process by which this research method was approved, determine appropriate remedial action, & safeguard against future issues, if needed.We will report our findings back to the community as soon as practical.The Daily Swig invited both researchers to comment on the unfolding controversy. No word back as yet, but we’ll update this story as and when more information comes to hand.Kroah-Hartman of the Linux Foundation told The Daily Swig that since he hadn’t as yet heard from the university, he had nothing at present to add beyond his comments on the mailing list.A paper on the research, ‘Open Source Insecurity: Stealthily Introducing Vulnerabilities via Hypocrite Commits’, was published at the 42nd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.'Deception'In a thread of Twitter, Sarah Jamie Lewis noted that she and other researchers had expressed concerns about the controversial study right from its inception.These concerns were based on a draft abstract and first page of the paper dating from December. Implicit criticisms of the research have only grown sharper with the publication of the completed research.""Despite what their paper says they didn't get an IRB-exemption until *after* they posted about their IEEESP paper acceptance and a group of researchers (inc myself) expressed concern,"" Lewis writes.There was no system in place for prior informed consent or debriefing of findings from the research, according to Lewis, who added that the study amounted to nothing beyond a ""deception study on human subjects"".This story was updated to add comment from Sarah Jamie LewisINTERVIEW ‘We are not motivated by profits’ – Open Bug Bounty maintainers on finding a niche in the crowdsourced AppSec market",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ill-advised-research-on-linux-kernel-lands-computer-scientists-in-hot-water,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Linux', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Education', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevSecOps']"
no,‘We are not motivated by profits’ – Open Bug Bounty maintainers on finding a niche in the crowdsourced AppSec market,"Vulnerability disclosure platform driven by ‘transparency and fairness’, with over 500,000 bugs fixed since 2014","Open Bug Bounty has around 1,300 active bug bounty programs and 22,000 registered security researchers, and is approaching one million coordinated disclosures, resulting in around half a million vulnerability patches.The project, which was founded in 2014, is nevertheless dwarfed in scale by the commercial bug bounty market’s big beasts.However, the security researchers and other “cybersecurity veterans” who maintain the platform insist that the likes of HackerOne and Bugcrowd – founded earlier in 2012 and 2011, respectively – are not direct competitors.RECOMMENDED ‘Train the basics’ – Bug bounty hunter ‘Xel’ on forging a lucrative career in ethical hacking“Many commercial bug bounty platforms are now shifting to penetration testing and other traditional MSSP services, diverging from traditional bug bounties,” Open Bug Bounty’s 10 maintainers told The Daily Swig in collectively-written comments.Indeed, the growing popularity of ‘pen test-as-a-service’ has also given rise to red team-inspired crowdsourced security platforms like Cobalt and Synack.By contrast, “Open Bug Bounty is a pure crowd-security testing and vulnerability disclosure platform where everyone can participate without restrictions while following the rules and code of conduct.”‘Not motivated by profits’Another key distinction between Open Bug Bounty and rival platforms, which also include Intigriti, YesWeHack, HackenProof, and more, is the former’s status as a non-profit.Moreover, the service is free to use for website owners as well as researchers – leaving the maintainers to cover hosting and web development costs themselves.“We are not motivated by profits and [are] happy to spend our evenings to maintain the platform,” they say.So, what motivates them to invest both time and money into the project?“We are close to reaching one million fixed vulnerabilities,” they explain. “We are excited to see how security researchers and website owners leverage the platform to make the web a safer place.“The Open Bug Bounty team is mostly composed of cybersecurity veterans [and] our underlying goal is to bring transparency, efficiency and fairness to the industry.”Open Bug Bounty is run by a small team of maintainers‘Comprehensive’, free serviceNaturally, there’s a gulf in financial resources between Open Bug Bounty and HackerOne and Bugcrowd, whose growth has been propelled by tens of millions of dollars of venture capital investment.“We cannot provide the same elegance of UI/UX or 24/7 support” offered by “the commercial players,” they concede.But they still provide an “comprehensive” service “at no cost” to program owners by marshalling their comparatively modest resources wisely.Catch up on the latest bug bounty newsThey “provide a coordinated and responsible vulnerability disclosure to any website owner” in line with the ISO 29147 standard, but “do not offer any intermediation with the researchers – who always communicate directly with the program owners”.Submissions are limited to common web application vulnerabilities “that are detectable with non-intrusive manual testing”, they add.“For XSS and similar vulnerabilities, we offer free triage and submission verification to bug bounty owners. We do not accept, however, SQL injections and RCEs directly on the platform but provide a central place to coordinate how such findings are to be reported – if authorized by the bug bounty scope.""  Eclectic client baseWhat kind of organizations does the Open Bug Bounty model appeal to? A pretty wide range, according to the platform’s overseers.“We have IT and e-commerce companies, marketplaces, universities, and even some governmental entities hosting their bug bounties at Open Bug Bounty,” say the maintainers.“We regularly receive incoming enquiries from banks and other companies with strict compliance and confidentiality requirements.Some companies host their program on both Open Bug Bounty and a major commercial platform, they add.Without mediation on offer, however, many companies with large budgets “will probably go to commercial platforms to outsource the entire process of vulnerability disclosure and mediation with researchers”.Along with the enforcement of “transparent rules”, the absence of mediation has limited their experience of disputes to “isolated cases”. These issues, mostly stemming from innocent misunderstandings, are mostly “rapidly resolved”.There are infrequent complaints about strictly prohibited instances of automated testing of websites, add the maintainers, and these can lead to swift account suspensions.Nearly one million security vulnerabilities have been disclosed through Open Bug Bounty since 2014Bounties and honor badgesResearchers on the Open Bug Bounty platform earn honor badges to reflect the quality and quantity of their valid submissions, with the emphasis heavier on the former.More tangible rewards can include financial bounties, with some cryptocurrency projects paying five-figure sums, and smart watches, gift cards and other non-financial gifts. Website owners are encouraged to at least express gratitude or write a recommendation on researchers’ profiles for successful submissions.“In our experience, website owners highly appreciate the researchers who come to [their] help and are not solely motivated by a financial reward, and [sometimes] pay small extra bonuses for the most helpful submissions,” say the maintainers.Expanding reporting capabilitiesThe maintainers recently upgraded the email system for notifying organizations of vulnerability submissions, and are “continuously improving” reporting requirements to ensure that submissions from researchers are “sufficiently detailed, clear and actionable.”Reporting capabilities are being expanded to “cover a broader scope of security vulnerabilities” too.The maintainers say they are also open to improvement suggestions from the community and partnerships that can “offer better DevSecOps integrations, assisted remediation and other value-added features”.But with commercial bug bounty vendors increasingly “moving to penetration testing services to increase profits under pressure [from] investors”, Open Bug Bounty will continue to evolve in line with its founding mission: “offering an open, transparent, and fair platform that anyone can join regardless of his or her nationality or number of security certificates”.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/we-are-not-motivated-by-profits-open-bug-bounty-maintainers-on-finding-a-niche-in-the-crowdsourced-appsec-market,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Interviews', 'Hacking', 'News', 'CSRF', 'XSS', 'RCE', 'DevSecOps', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Finance', 'Government', 'E-Commerce', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Education', 'Analysis', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Compliance', 'Enterprise', 'Industry', 'News', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security']"
no,"Ransomware attacks on shipping, logistics organizations rising as coronavirus vaccine supply chain targeted",No honor among thieves,"As the Covid-19 pandemic places increasing strain on the global supply chain, ransomware attacks on the logistics industry have rocketed.A report published today (April 22) by security services provider BlueVoyant finds that last year saw three times as many ransomware attacks on shipping and logistics firms as in 2019.The team also found evidence at most organizations of brute-force attacks, targeted attacks using proxy networks, traffic to blocklisted assets, and traffic coming from known botnets.Time is money“Shipping and logistics companies are large businesses that are highly sensitive to disruption, making them perfect targets for ransomware gangs,” Thomas Lind, BlueVoyant’s co-head of strategic intelligence, tells The Daily Swig.“Any attacker looking for likely targets will be attracted to supply chain companies, which can’t afford to lose any time or access to systems, but which can afford ransoms to get operations back up and running as quickly as possible.”And this has extended to companies involved in Covid-19 vaccine supply chains, with AmeriCold, which provides the specialized cold storage required for the Pfizer vaccine, hit with a ransomware attack last November.Read more of the latest cyber-attack news from around the world“The major eye-openers have been the attack on AmeriCold, which shows that attackers are actively tracing companies involved in vaccine development and distribution,” says Lind.“We already knew this from our recent biotech and pharma report, which showed that attackers were disproportionately targeting vaccine development companies.“But now they’re following the vaccine along supply chain lines, looking for businesses that are vulnerable and can’t afford to have their operations disrupted.”Cybercriminals and fraudsters have been quick to capitalize on the coronavirus pandemicInsufficient protectionBut while every one of the companies surveyed said they’d seen evidence of threats to their network, nine out of ten were found to have open remote desktop or administration ports at IP addresses on their network.Similarly, most showed insufficient email security, lacking basic DNS-based email security protocols – another major vulnerability to ransomware gangs.RECOMMENDED Zero-day vulnerabilities in SonicWall email client led to network access, backdoors installedDomains belonging to 14 of the 20 companies studied had no protection against phishing and spoofing attacks, 16 had devices running unsupported software on their networks, and half appeared to be running software with high-severity vulnerabilities on their servers.These vulnerabilities weren’t concentrated on any one section of the supply chain, with almost every type of business surveyed showing evidence of remote desktop and email vulnerabilities. Shipping businesses, though, tended to be more reliant on outdated technologies.Port in a stormThe single most important move that logistics companies should take, says Lind, is to secure networking ports.“Ransomware gangs don’t hide what they’re doing – they hit remote desktop protocol and other remote desktop ports. Especially in a time when many companies set up remote desktops for remote workers, this is a critical issue,” he says.“Second, use an email service or implement DNS-based email security to protect against phishing attacks.”They should also, he says, make more effort to update and patch software.INSIGHT Covid-19: How bug bounty programs helped secure some of the world’s leading track and trace appsThere is awareness of the problem in the US at least. An executive order signed by Donald Trump aimed at securing maritime shipping, another from Joe Biden in February covered supply chain and logistics, with a particular focus on delivery of Covid vaccines.Meanwhile, points out Lund, “Biden’s infrastructure plan includes provisions for digital security that will doubtless affect supply chain companies”.He added: “They should therefore get ahead of this by engaging with policymakers to identify low-cost, high-impact solutions to their cybersecurity concerns.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ransomware-attacks-on-shipping-logistics-organizations-rising-as-coronavirus-vaccine-supply-chain-targeted,"['Ransomware', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Research', 'Logistics', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Coronavirus', 'Malware', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Government', 'Encryption', 'Passwords', 'Privacy', 'Compliance', 'Analysis', 'Maritime', 'Network', 'Security', 'DNS', 'Email', 'Security', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering']"
no,Valve belatedly fixes Steam gaming platform RCE vulnerability,"One flaw fixed after criticisms about delays, but second longstanding security bug remains unaddressed","Games publisher Valve has belatedly resolved a critical security flaw in its popular Steam platform that it was first notified of two years ago.However, a separate, similarly serious vulnerability first reported to Valve more than a year ago remains unaddressed.A Steam source engine vulnerability discovered by ‘Florian’, a member of reverse engineering group Secret Club, was finally resolved last weekend, nearly two years after it was first reported in May 2019.Malicious game invitesThe patching allowed Florian to go public with a detailed technical blog post explaining how flaws in the platform’s Source engine posed a remote code execution (RCE) risk.An attacker would have been able to use the “Steamworks API in combination with various features and properties of the Source engine to gain remote code execution (RCE) through malicious Steam game invites”, Florian explains.The find, reported through HackerOne, earned Florian an $8,000 payout in October 2020, around the same time a fix was developed for Team Fortress 2.Not game-specific, the CVE-2021-30481 vulnerability potentially affected every title that used the Source engine. Valve only issued a comprehensive fix on April 17.‘Just lazy’As previously reported, another security researcher, Bien Pham, has been waiting for Valve to resolve another flaw that poses a RCE risk for more than a year.The logic bug was reported to Valve on April 2, 2020 through HackerOne. By contrast, Pham reported a server side flaw in Steam earlier this month that was rapidly triaged and earned a $9,000 bug bounty payout.There’s no evidence that the first flaw, much like the vulnerability discovered by Florian, has been exploited by miscreants but Pham is nonetheless frustrated by Valve’s continued lack of action.“I think they are just lazy to fix client-side problems,” Pham told The Daily Swig. “My vulnerability is easy to fix (at least I think it is). When it comes to server, especially their side, they respond quite quickly, so I don't think there should be any reason for them to take a long time to resolve client side bugs.”Catch up on the latest gaming security newsValve is yet to respond to our requests to comment on its apparent slowness in patching vulnerabilities reported to it.Last week, at the time we first reported the issue, HackerOne indicated it had concerns about Valve’s responsiveness, so it’s not too much of a stretch to imagine that it had a quiet word with its client, which might have contributed to it taking action, at least in the case of the older of the two flaws in play.Steam is the world’s most popular video game distribution service, taking up to 75% of the global market share and bringing in around 20 million gamers each day.RECOMMENDED Don’t panic!

no,Don’t panic! DEF CON warrant canary confusion blamed on ‘CMS mistake’,"It ain’t the feds, just gremlins in the system","A recent lapse in DEF CON’s warrant canary being updated on time should not be taken as a sign of a subpoena but was simply due to “human error”, event founder Jeff Moss has confirmed.Earlier this month, some eagle-eyed hackers noted that DEF CON’s warrant canary failed to update as scheduled, leading to fears of potential law enforcement action such as the seizure of servers or sensitive data.A warrant canary is a statement that’s designed to inform people when an organization has been served with a government subpoena.In the US and elsewhere, organizations are routinely prohibited from revealing the existence of a subpoena. As a workaround, warrant canaries typically inform users that there has not been any law enforcement action as of a particular date. It is only when the canary is not updated, or if it is removed completely, that users might infer a subpoena has recently been served.Warrant canaries are found everywhere from libraries to websites and are perhaps most commonly associated with the phrase, ‘The FBI has not been here’.It’s therefore no surprise that when DEF CON’s warrant canary failed to update this month, the hacker rumor mill started turning. That is until event founder Jeff Moss took to Twitter to confirm that everything was in order.“Sorry for the concern about the @defcon warrent [sic] canary everyone,” Moss wrote.“We accidentally clobbered the April 1st canary on April 7th with a CMS sync error. I always thought if something went wrong with our canary it would be human error on our part.”Offering further details, event spokesperson Melanie Ensign told The Daily Swig: “DEF CON added the warrant canary to its site in 2015.

However, due to a lack of file validation, an attacker can upload arbitrary files, including executable code, such as web shells.The blog post reads: “Once uploaded, these branding package ZIP archives are normally expanded and saved to the <SonicWall ES install path>\data\branding directory.“However, an adversary could place malicious files in arbitrary locations, such as a web accessible Apache Tomcat directory, by crafting a ZIP archive containing a file within a sequence of directory traversal notations.”Read more of the latest network security newsAnother vulnerability in the branding feature allowed an adversary to retrieve arbitrary files from the host by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to a particular resource.“While the working directory of this branding feature is <SonicWall ES install path>\data\updates, a directory-traversal vulnerability allows an adversary to access files located outside of this directory.“As the Apache Tomcat webserver handling this request is operating as the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, any file on the operating system can be accessed,” the researchers explained.Combined, the bug trio enabled the creation of a new administrator account on the SonicWall ES device; exposure of hashed passwords for existing, locally configured administrative accounts; the creation of a web shell in an arbitrary directory; and the real-time debugging of exploitation success and failure.Evading detectionAfter gaining access to the administrative details, the attacker harvested credentials in order to move laterally across the network.“The adversary relied on ‘living off the land’ techniques rather than bringing their own tools into the environment, which often has the benefit of potentially avoiding detections from a security product,” the post reads.The attacker was able to access in-memory sensitive credentials and gain access to a file containing daily archived emails processed by SonicWall ES.READ MORE Zero-day vulnerability in SonicWall products actively exploited in the wild“At the time of activity, the victim organization was using the same local Administrator password across multiple hosts in their domain, which provided the adversary an easy opportunity to move laterally under the context of this account – highlighting the value of randomizing passwords to built-in Windows accounts on each host within a domain.“We observed the adversary leveraging Impacket’s publicly available WMIEXEC.PY tool to access several internal hosts, which enabled remote command execution over Microsoft’s DCOM protocol via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).“The adversary managed to briefly perform internal reconnaissance activity prior to being isolated and removed from the environment.”Previous attacksThe recent disclosures are the latest in a series of serious vulnerabilities unearthed in SonicWall products.In January 2021, SonicWall announced it had been the victim of a cyber-assault by “highly sophisticated threat actors”, who targeted vulnerabilities within its SMA 100 Series, a secure remote access client for use in corporate environments.A month later, researchers from NCC Group confirmed that a zero-day bug in the SMA 100 Series was being actively exploited in the wild.DisclosureThe latest vulnerabilities were patched before FireEye went public with its disclosure.SonicWall has advised customers and partners to upgrade to the 10.0.9.6173 hotfix for Windows users, and the 10.0.9.6177 hotfix for hardware and ESXi virtual appliance users.The SonicWall Hosted Email Security product was automatically updated for all customers.The hotfixes will be superseded by the upcoming SonicWall ES 10.0.10 release.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Feds zap Exchange Server backdoors as Microsoft offers patches for further flaws",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-sonicwall-email-client-led-to-network-access-backdoors-installed,"['Zero-day', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Email', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'US', 'Ransomware', 'Passwords', 'Industry', 'News', 'Path', 'Traversal', 'Windows', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Authentication', 'Research', 'Organizations']"
no,"Telecoms industry facing increased DDoS attacks, report warns",New research from Cloudflare details cyber-attack trends of 2021 so far,"The telecommunications industry is facing an increased threat of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, according to a new report.Cloudflare’s new research, released earlier this week, details DDoS attacks and trends for the first quarter of 2021.In the findings, the web infrastructure and security company notes that the telecommunications industry was the most targeted sector in the first three months of the year.The sector made a “significant” jump from sixth place in Q4 2020 to become the number-one DDoS target in Q1 2021, followed by the consumer services industry, and the security and investigations industry.‘Major disruption’Cloudflare’s latest report is based on data taken from the company’s own DDoS mitigation platform that serves approximately 25 million users.It found that January was Q1’s busiest month for attacks, constituting 42% of the total attacks observed in the quarter, followed by March with 34.2%, and February with 23.8%.February itself saw the quarter’s largest attack, when Cloudflare observed one packet-flooding assault that clocked 300-400 gigabits per second (Gbps).Read more of the latest DDoS attack newsIn the first quarter of the year, a vast majority (over 97%) of the attacks observed were smaller than one million packets per second and 500 megabits per second (Mbps).“This is a continuation of the trend we observed all of last year. However, this does not imply that these attacks are harmless,” the report reads.It added: “Attacks under 500 Mbps are often sufficient to create major disruptions for internet properties that are not protected by a cloud-based DDoS protection service.“Many organizations have uplinks provided by their service providers with less bandwidth capacity than 1 Gbps.“Assuming their public-facing network interface also serves legitimate traffic, you can see how even DDoS attacks under 500 Mbps can easily take down internet properties.”Trend watchIn the study, Cloudflare researchers also found that most DDoS attacks in the first quarter originated in China, with the nation bumping India from the dubious top spot.Perhaps unsurprisingly given the size of the economy, Chinese enterprises were also subject to the most DDoS attacks in the same period.RELATED Ransom-related DDoS attacks rise from the dead as attack vectors diversifyThere was also a slight dip in the proportion of DDoS victims who received a ransom demand and promise to halt the assault upon payment, down from 17% to 13% year on year.Another trend Cloudflare continues to see in 2021 is “the continued use of the new QUIC protocol for attacks,” Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cumming told The Daily Swig.The British software engineer added: “There was [also] a large increase in attacks using Jenkins and TeamSpeak3 servers.

no,Researchers trick Duo 2FA into sending authentication request to attacker-controlled device,"Something you know, something you hack","UPDATED Penetration testers were able to bypass Duo Security’s two-factor authentication (2FA) controls during a client engagement after using a neat but certainly not threatening hack.Shaun Kammerling and Michael Kruger of Orange Cyberdefense’s SensePost team discovered that, providing an attacker had access to a user’s login details and 2FA credentials, it was possible to log into a different user’s account without physical access to the victim’s authentication device.The trick only worked with two accounts on the same Duo deployment, but the researchers were able to redirect a victim’s 2FA push notifications to an attacker-controlled device, which allowed them to authorize access to the victim account.The vulnerability arises because of deficiencies in how session information is managed during 2FA using Duo’s technology.Bypassing authenticationThe SensePost team reported the issue to Duo in December 2020, and the security vendor acted promptly to resolve the problem.Months went by to allow the changes to bed in, and the potential impact of the problem to be assessed, before both Duo and the researchers went public with details of the issue.In an advisory, Duo explained the root cause of the problem:When a user authenticated with a second factor, the state representing that authentication was not tied to the current user’s session. Therefore, an attacker could reuse state information from a successful second factor authentication to bypass the two-factor authentication requirement of another user.Duo Security, a Cisco Systems owned business since 2018, fixed the problem on December 15, 2020, just a day after it was reported. The fix came in automatically, so customers didn’t have to do anything.‘No malicious activity’A subsequent audit by Duo “found no evidence of any customer impact stemming from this issue”.“Apart from verifying researcher testing, we identified one instance out of billions of authentication events where this issue may have been encountered, and, upon further investigation, have no indication this was a result of malicious activity,” it said.Full technical details can be found on the Orange Cyberdefense blog.In response to questions from The Daily Swig about the 2FA bypass find, Sensepost's Leon Jacobs offered a short synopsis.""In short there was a state issue tying a user's session with a 2FA attempt,"" Jacobs explained.

Or if they chose to disclose vulnerabilities in that vendor’s products, consider doing it anonymously or with some other protection in place.”Speaking to The Daily Swig, researcher Sick Codes, who alongside Jericho and Casey John Ellis maintains the repo, said the move to GitHub was made to give both researchers and organizations the opportunity to both upload and change information, something that “wouldn’t have happened” on the original website.Research Threats is a ‘collection of over-reactions, demands, and cease and desist letters’Judge or jury?Research Threats offers a timeline of notable vulnerability disclosure incidents from 2006 up to the present day, including descriptions of the legal threat and how it was resolved, if at all.It also has a ‘goodies’ folder, in which researchers can upload copies of correspondence they have received from companies or lawyers acting on their behalf.Anyone can make pull requests to change the information in this growing database, creating a level playing field for all parties involved.Making the timeline open source also improves its accuracy, reducing the risk of misreporting cases, according to Sick Codes.Read more of the latest security industry newsThe security researcher told The Daily Swig: “I’m not the judge and jury on any of these situations because, you know, people could lie and say they got a letter, but they were actually doing something bad… and that’s one of the issues we considered when we were thinking about like, should we put a time limit [on how long information can be changed] of like a month or something?“And then we were like, that’s not really appropriate either because things could happen fast or slow.“That’s why [we] put it up on GitHub so that people can actually project or review it [to] say well, besides this is not right, this is true… Anyway, it’s an experiment.”RELATED Security researcher launches GoFundMe campaign to fight legal threat over vulnerability disclosureJericho added: “My big thing is trying to remain as factual and neutral as possible. They (organizations) are already being called out under the banner of ‘wrong choice assholes’, in so many words, so the summary of their company incident is brief and to the point, with backing documentation.“The idea was more around ‘you are on notice, researchers are now aware of your tactics, this isn’t good for anyone’.“But, since the damage is done, they won’t be removed. If they backpedaled on a threat and gave us info, I would update to include that. So I think it does serve as a warning of sorts, but it isn’t meant to ‘punish’ the company.”Making safer decisionsCasey John-Ellis agreed with Jericho, telling The Daily Swig that the repo was formed “to encourage folks to aggregate verified interactions where vulnerability reporting has proven to be legally unsafe”.“The hope is for security researchers to be able to use this to make safer decisions, and for organizations to understand better what kinds of things they ought not to do when someone approaches them offering legitimate help – an ideal world would be where this type of interaction is a very normal, neutral, and expected part of being on the internet, but unfortunately, we still have a ways to go there,” they said.“The open source element adds an additional layer of transparency and makes the right of reply easier. Both of these are important for objectivity, and for keeping information up to date.”Changing attitudesResearch Threats contains guidance for both researchers and organizations on how to work together in a “perfect” coordinated disclosure.Regarding the timeline, Sick Codes said that having the information displayed in such a way shows the historical changes of certain companies attitudes towards ethical hacking.Notable incidents in the list include two entries in 2008 when Apple was accused of cancelling talks at Black Hat, one due to a non-disclosure agreement, and another apparently due to the apprehension from the company’s marketing team.Sick Codes told The Daily Swig many companies won’t appear twice: “Once they fix up the policy and get everything sorted out, especially getting a proper vulnerability disclosure policy with safe harbor and that sort of stuff involved, where it strictly says, like Apple’s one [policy] which says, ‘this supersedes every other violation as long as you report it to Apple’.”Recent casesWhile the project may demonstrate changing attitudes from companies such as Apple and Google, the repo may also serve as a reality check for organizations who are thinking of taking legal action following the private disclosure of vulnerabilities.The most recent entry relates to an incident previously reported by The Daily Swig, during which security researcher Rob Dyke said he was served with a legal notice after a vulnerability disclosure went sour.This incident has still not been resolved, as Dyke detailed in a blog post, leading the security researcher to pre-emptively crowdsource his potential legal fees.This article has been updated to include further commentYOU MAY ALSO LIKE Pressure grows on Valve to unplug steam gaming platform vulnerabilities",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/when-vulnerability-disclosure-goes-sour-github-repo-details-legal-threats-and-risks-faced-by-ethical-hackers,"['Legal', 'Industry', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Organizations', 'UK', 'Apple', 'Cybercrime', 'Secure', 'Development', 'VDP', 'GitHub', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Censorship', 'Compliance', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Government', 'Healthcare', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Black', 'Hat', 'Pen', 'Testing']"
no,Behind the Great Firewall: Chinese cyber-espionage adapts to post-Covid world with stealthier attacks,"Beijing adopting supply chain tactics and greater sharing of resources between spying groups, experts warn","ANALYSIS China’s long-established cyber-threat groups have been building up a huge arsenal of resources, comprising both publicly available and customized tools, and diversifying their repertoire amid the coronavirus pandemic.Threat intelligence experts quizzed by The Daily Swig said that Chinese state-sponsored attackers are at the forefront of developing new or novel hacking techniques.For example, supply chain attacks have long been a method of compromise by China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) groups on different targets, predating the now-infamous SolarWinds attacks supposedly pulled off by Russian threat actors last year.The latest annual threat assessment (PDF) from the US intelligence community, presented to Congress this week, warns that “China presents a prolific and effective cyber-espionage threat, possesses substantial cyber-attack capabilities, and presents a growing influence threat”.“China’s cyber-espionage operations have included compromising telecommunications firms, providers of managed services and broadly used software, and other targets potentially rich in follow-on opportunities for intelligence collection, attack, or influence operations,” the intel agencies warn.What kind of organizations are being targeted?Chinese government-backed threat groups are said to be among some of the most prolific and well-resourced in the world.The country’s cyber-espionage operations historically had a reputation for “preferring smash-and-grab over sophistication”, but this has changed over recent years, according to Marc Burnard, senior information security researcher at Secureworks.Paul Prudhomme, head of threat intelligence advisory at IntSights, agreed that China had become a top-tier cyber adversary for Western businesses and governments.“Chinese cyber-espionage groups are among the most sophisticated in the world, but are not as sophisticated as their Russian counterparts,” Prudhomme told The Daily Swig.“Advanced features of Chinese cyber-espionage attacks have included the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, the execution of supply chain and third-party attacks, and the use of proprietary or custom malware and other tools.”INSIGHT Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to know“Chinese cyber-attacks have nonetheless often had weaknesses in their operational security that have enabled security researchers to attribute them to Chinese actors,” Prudhomme added.Morgan Wright, chief security advisor at SentinelOne, and a former US State Department special advisor, told The Daily Swig that China is far more deliberate than Russia in its execution of cyber-attacks.“Russia has moved from being more covert to more overt in the last few years,” Wright explained. “China, on the other hand, takes time to evaluate progress, identify follow-up tasks, and even develop specific modules depending on the type of machine being attacked.”Beijing goes beyond technical measures, for example by using social networks and other OSINT channels for early-stage reconnaissance.“[Chinese] intelligence services routinely use LinkedIn and conferences as means to establish relationships that are later exploited in spear-phishing attacks used to gain an initial foothold inside targeted entities,” Wright said.Chinese APT groups are employing the gamut of tactics, techniques, and procedures against their targetsWhy is China involved in cyber-espionage?Chinese-associated threat actors typically conduct cyber-espionage operations to gather information in support of wider economic goals such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the ‘Made in China 2025’ program. Part of this involves spying on foreign governments.They also seek competitive intelligence on the foreign business rivals of Chinese companies in many different industries, according to threat intel experts quizzed by The Daily Swig.Other geopolitical developments also influence China-linked cyber-espionage operations. These include China’s trade war with the US, its dispute in the South China Sea with other ASEAN countries, and most recently the coronavirus pandemic.For initial infiltration, spear-phishing is the current favored tactic amongst these groups.Chinese threat actors employ the gamut of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), but the most common campaigns include spear-phishing, carrying out watering hole attacks and strategic web compromise operations, compromising shared services (such as managed service providers and telecommunications networks), and using supply chain compromises.Chinese attacks have become more focused and targeted over recent years, moving away from the high volume, unfocused pattern of older attacks.“Ten years ago, Chinese espionage operators were not as specific about their desired targets and would compromise the websites of major news sites and high-profile industry-focused organizations in an attempt to distribute malware to all visitors to these pages,” according to Frederick Plan, senior analyst of cyber-espionage at Mandiant Intelligence.Read more of the latest cybercrime news from around the world“More recently, however, Chinese groups are generally more nuanced and more choosey with their targets so they will rely on whitelisting or spear-phishing of specific individuals in a targeted organization.”The use of software security vulnerabilities is also popular with Chinese APTs.Natalie Page, threat intelligence analyst at Talion, said: “In October 2020, the National Security Agency published a report detailing 25 publicly known high severity vulnerabilities being utilised by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, way after patches had been made publicly available.”“For initial infiltration, highly targeted spear-phishing is seemingly the current favoured tactic amongst these groups,” Page added.The Chinese government has been linked to some of the most infamous cyber-threat groupsWhat attacks have been linked to Chinese spying groups?Chinese APT groups have been blamed for some of the most infamous cybercrime campaigns ever witnessed.Prolific threat groups with alleged links to Beijing include Axiom (APT72), Deep Panda (APT19), Elderwood (APT17), Ke3chang (APT15), Mustang Panda, menuPass (APT10), PalmerWorm, and Winnti (APT41).The overriding motivation of these group is heavily tied to the Chinese government and espionage activities, though some have also been linked to financial crimes.How are Chinese APT groups organized?Historically, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) spearheaded Chinese cyber-espionage, but over more recent years the Ministry of State Security (MSS) has become more important than the country’s armed forces.Charity Wright, a former NSA Chinese espionage expert turned threat researcher at Recorded Future, told The Daily Swig: “I would say post-2015, MSS is dominating the cyber-espionage game.“PLA reformed in 2015 to focus on warfighting. 2016, MSS split into two agencies with more defined objectives.”A growing body of evidence points to greater knowledge sharing between Chinese groups.Mandiant Intelligence’s Plan explained: “Shifts in their TTPs include an increasing reliance on publicly available tools (such as CobaltStrike BEACON) and more frequent use of malware that is shared among multiple groups.”“We believe that increased sharing between groups is indicative of a kind of standardization of operations across distinct actors,” Plan concluded.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/behind-the-great-firewall-chinese-cyber-espionage-adapts-to-post-covid-world-with-stealthier-attacks,"['Cyber', 'Warfare', 'China', 'Network', 'Security', 'Phishing', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Coronavirus', 'Government', 'Industry', 'News', 'Asia', 'Analysis', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Privacy', 'Malware', 'Ransomware', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Microsoft', 'OSINT', 'Fraud', 'Legal', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Russia', 'US', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'Spyware', 'Surveillance', 'IoT', 'Telecommunications']"
no,Cisco router flaws left small business networks open to abuse,Complexity to exploit authentication bypass bug ‘very low’,"Cisco has patched two vulnerabilities in its RV34X series of small business-focused routers that could have been exploited separately or chained together to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE).The authentication bypass and system command injection vulnerabilities, both in the RV34X web management interface, would have allowed a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands or bypass authentication and upload files on an affected device.Cisco has issued an advisory for the vulnerabilities, which received a CVSS score of 7.3.Scanning the attack surfaceThe issues were uncovered by security firm IoT Inspector after an automated analysis uncovered some “promising” potential vulnerabilities, which were later confirmed and explored.Complexity to exploit the vulnerability is “very low”, Florian Lukavsky, managing director of IoT Inspector, told The Daily Swig.The first vulnerability – CVE-2021-1473 – could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.Insufficient validation of user input meant that an attacker could send malicious requests to an affected device and run arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.READ MORE Surge in malware and cyber-attacks set to continue, Europol warns in SOCTA 2021 reportMeanwhile, a bypass file upload vulnerability, CVE-2021-1472, was caused by improper session management on affected devices.It could be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the device, and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and upload files to directories that should require administrative permissions.This could include the reading of any configuration settings, including users' password hashes, as well as the ability to change passwords.Inside the perimeter“If the attacker can escalate his local privileges, reading or intercepting any traffic routed via the device would be possible too,” according to Lukavsky.“The impact of the vulnerability mainly depends on the context of the router, environmental parameters, and how exposed the web interface is.“If the web interface was accessible from a public guest network, for example, the potential impact will be higher than if it was only accessible via a restricted management network.”Read more of the latest information security researchThe initial disclosure was made on February 2 this year, with Cisco confirming that the issue was valid on 27 February. The advisory was released on 7 April.“Cisco’s PSIRT [Product Security Incident Response Team] is very well organized and they follow established vulnerability disclosure processes,” says Lukavsky. “We had a very positive and professional experience throughout the disclosure process.”Currently, says Lukavsky, the issue appears to be confined to the RV34X series of routers.“However, we did not heavily investigate how many other devices may be affected by this issue,” he says.“On the other hand, we found additional issues in the same series and other vulnerabilities in other Cisco products, which are still in the fixing process.

no,Feds zap Exchange Server backdoors as Microsoft offers patches for further flaws,Trouble comes in twos,"A US court action has authorized government authorities to remove backdoors from compromised Microsoft Exchange servers.From the start of the year until at least March 2, when Microsoft issued patches, hacking groups exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server software to access email accounts and place web shells in order to maintain persistent access to compromised systems.In an unusual move, the FBI was granted authority to remove these web shells (which acted like backdoors) from hacked Microsoft Exchange installations.Removing the web shells entailed the interference of a third-party computer, which might be ruled unlawful without the recent court order.RECOMMENDED Capcom ransomware attack: Hackers gained access via vulnerable VPN, report findsThis action only deals with part of the problem because compromised systems will still need to be patched, even before further remedial steps can be implemented to detect compromises, restore systems, and expel attackers.Is therefore best considered as phase one in an ongoing clean-up operation.“The FBI conducted the removal by issuing a command through the web shell to the server, which was designed to cause the server to delete only the web shell (identified by its unique file path),” a US Department of Justice (DoJ) statement explains.The statement goes on to discuss the copy (presumably for forensic purposes) and removal of web shells from hundreds of vulnerable computers.Assistant Attorney General John Demers for the DoJ’s National Security Division, commented: “The court-authorized removal of the malicious web shells demonstrates the Department’s commitment to disrupt hacking activity using all of our legal tools, not just prosecutions.”IncomingNews of the court-authorized clean-up operation came on Tuesday (April 13), just hours before Microsoft announced separate patches to address two new Exchange Server vulnerabilities.Both flaws (tracked as CVE-2021-28480 and CVE-2021-28481) pose a remote code execution risk to unpatched systems.Worse yet, both security bugs are unauthenticated and require no user interaction, with each qualifying for a critical 9.8 CVSS index score that’s perilously close to the maximum.Dustin Childs of Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative, commented: “Since the attack vector is listed as ‘Network’, it is likely these bugs are wormable – at least between Exchange servers.”Read more of the latest hacking news from around the worldChilds continued: “The CVSS score for these two bugs is actually higher than the Exchange bugs exploited earlier this year.“These bugs were credited to the National Security Agency.

no,Inference attacks: How much information can machine learning models leak?,Academics warn that user privacy may fall at the hands of little-known attack vector,"The widespread adoption of machine learning models in different applications has given rise to a new range of privacy and security concerns.Among them are ‘inference attacks’, whereby attackers cause a target machine learning model to leak information about its training data.However, these attacks are not very well understood and we need to readjust our definitions and expectations of how they can affect our privacy.This is according to researchers from several academic institutions in Australia and India who made the warning in a new paper (PDF) accepted at the IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy, which will be held in September.The paper was jointly authored by researchers at the University of New South Wales; Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani; Macquarie University; and the Cyber & Electronic Warfare Division, Defence Science and Technology Group, Australia.Membership and attribute inference attacksMachine learning models are trained on thousands of data records. In many cases, these datasets might contain sensitive information such as names, birth dates, addresses, passwords, credit card numbers, health data, and other personal details.Inference attacks aim to reveal this secret information by probing a machine learning model with different input data and weighing the output.There are different types of inference attacks. Membership inference (MI) is a type of attack in which the adversary tries to rebuild the records used to train the model.YOU MAY LIKE Going deep: How advances in machine learning can improve DDoS attack detectionIn membership inference, the attacker runs one or more records through a machine learning model and determines whether it belonged to the training dataset based on the model’s output.In general, machine learning models output stronger confidence scores when they are fed with their training examples, as opposed to new and unseen examples.Another type of inference attack is attribute inference (AI), in which an attacker has partial knowledge of a training record and tries to guess the missing attributes by tweaking them until the model reaches its peak performance.Strong membership inferencePrevious research in the field shows that membership and attribute inference can be combined to rebuild a target machine learning model’s training dataset.But in their paper, ‘On the (In)Feasibility of Attribute Inference Attacks on Machine Learning Models’, the researchers show that combining membership and attribute inference is more complicated than was previously thought – and even if a target model is susceptible to MI attacks, AI attacks on the same model will not necessarily work.For such attacks to succeed, the attackers must be able to perform strong membership inference (SMI), the researchers write.Plain membership inference techniques tend to confuse member examples with non-members when their attributes are close enough.In contrast, SMI is a technique that can tell a difference between a member and non-members that are very similar to it.Read more of the latest machine learning newsThe researchers argue that “a successful MI attack does not necessarily mean a successful SMI attack” and that “a successful SMI attack is essential for an AI attack.”Reciprocally, the researchers’ findings show that if a target model is not susceptible to SMI attacks, standalone AI attacks will not succeed on it either.The researchers tested five known model inference attacks on several different machine learning architectures, including neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and logistic regression.Their results show that “while these attacks are successful to infer membership, they are ineffective in inferring membership at distances close to the training dataset (SMI).”Approximate attribute inferenceIn the paper, the researchers also propose approximate attribute inference (AAI), a more relaxed notion of AI in which the adversary tries to find values that are in the close vicinity of the target attributes. AAI attacks are more feasible than AI attacks on models, according to the researchers.“It is possible to infer attributes approximately close to their true values with a success rate significantly greater than random guess when the target model is susceptible to membership inference,” the researchers write.READ Prototype pollution: The dangerous and underrated vulnerability impacting JavaScript applicationsAAI attacks also become increasingly accurate when the target machine learning has been overfitted, the researchers have found.Overfitting happens when the engineers of a machine learning model have too few training examples or run the training procedure for too long.This results in the model being very accurate of the training examples and not accurate enough on novel examples.Implications for machine learning securityMachine learning engineers want to constantly protect their models against different types of security and privacy threats.The researchers’ work shows that in applications where the main privacy concern is AI and not MI, developers can make use of the paper’s findings to better protect their models.“As a future direction, it will be interesting to explore whether the approximate attribute inference attacks mentioned in this paper can be improved to infer missing attributes as close as possible to the original attributes,” the researchers write.The Daily Swig reached out to the authors for comments on their work.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Adversarial attacks against machine learning systems – everything you need to know",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/inference-attacks-how-much-information-can-machine-learning-models-leak,"['Machine', 'Learning', 'Research', 'Privacy', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Analysis', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Education', 'Australia', 'India', 'Asia', 'Oceania', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cyber-attacks', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'AI']"
no,Pressure grows on Valve to unplug Steam gaming platform vulnerabilities,"Two-year-old RCE flaws still unpatched, bounty hunters claim","UPDATED Pressure is growing on games publisher Valve after two sets of security researchers came forward with complaints that it has been slow at resolving security flaws in its popular Steam platform.A seemingly critical Steam source engine vulnerability discovered by ‘Florian’, a member of reverse engineering group Secret Club, and dating from 2019 is said to remain unresolved – much to the consternation of the individual involved and his security research colleagues.Florian reported the flaw to Valve through a bug bounty program run by HackerOne, but despite multiple attempts to chase the issue no action has been taken, even though the security flaw was “verified/triaged after a couple of months”, according to the bug hunter.Secret Club aired its frustration in a Twitter update over the weekend: “Two years ago, Secret Club member @floesen_ reported a remote code execution (RCE) flaw affecting all source engine games.RECOMMENDED Capcom ransomware attack: Hackers gained access via vulnerable VPN“It can be triggered through a Steam invite,” the group added. “This has yet to be patched, and Valve is preventing us from publicly disclosing it.”A tracker for the issue – CVE-2021-30481 – was been added to NIST’s National Vulnerability database on Monday (April 12).“Valve Steam through 2021-04-10, when a Source engine game is installed, allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code because of a buffer overflow that occurs for a Steam invite after one click,” the entry states.Letting off SteamSeparately this week, another security researcher, Bien Pham, voiced his concerns that a flaw he reported in Steam also poses a remote code execution risk.This, too, he says, has been “ignored by Valve for a year”.“RCE can be achieved by connecting to a malicious server, then the chain will be completed when game is restarted,” Singapore-based Pham said on a message on Twitter.In response to follow-up questions from The Daily Swig, Pham confirmed the second flaw remained unresolved but declined to go into details, beyond describing it as a “logic bug”.Read more of the latest gaming security newsThe researcher – who added he was “pretty sure” the flaw was different from that discovered by Florian – said there was no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability, but nonetheless criticised Valve for its apparent inaction.“The reason why Valve delayed their response for a long time, I think because of [HackerOne] policy allows vendors to hold the report indefinitely. And Valve, they rely on security through obscurity,” Pham said.The Daily Swig contacted Valve’s PR team for comment via a form on the gaming publisher’s website.No word back as yet, but we’ll update this story as and when more information comes to hand. in response to questions from The Daily Swig, HackerOne offered the following comment.“It’s our policy not to comment on customer programs without their consent,"" HackerObe said.

Meanwhile, criminals are employing new business models, such as the rental of cybercrime skills and tools or profit-sharing deals.“The availability of cybercrime services online as part of a crime-as-a-service business model makes cybercrime more accessible by lowering the technical expertise required to carry out these crimes,” he said.“Critical infrastructure will continue to be targeted by cybercriminals, which poses significant risks. Developments such as the expansion of the Internet of Things and the increase use of artificial intelligence will have a significant impact.”RECOMMENDED Enter the Matrix: Secure communications network hits 30 million user milestoneOther areas of concern for Europol include the increasing number of applications for biometrics data, along with deepfakes and the availability of autonomous vehicles.Meanwhile, European Commissioner for home affairs Ylva Johansson called for more powers to access electronic evidence, adding that the bloc was considering taking action to ensure that service providers retained data so that it could be accessed by law enforcement.Read more of the latest cybercrime news from around the world“We must also deal with encryption,” she added. “Criminals hide their crimes with encryption that’s easy to use but impossible to break.

no,Covid-19 pandemic: How bug bounty programs helped secure some of the world’s leading track and trace apps,"Crowdsourced security was a key tool in securing some countries’ efforts, while others missed the mark","As the Covid-19 pandemic began spreading across the globe in 2020, governments worldwide raced to develop tracking apps to help contain the virus.The list of countries with track and trace apps is exhaustive, with the UK, France, India, Australia, China, and Hong Kong just some of those included.But as is often the case, the rush to push projects out in a short amount of time came at the expense of user security and privacy.Read more of the latest news about bug bounty programsNotable issues, of those that have been publicly reported, include major privacy holes and the leaking of sensitive data in some cases.As a result, last year saw the launch of a number of bug bounty programs and vulnerability disclosure programs (VDPs) specifically designed to secure track and trace applications.Securing the worldThe World Health Organization (WHO) launched its VDP in conjunction with HackerOne in December 2020, asking white hats to look for flaws in its mobile app.It was one of the first high profile programs to be announced and, to date, has resulted in the patching of seven security vulnerabilities uncovered by ethical hackers.HackerOne also worked with the UK’s Department of Health and Social Care to launch a VDP for the NHS track and trace app and its supporting infrastructure.A number of “wide ranging” security flaws were reported during a pilot test of the app, according to a report from Australian security researchers Dr Chris Culnane and Vanessa Teague.These security failings, as detailed in this blog post, included various TLS server implementation issues that could lead to the leaking of unencrypted data, spoofing false positive test results, and other issues.The UK’s signals intelligence agency GCHQ said all security and privacy issues were fixed prior to the national rollout of the app.BACKGROUND Contact tracing bug bounty: France’s StopCovid project launches public programAcross the channel, the French government employed European bug bounty platform YesWeHack to run its bug bounty program for tracing app StopCovid.In contrast to other government-funded programs, which are unpaid VDPs, white hat hackers are offered monetary awards up to €2,000 (around $2,300) for critical vulnerabilities (as well as a free t-shirt) under this scheme.The program has so far confirmed 35 reports, though in response to questions from The Daily Swig, the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) declined to give any detail on the types of bugs uncovered.A screenshot of the NHS track and trace appMandatory privacy riskWhile many government-funded tracing apps were somewhat optional (venues could request the use of the app before entry at their discretion), in India it was mandatory. Indian citizens couldn’t ride a bus, for example, without checking into the app.Making the app compulsory was initially a move designed to protect Indian citizens from exposure to disease, though combined with a raft of major security holes, it also left them vulnerable to other risks.Baptiste Robert, a French security researcher known online as Elliot Alderson, whose extensive experience testing Indian websites and apps has earned him a reputation across India, was one of the first to report issues with India’s Aarogtu Setu app.RELATED The age of Covid-19: Lockdowns and cybersecurity, 12 months onThe contract tracing application was launched in April 2020, bringing with it major privacy blunders, as Robert discovered.The app allowed users to view how many people were infected within a limited radius, however Robert was able to subvert this functionality and use it to put a microscope on what was happening at specific locations.Robert proved his concept by combining the two security flaws to pinpoint the number of infected people within India’s prime minister’s office.‘A lot of issues’Robert told The Daily Swig that there was no bug bounty program for the app when it launched, and that he was only able to conduct his research due to a good relationship with India’s government.“For, let’s say, ‘normal people’, it can be super complicated to disclose something [without a bug bounty program], especially in India. You can have a lot of issues, but for me it was okay.”Robert said he pushed the government to create a bug bounty program, instead it decided to make the application open source – though even this move drew criticism due to the fact that its codebase wasn’t actually publicly available in full.The researcher said: “I tried to push the Indian government to open source their application and say, okay, this is something people have the right to know, what is inside the Aarogaya Setu app. So they decided to open source the application, but in reality, it was not really open source.”A report from the Internet Freedom Foundation noted that GitHub users “have commented that the source code provided on the official GitHub release does not match the actual version of the app, which is available for the users to download and use”.“In other words, the researchers and developers cannot contribute to the process because they have not even been given the actual code to work with!”Demonstrating trustSo far in 2021, the Indian government has not yet fully open sourced the app. But in other countries, small wins can be found in their attitude towards crowdsourced security.Commenting on bug bounty programs, a spokesperson from YesWeHack told The Daily Swig:“Governments need to protect citizens’ data in order to minimize the risk of malicious acts, and bug bounty allows real in-depth security – bug bounty [programs] allow [researchers] to confront an application in real conditions, with different approaches and methodologies.”They added: “Users are today arguing strongly for transparency and security from digital players and governments and having your application tested by thousands of researchers demonstrates your transparency and respect for your users.”YOU MAY LIKE Microsoft Teams is the first target for new app-focused bug bounty program",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/covid-19-pandemic-how-bug-bounty-programs-helped-secure-some-of-the-worlds-leading-track-and-trace-apps,"['Coronavirus', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Vulnerabilities', 'VDP', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Privacy', 'Government', 'UK', 'India', 'France', 'Europe', 'Analysis', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'GitHub']"
no,Pwn2Own 2021: Zero-click Zoom exploit among winners as payout record smashed,"$1m payout barrier broken by attacks also targeting Microsoft Exchange, Windows 10","The flagship Pwn2Own live hacking event has broken new ground on two fronts after total payouts surpassed $1 million and the competition’s first-ever solo female contestant notched a victory.Some 23 participating teams and lone security researchers collectively earned a record $1,210,000 from a total prize pool of $1,500,000 over the three-day event, which is organized by Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).The contest concluded yesterday with a three-way tie for the coveted Master of Pwn crown, with Team DEVCORE, security researcher ‘OV’, and Daan Keuper and Thijs Alkemade from Dutch infosec firm Computest sharing top spot on the leaderboard with 20 Master of Pwn points apiece.Pwn2Own’s 14th annual edition also featured a new category, with enterprise communications joining web browser, virtualization, server, and local escalation of privilege categories split between 10 targets.First-time female triumphThe competition’s first-ever solo female contestant, Alisa Esage Shevchenko, leveraged ASCII art in a guest-to-host escape on Parallels Desktop, which netted her two Master of Pwn points for, owing to pre-competition disclosure, a ‘partial’ victory.Taking to Twitter afterwards, the researcher declared herself “super hyped” at fulfilling “a major goal personally” after the “zero day Hypervisor VM Escape exploit on Mac, one of the first in the world, I think”.Exchange takeoverThe event’s second consecutive virtual edition (the event is ordinarily an in-person affair held in Vancouver, Canada) kicked off with eight successful entries.Most notably, eventual Masters of Pwn ‘OV’ and DEVCORE both earned $200,000 prizes – the former for a two-bug chain in Microsoft Teams leading to code execution, the latter for an authentication bypass and local privilege escalation to seize control of the Microsoft Exchange server.Fellow overall winners Daan Keuper and Thijs Alkemade also then earned the same amount the following day after deploying a three-bug chain to achieve zero-click code execution on Zoom Messenger.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsAlso among 11 successful entries on day two was a type mismatch bug leveraged by Bruno Keith and Niklas Baumstark of Dataflow Security to exploit the renderer in Google Chrome and Chromium-based Microsoft Edge, earning the pair $100,000.The third and final day saw Benjamin McBride of L3Harris Trenchant, ‘Da Lao’, and Marcin Wiazowski earn $40,000 and four Master of Pwn points apiece for, respectively, a memory corruption bug leading to code execution on Parallels Desktop’ host OS, an OOB Write to achieve a guest-to-host escape in Parallels, and a use-after-free bug to escalate to SYSTEM on Windows 10.‘Hard to choose’Asked for his favorite exploit, Brian Gorenc, senior director of vulnerability research and head of ZDI at Trend Micro, told The Daily Swig: “It’s hard to choose between the Microsoft Exchange exploit and the 0-day Zoom demonstration. Both show amazing research and impact targets with millions of users.”The event was streamed live on YouTube, Twitch, and the conference site, while the ZDI blog features a blow-by-blow account of how the exploit attempts unfolded.Participating vendors now have 90 days to produce fixes for reported vulnerabilities before public disclosure.Pwn2Own Vancouver 2020, which was hastily migrated to a virtual format last year with the Covid-19 pandemic in its early stages, was won by returning champions Richard Zhu and Amat Cama of Team Fluoroacetate after taking control of Adobe Reader and the Windows kernel via a pair of use-after-free bugs.Amid the global vaccine rollout, Gorenc said it was unclear when a return to an in-person contest might be possible, “but our goal is to take the best of what we’re doing in the virtual format (remote participation, live streaming, real-time interviews, etc.) and combine it with a physical contest for a hybrid event”.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/pwn2own-2021-zero-click-zoom-exploit-among-winners-as-payout-record-smashed,"['Events', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'Canada', 'Russia', 'Edge', 'Netherlands', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Microsoft', 'Authentication', 'Browsers', 'Network', 'Security', 'RCE', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Coronavirus', 'Apple', 'Google', 'Chrome', 'Windows', 'Adobe', 'YouTube']"
no,Critical GravCMS vulnerability offers lessons for software developers,Vulnerability in content management system opened the door to unauthenticated exploitation,"A recently resolved vulnerability in GravCMS created a means for unauthenticated attackers to hijack admin functions on vulnerable content management systems, among other potential exploits.The critical flaw, which posed a remote code execution (RCE) risk, was discovered by Mehmet Ince during a penetration test last month and subsequently reported to both the client and developers of GravCMS.The flaw – tracked as CVE-2021-21425 – was resolved on 6 April 2021, allowing the security researcher to publish a technical write-up of his main findings.Users are advised to upgrade to GetGrav 1.10.8, a patched version of the software release earlier this week, in order to guard against potential pwnage.According to public data, there are around 20,000 websites that use GravCMS, a PHP-based open source package.Unauthenticated exploitation riskInce discovered that in earlier versions of the software, an unauthenticated user could execute some methods of administrative control without needing any credentials because of flaws in the coding of the Grav Admin Plugin.“Particular method execution will result in arbitrary YAML file creation or content change of existing YAML files on the system,” Ince told The Daily Swig.“Successfully exploitation of that vulnerability results in configuration changes, such as general site information change, custom scheduler job definition, etc.”“Due to the nature of the vulnerability, an adversary can change some part of the webpage, or hijack an administrator account, or execute operating system command under the context of the web-server user,” Ince added.The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.10.8. Blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources can be applied as a workaround.Matias Griese, a developer on the core GravCMS team, commented: “Admin 1.10.8 prevents the described attack, and the next version should make it impossible to use the methods described in the article to find another way in.”Lessons to be learnedIstanbul-based Ince told The Daily Swig that the discovery of the flaw offered lessons for other software developers.“The root cause of that vulnerability is related to the method invocation design of the GrabCMS controllers,” Ince explained.“A very basic mistake about naming one of the methods made the whole attack possible. In other words, one critical method of the class has become accessible via HTTP without authentication just because of basic mistakes.”The error illustrated the importance to have a “solid and secure design architecture approach” towards designing software, Ince concluded.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE PHP maintainers release post-mortem report after backdoor planted in Git repo",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/critical-gravcms-vulnerability-offers-lessons-for-software-developers,"['Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Turkey', 'RCE', 'Research', 'PHP', 'Pen', 'Testing']"
no,"Facebook ‘knew about phone number data leak vulnerability two years before issue was fixed’, claims security researcher",Social media giant says ‘scraping’ was cause of issue that affected 500 million users,"As Facebook defends its actions over a massive data leak, one researcher says he notified the company of the issue a full two years before the problem was fixed.Last week, Business Insider revealed that the personal data of more than 500 million Facebook users had been posted in a low-level hacking forum where phone numbers were being offered for sale.Facebook has defended itself in a lengthy blog post, pointing out that the data was obtained by scraping, rather than hacking.Read more of the latest social media security news“We believe the data in question was scraped from people’s Facebook profiles by malicious actors using our contact importer prior to September 2019.“This feature was designed to help people easily find their friends to connect with on our services using their contact lists,” wrote product management director Mike Clark.“When we became aware of how malicious actors were using this feature in 2019, we made changes to the contact importer.“In this case, we updated it to prevent malicious actors from using software to imitate our app and upload a large set of phone numbers to see which ones matched Facebook users.”In the public eyeEthical hacker Inti De Ceukelaire says he reported the vulnerability to Facebook back in January 2017, after using the technique to discover the private phone numbers of several Belgian celebrities and politicians.Facebook had said that the issue wasn’t a breach of privacy as the users concerned had set the ‘Who can look me up’ setting to ‘Public’. This, the company said, meant that no user information was exposed that wasn’t already public.However, as De Ceukelaire points out, ‘Public’ was the default setting – and even when the phone number was set to ‘only me’, it was overridden to revert to ‘Public’.“I respectfully disagreed with the company’s response back then. It seemed like a business decision. However, I had trouble with the fact that many people were not aware that even though their phone number was set to private, they could still be looked up by their phone number by default,” De Ceukalaire told The Daily Swig.“There was not even an option to set the ‘Who can look me up’ feature to private in 2017 – they only added that later.”‘Establishing the full facts’Facebook may or may not be off the hook as far as GDPR is concerned, with the Irish Data Protection Commission, which oversees the Dublin-headquartered company, saying it is looking into the matter.“Because the scraping took place prior to GDPR, Facebook chose not to notify this as a personal data breach under GDPR,” it said in a statement.“The newly published dataset seems to comprise the original 2018 (pre GDPR) dataset and combined with additional records, which may be from a later period. The DPC attempted over the weekend to establish the full facts and is continuing to do so.”De Ceukelaire suggests that Facebook is attempting to fudge the issue.“It seems like most of their effort now goes into downplaying the breach, moving the discussion to terminology instead of the real issue and making sure they don’t issue an apology of any kind as it can be seen as an acknowledgement of responsibility for regulators,” he says.The Daily Swig has reached out to Facebook for comment and will update this story accordingly.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Enter the Matrix: Secure communications network hits 30 million user milestone",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/facebook-knew-about-phone-number-data-leak-vulnerability-two-years-before-issue-was-fixed-claims-security-researcher,"['Facebook', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Social', 'Media', 'GDPR', 'Europe', 'Mobile', 'Privacy', 'Secure', 'Development']"
no,BleedingTooth: Google drops full details of zero-click Linux Bluetooth bug chain leading to RCE,"Researcher says his findings ultimately led to a safer, more stable kernel","UPDATED A security researcher at Google has disclosed long-awaited details of zero-click vulnerabilities in the Linux Bluetooth subsystem that allow nearby, unauthenticated attackers “to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges on vulnerable devices”.Dubbed ‘BleedingTooth’, the trio of security flaws were found in BlueZ, the open source, official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack found on Linux-based laptops and IoT devices.Google security engineer Andy Nguyen dropped a technical write-up on Twitter on April 6 that exhaustively recounts how he discovered and chained the bugs to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on a Dell laptop running Ubuntu 20.04.1 without ‘victim’ interaction – as demonstrated in the video below:The achievement vindicates his decision to build on IoT security firm Armis’ uncovering of a raft of zero-day ‘BlueBorne’ vulnerabilities in 2017 that leveraged Bluetooth connections to seize control of even non-‘discoverable’ devices. (Armis later also unearthed the ‘BleedingBit’ Bluetooth chip flaws.)“Research on the Bluetooth host attack surface” otherwise seemed mostly limited to firmware or specification flaws that enabled eavesdropping or information manipulation, observed the researcher.BadKarmaThe most severe vulnerability was a high severity (CVSS score 8.3) heap-based type confusion issue dubbed ‘BadKarma’ that was, said Nguyen, “quite easy to bypass”.Providing they know the victim’s Bluetooth device address, a remote attacker positioned a “short distance” from the vulnerable device can “send a malicious l2cap packet and cause denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges”, according to a Google advisory published on October 13.The privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2020-12351), which arises due to improper input validation, was found in the Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP), one of a number of Bluetooth modules incorporated into BlueZ.Catch up on the latest IoT security newsThe medium severity flaws, both assigned a CVSS of 6.5, were also exploitable by a nearby unauthenticated attacker.The ‘BadChoice’ information disclosure bug (CVE-2020-12352) stemmed from improper access control, while the ‘BadVibes’ DoS flaw (CVE-2020-24490) arose from improper buffer restrictions.TimelineNguyen discovered the flaws and conveyed the technical details to Intel, the maintainers of the Linux Bluetooth subsystem, in July 2020. A BadVibes fix was issued on July 30, and patches for BadChoice and BadKarma arrived on September 25.However, the patches “weren’t included in any released Kernel versions” when the flaws were publicly disclosed by Google and Intel on October 13, said Nguyen. This prompted the researcher to reflect that “the Linux Kernel Security team should have been notified [at the outset] in order to facilitate coordination”.The flaws were patched in Linux 5.10 kernel, issued on October 14, the day after public disclosure.‘Safer and more stable kernel’“As I was conducting the research, I kept imagining myself as an attacker sitting at a local coffee shop or library and gaining full access to devices of the users around me, and how harmful that could be,” Andy Nguyen told The Daily Swig.“I am still surprised that the code had not been tested at all, given that simply trying to reach the A2MP would cause a crash (BadKarma). To date the impact of my research has resulted in an entire protocol (which was obsolete) being disabled.“It is my hope that in the future, distros will use these findings as a datapoint for enabling certain mitigations such as initializing the stack/heap to prevent future information leaks.”Nguyen also applied the findings to the syzkaller kernel fuzzer to enable fuzzing of the /dev/vhci device, which uncovered more than 40 additional bugs.“Although most of these bugs were unlikely to be exploitable, or even remotely triggerable, they allowed engineers to identify and fix” a raft of “other weaknesses” and “as such contributed to having a safer and more stable kernel”, said the researcher.In February, Google and the Linux Foundation announced plans to fund two full-time maintainers who will focus on strengthening kernel security and associated initiatives.Shortly after the BleedingTooth disclosure, in September, it emerged (PDF) that billions of devices supporting BlueZ, Android’s Fluoride Bluetooth stack, and the iOS BLE stack were vulnerable to Bluetooth low energy spoofing attacks.This article was updated on April 19 with additional comments from Andy Nguyen of Google.RELATED All mapped out: Researchers uncover hidden flaws in Apple’s offline ‘find my device’ feature",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/bleedingtooth-google-drops-full-details-of-zero-click-linux-bluetooth-bug-chain-leading-to-rce,"['Linux', 'IoT', 'RCE', 'Google', 'GitHub', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Mobile', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Research', 'Hardware', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'MitM', 'Intel']"

But what exactly is Matrix?The project’s website describes Matrix as the “open standard for interoperable, decentralized, real-time communication over IP” that can be used to power instant messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signaling, Internet of Things communication – “or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history”.In simpler terms, Matrix is a network that provides a common communication layer that is highly secure, end-to-end encrypted by default, and allows users to communicate with each other regardless of what app they are using.It was born out of the idea that internet services should be open and not fragmented by proprietary apps such as Skype, WhatsApp, and others that only allow users to chat within those specific platforms.READ MORE 5G network slicing flaws pose denial-of-service riskHodgson explained: “They have completely starved us of the opportunity of the web.

And before, you know, it you’re just reinventing the wheel for something like Skype or WhatsApp.“And the chances are that you might just end up keeping it proprietary and closed because you spent so much money going and building those closed silos.”The German armed forces ('Bundeswehr') created iOS and Android app BwMessenger, built on the Matrix platform, as a secure communications channelHe added: “What we’ve tried to do is to disrupt the hell out of that and go and put out the missing common communication layer for the web as a way for people to build these communication systems without having to start from scratch every time and without building additional silos and walled gardens.“It’s really a complete moonshot to go and basically replace the phone network, replace email, and have an open fabric for secure, decentralized communication that anybody can hop on top of in order to do chats, or voice, or VR, or IoT, or anything else where you might want to stream real-time data with Signal-style, end-to-end encryption and publish the history of it.”High-profile use casesIt’s this “Signal-style encryption” that attracted the likes of the French and German government to use Matrix for their official communication channels.The French government created secure communications tool Tchap by building on the Matrix network after other platforms were deemed “not suitable for government use”, project director Jérôme Ploquin was quoted as saying.The German armed forces (‘Bundeswehr’) created iOS and Android app BwMessenger, built on the Matrix platform, as a secure communications channel for some 50,000 recruits.Elsewhere in Germany, Dataport, a major IT services provider, has deployed a Matrix-based collaboration tool for 500,000 public sector workers throughout the states of Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg.INTERVIEW Offensive Security’s Ning Wang on training the next generation of infosec prosThese governments “really liked the idea of being able to run it [the channel] themselves, having each ministry controlling their own deployments, yet still being able to talk to one another”, Le Pape told The Daily Swig.Other major use cases include individual, smaller companies, and the grassroots activist community, partly due to the ease in which they can implement Matrix and transport their data securely.“Even if it’s just being able to spin up a server on our SaaS platform, [or access] Matrix services, they can extract their data… and run it on-premise,” Le Pape explained.Glitch in the MatrixWhen Matrix was first launched in 2014, it had already jumped over various security hurdles, beginning with the mammoth task of creating a decentralized network that would be impervious to nefarious actors.“First of all, decentralization where you have a big network with everybody running their own servers and critically, those servers cannot be trusted, is tough.“It’s actually a very sophisticated problem with decentralized access control, where you have a network where none of the servers can be trusted, and yet you very rapidly need to be able to make decisions about who is allowed to do what.”He added: “How do you make sure that people can’t sabotage it and screw it up for everybody? So that was a huge consideration. And frankly, we got it wrong.“First time round, there was a bug that resulted in exploits in the wild, with people of hijacking rooms and generally causing mischief.”In 2018, Hodgson said, the team performed a “tear down” of the work they had already done, found a bug, and rebuilt it again. “This time, touch wood, we got it right.”Matrix provides end-to-end encryption via the Olm and Megolm encryption protocolsSafe channelsA major consideration for the security team at Matrix was its USP: the end-to-end encryption that helps protects users’ identities and the content of the chats between them.Hodgson explained that in a decentralized network, any data in a chat, for example, is replicated in the server used by a participant.If the participants wanted to keep the conversation private, they would have to trust all of those servers “not to get owned” in order to keep the conversation safe.Multiple servers, however, only increase the attack surface, hence the need for end-to-end encryption.Hodgson said: “It’s fine, in some ways, from a data protection perspective, if the servers have been [compromised] because end-to-end encryption means that the attacker wouldn’t be able to see those conversations anyway.”The next step towards data protection, Hodgson said, is working on a means of preventing metadata from being replicating across servers, as well as employing further measures in line with GDPR to assign random IDs on a per conversation basis that do not correlate in any other conversation, thus protecting the users’ identity.Next stepsSo, what’s next for the Matrix.org Foundation? Aside from continuing to build on the Matrix network, the foundation is also a keen actor in pushing legislation that will help further protect user privacy.The EU Digital Market Act, which was proposed in December 2020, will “require gatekeepers to proactively put in place certain measures, such as targeted measures allowing the software of third parties to properly function and interoperate with their own services”.Le Pape told The Daily Swig: “It’s really interesting from our perspective to eventually get the EU to start looking at and asking everyone to be able to inter operate, or at least provide the ability for people to extract their data from one place to another and communicate between the islands and the silos.“So that’s really good for Matrix, as we’ve been trying to build this for the last seven years, so we’re glad to see that even regulators are coming our way.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Tor security: Everything you need to know about the anonymity network",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/enter-the-matrix-secure-communications-network-hits-30-million-user-milestone,"['Encryption', 'Privacy', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Interviews', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'France', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Mobile', 'Analysis', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Government', 'Organizations', 'Data', 'Leak', 'IoT', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Social', 'Media', 'Telecommunications', 'Enterprise', 'Education', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'GDPR', 'Authentication', 'Cloud', 'Security']"
no,Gigaset Android smartphones infected with malicious system update app,Vendor has confirmed the security fracas following what may have been a supply chain attack,"Gigaset smartphone users are being urged to temporarily suspend using their devices following the discovery of widespread malware deployment.Earlier this month, German tech blogger Günter Born reported that users of Gigaset Android devices were experiencing issues commonly associated with malware infections, including browser redirections to gambling websites, WhatsApp blocks due to suspicious activity, Facebook account hijacking, rapid power drains, and other erratic behavior.After reaching out to the vendor – formerly known as Siemens Home and Office Communications Devices – Gigaset confirmed that one of its update servers had been compromised at the beginning of April.In what is known as a supply chain attack, threat actors may target software distribution nodes in order to launch an assault against a wide audience, potentially either PC or mobile users.INSIGHT Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowGigaset device owners impacted by the incident who attempted to remove the malware reported that reinfection occurred a matter of hours later.This appears to be due to the malware being loaded as the system’s ‘Update’ component – a pre-installed package that continuously updates the handset’s software.‘Malware issues’In a statement to Born (translated), the vendor confirmed that “older smartphones had malware issues” and the company was “working intensively on a short-term solution for the affected users”.Gigaset added that, from now, malware should not be delivered to handsets.An analysis conducted by security firm Malwarebytes lists the Gigaset GS270, Gigaset GS160, Siemens GS270, and Siemens GS160 (Android OS 8.1.0), alongside the Alps P40pro (Android OS 9.0) and Alps S20pro+ (Android OS 10.0) as ladened with the malware.Read more of the latest smartphone security newsAccording to Gigaset, it is “assumed” that the GS110, GS185, GS190, GS195, GS195LS, GS280, GS290, GX290, GX290 plus, GX290 PRO, GS3 and GS4 – are not impacted.Malwarebytes says the culprit system app, com.redstone.ota.ui, is loading three variants of Trojan.Downloader.Agent.WAGD.The Android-specific trojan is not only capable of disrupting daily user activities but also of downloading and executing additional payloads and sending malicious SMS/WhatsApp messages, a vector for distributing the malware.Paranoid AndroidAs the app is considered part of the Android system and cannot be removed without extreme difficulty, Born has recommend that you “lay the device dead” until Gigaset fully resolves the issue.If this is not possible, Malwarebytes has offered a workaround to uninstall ‘Update’ and keep using an impacted device, albeit with an element of risk attached.There is another catch: this workaround will stop the handset from being legitimately updated in the future, and so users will need to monitor Gigaset’s progress in restoring the server and cleaning up the update function before re-enabling the update technolgy.The Daily Swig has reached out to Gigaset with additional queries and we will update when we hear back.RECOMMENDED PHP maintainers release post-mortem report after backdoor planted in Git repo",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/gigaset-android-smartphones-infected-with-malicious-system-update-app,"['Mobile', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'PHP', 'Zero-day', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Malware', 'Android', 'Google', 'Organizations', 'Spyware', 'Privacy']"
no,European privacy regulators lay down rules for Covid-status passports,"Coronavirus travel pass plans must prioritize data privacy, says European Data Protection Board","European privacy regulators have accepted the need for the EU’s proposed ‘digital green certificate’ while warning that plans need to be compliant with data protection legislation.The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) gave a cautious thumbs-up to the European Commission’s plan through a joint statement released on Tuesday (April 6).The digital green certificate is designed to facilitate free movement within the EU during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic by “establishing a common framework for the issuance, verification, and acceptance of interoperable Covid-19 vaccination, testing, and recovery certificates”.Legal warningIn a joint statement, the EDPB and EDPS argue that any rollout should be based on the foundation of a solid legal framework before directly warning of the discriminatory potential of the proposed technology.“The EDPB and the EDPS underline that the use of the Digital Green Certificate may not, in any way, result in direct or indirect discrimination of individuals, and must be fully in line with the fundamental principles of necessity, proportionality, and effectiveness,” they contend.There are concerns both in Europe and the UK that the proposals could discriminate against those who are unable to get vaccinated, a population including pregnant women and those whose medical condition renders the vaccine a health risk.Privacy advocates and others also worry about mission creep – the possibility that health data collected for the so-called Covid-19 passport could be used for other purposes.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Coronavirus and supply chain attacks highlight ‘lack of coordination’ across EUAny measures introduced ought to be temporary and limited to the duration of the pandemic, according to the regulators.Wojciech Wiewiórowski of the EDPS, said: “It must be made clear that the proposal does not allow for – and must not lead to – the creation of any sort of central database of personal data at EU level.“In addition, it must be ensured that personal data is not processed any longer than what is strictly necessary and that access to and use of this data is not permitted once the pandemic has ended.”Security experts reserved judgment on the EU's proposals and similar plans to introduce a ‘Covid status passport’ in the UK.“Much depends on how it is implemented, where data is held, how identifiable it is and who can access the data,” Professor Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, told The Daily Swig. “Personally would prefer a privacy preserving technique such as used for” the government's Covid-19 contact tracing app.READ MORE Fake Covid-19 vaccines pose ‘serious health hazard’, warns Interpol",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/european-privacy-regulators-lay-down-rules-for-covid-status-passports,"['Privacy', 'Coronavirus', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Europe', 'GDPR', 'Industry', 'News', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Legal', 'UK', 'Healthcare']"
no,NSA workflow application Emissary vulnerable to malicious takeover,Users urged to update their systems after disclosure of serious vulnerabilities,"Emissary, an open source, peer-to-peer (P2P) workflow engine developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA), contains vulnerabilities that attackers could chain to take over Emissary instances.Users have been urged to update their systems after the discovery of five security flaws in the Java web application, which runs in a multi-tiered P2P network of computer resources.In a blog post published on Monday (April 5), security researchers from Swiss infosec outfit SonarSource demonstrated how an attacker could mount a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against a logged-in user to exploit a code injection vulnerability and achieve remote code execution (RCE).Read more of the latest open source security newsThey also combined arbitrary file disclosure and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws to read arbitrary files from the Emissary server.Once the XSS payload is executed in the victim’s browser, the file disclosure vulnerability could be exploited to read administrator credentials and relay them to an attacker-controlled server – resulting in a “quick and easy” server compromise demonstrated in the video below:XSS and arbitrary file disclosureThe Emissary XSS flaw was found in a DocumentAction error response message generated when a requested document was not found, resulting in user input being reflected without output encoding.An attacker could therefore craft a malicious link that, if clicked by an authenticated victim, passes a payload that executes JavaScript in the browser, explained SonarSource researcher Dennis Brinkrolf.RELATED NSA advises US security supply chain on replacing deprecated encryption protocolsThe file disclosure flaw was found in a feature showing configuration files. The user-controlled HTTP GET variable CONFIG_PARAM was received from the query string, and the configName variable was not sanitized and could contain any file path.A path traversal attack that injects character sequences such as ../ would therefore enable a malicious user to access authentication files on Emissary’s HTTP Digest Authentication function, which by default has administrator credentials for only a single user.Remote takeoverFound in a console feature used to evaluate Ruby code, the code injection bug arises from the absence of CSRF tokens.Brinkrolf demonstrated how if the user-controlled post parameter CONSOLE_COMMAND mirrors the string eval then an attacker-controlled post variable, CONSOLE_COMMAND_STRING, is received and passed to the function evalAndWait() from the RubyConsole class.The vulnerable eval() function then receives a Ruby expression as the first parameter controllable by an attacker, who can therefore execute arbitrary Ruby code through the browser of a logged-in administrator.SonarSource researchers also discovered authenticated file delete and file upload vulnerabilities.Disclosure timelineThe vulnerabilities were found in Emissary version 5.9.0.The researchers initiated contact with Emissary’s maintainers on September 24, 2020, and sent them an advisory on October 16. Version 5.11.0, which addressed the RCE issue, was then issued on December 15.After being notified of the remaining vulnerabilities on January 7, Emissary maintainers then released version 6.1 on March 2.However, on March 5 SonarSource informed maintainers that the CSRF and path traversal problems remained unpatched.The Daily Swig has asked the maintainers about a timeline for final patches – we will update this article if and when we hear back.RELATED LocalStack zero-day vulnerabilities chained to achieve remote takeover of local instances",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nsa-workflow-application-emissary-vulnerable-to-malicious-takeover,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'CSRF', 'Path', 'Traversal', 'RCE', 'XSS', 'java', 'Authentication', 'Privacy', 'Organizations', 'Network', 'Security', 'US', 'Switzerland', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Browsers']"
no,PHP maintainers release post-mortem report after backdoor planted in Git repo,"More details released about the incident, though the attacker remains unidentified","The maintainers of PHP have released a post-mortem report after an unknown actor pushed backdoored code onto the scripting language’s official PHP Git repository.As previously reported by The Daily Swig, an attacker pushed two commits to the php-src repo that contained a backdoor allowing for remote code execution (RCE).They are thought to have gained access to the main server, which allowed them to plant the backdoor under the guise of a minor edit made in a maintainer’s name.Last night (April 6), maintainer Nikita Popov released more details related to the attack and said the team no longer believes the git.php.net server was compromised, but that the master.php.net user database was leaked.BACKGROUND Backdoor planted in PHP Git repository after server hackThe update includes information on a series of changes made to improve security, including that the master.php.net has been migrated to a new system, main.php.net.All php.net passwords have been reset and users need to request a new one via the ‘forgot password’ function.Popov also revealed that both git.php.net and svn.php.net are now read-only “but will remain available for the time being”.Deep diveAfter first suspecting that PHP co-creator Rasmus Lerdorf’s account had been compromised, Popov said she investigated the PHP giolite installation to determine which account pushed the malicious code.It was then that she realized that there were no git-receive-pack entries for the two malicious commits, meaning that they bypassed the gitolite infrastructure entirely.“This was interpreted as likely evidence of a server compromise,” wrote Popov.The team then discontinued the git.php.net server and migrated to GitHub as the repository host.Read more of the latest database security newsPopov also found that git.php.net intentionally supported pushing changes not only via SSHbut also via HTTPS.“The latter did not use gitolite, and instead used git-http-backend behind Apache2 Digest authentication against the master.php.net user database.”Popov added: “Based on access logs, we can determine that the commits were indeed pushed using HTTPS and password-based authentication.”Unclear entry pointThe team suspects that a database leak gave the malicious attacker access to the passwords, though they also made several attempts to guess usernames, with Popov writing that “it is unclear why the attacker would need to guess usernames in that case”.In light of a possible leak, changes have been made including migrating to master.php.net, which is running PHP 8, and introducing support for TLS1.2.Popov also noted that the implementation has been moved towards using parameterized queries, “to be more confident that SQL injections cannot occur”.Passwords are now stored using bcrypt after previously being stored in a format compatible with HTTP Digest authentication – “essentially a plain md5 hash” – which was required for HTTP authentication on git.php.net and svn.php.net.More details on the changes can be found in Popov’s advisory.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE UC Berkeley confirms data breach, becomes latest victim of Accellion cyber-attack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/php-maintainers-release-post-mortem-report-after-backdoor-planted-in-git-repo,"['Database', 'Security', 'PHP', 'RCE', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'GitHub', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Analysis', 'Secure', 'Development', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Industry', 'News', 'DevSecOps', 'TLS', 'DevOps', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Encryption']"

no,Smart TV tech loophole allowed miscreants to view private YouTube videos,"Security researcher earns $6,000 bug bounty for thinking outside of the box","A security researcher earned a $6,000 bug bounty after uncovering a set of web security flaws that allowed attackers to play supposedly private YouTube videos.David Schütz (@xdavidhu) reported the privacy weaknesses to YouTube’s parent company Google, which acted promptly to shore up security controls after verifying the problem last July.This cleared the way for Schütz to offer a detailed technical write-up on the privacy-related issue, which he published on Monday (April 5).Remote controlSchütz first began exploring the issue some years ago after noticing the YouTube app on his Android phone gave him the option of playing private videos on a friend’s internet-connected smart television.The researcher wasn’t signed into the TV at the time – a factor that later encouraged Schütz to explore how the technology worked after he had joined Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program.The YouTube for Android TV App is, as it transpired, is essentially a website rather than a complex Android application. Schütz discovered that the technology loads content in a WebView-like browser, called Cobalt.RELATED Details of YouTube viewing history exposure bug made publicAfter changing the User-Agent header on his PC-based browser to Cobalt, Schütz was able to get at the YouTube TV app and begin testing.At the time, users were able to control a TV via the desktop YouTube site, even if they were on a different network. This feature has subsequently been removed from the user interface, according to Schütz.After pairing an emulated smart TV with another browser running on a PC, Schütz discovered that he had the option of playing private YouTube videos on the television.This setup allowed Schütz to examine the pairing process between a mobile device and a smart TV, allowing the researcher to uncover some interesting behavior in the process.Going to the pollsAfter starting the pairing process, the TV switches into a ‘polling’ mode, which is quite a common thing at Google.Instead of WebSockets, Google usually uses these bind requests, which are basically HTTP requests that take very long if there are no new events but return immediately if there are some. And the TV calls this /bind endpoint over and over.Read more of the latest security research from around the worldExamining how this process worked allowed the researcher to figure out that Google was using an extra video-specific token, called ‘ctt’, in order to permit a user to play private YouTube videos:When the user requests to play a private video, the event the TV receives from the /bind endpoint includes an extra ctt parameter next to the videoId.When playing the video, the TV then requests the raw video URL from the /get_video_info endpoint and includes the ctt token as a GET parameter named vtt (for some reason). Without the ctt token, the TV can’t watch the private video.This ctt token supposedly only gives permission to watch that specific video rather than any other private video.After examining the process using Burp Suite, Schütz uncovered a web security flaw in this “remote control” technology involving a POST request to a /bind endpoint.“Due to a missing CSRF [cross-sire request forgery] protection in the YouTube Lounge API (an API for remote controlling YouTube TVs), a malicious website could control/send commands to YouTube TVs, in the name of the victim who visited the website,” Schütz told The Daily Swig.Outside the boxLeft unaddressed, the flaw a means for an attacker to view and/or videos marked as private on YouTube after only a minimal amount of social engineering trickery.Schütz explained: “An attacker could have set up an evil TV, and using a malicious website, instruct the victim's browser to play all of the victim’s YouTube videos on the attacker's evil TV, thereby stealing all of the victim’s private and unlisted videos.”In order to fix the flaw, Google made changes so that the /bind endpoint now requires an Authorization header with an OAuth Bearer token to be authenticated, according to Schütz.DON’T FORGET TO READ Google awards researcher $133,337 top prize in cloud security competitionBefore the flaw was resolved, an attacker could have stolen all private and unlisted videos from a victim (and even the contents of private playlists such as the ‘Watch Later’ list), simply by enticing them to open a malicious website.All an attacker would need to do would have been to trick a victim into clicking a link while signed into YouTube, according to Schütz.The Daily Swig invited Google to comment on Schütz’s research.

no,Apple macOS TextEdit parsing flaw leaked local files via dangling markup injection,Flaw allowed attacker to leak victim’s IP address and gain access to local files,"UPDATED A macOS vulnerability enabled attackers to execute malicious HTML within TXT files that, if opened by victims, could leak their IP address and, worse still, give access to local files.Now patched, the security flaw stemmed from how TXT files were parsed by TextEdit, the open source Apple application that opens TXT files by default.Despite this development – and the 2019 discovery of memory corruption bugs leading to RCE in Microsoft’s equivalent text editor, Notepad – antivirus software, firewalls, and MacOS Gatekeeper treat TXT files “as safe downloads that can't possibly be malicious” because they supposedly contain only text, said security researcher Paulos Yibelo in a blog post.“They shouldn't blindly trust TXT files,” the researcher tells The Daily Swig. Regardless of a file’s extension, “what interprets the file and how it is interpreted matters more than anything” .TXT or any other extension “can be malicious if PHP includes it as code,” he adds.‘Lots of potential attack vectors’Resolving to explore this underestimated attack vector, Yibelo found that basic customizations made on TextEdit, such as making text bold or italicized, are parsed using the RTF format.Testing then revealed that TextEdit could be tricked into thinking an opened .TXT file was in fact an RTF-HTML file. If a TXT file began with <!DOCTYPE HTML><html><head></head><body>, TextEdit parsed the HTML, thus permitting the injection of limited HTML and opening up “lots of potential attack vectors”.Leaking the IP addressActing on this discovery, the researcher then found that macOS Gatekeeper, which is designed to only allow trusted software to run, failed to quarantine a TXT file force-downloaded from the Tor browser that, once opened, leaked the victim’s IP address without their knowledge.“This is why I use my fully Tor-ified network rather than just Tor Browser,” tweeted HardenedBSD co-founder Shawn Webb in response to the research. “There's absolutely zero chance for info leakage.”TextEdit apparently conducted “very limited parsing” on the HTML and many “interesting” HTML attributes were unavailable, said Yibelo.Read more of the latest Apple security newsFuzzing revealed that CSS property <style> @import { ""url ""} </style> was allowed to load local CSS files, and the only scheme that worked – file:/// – blocked external requests, but not the opening of other locally stored files.Yibelo noted that macOS automount, which is used to manage mount points for directory mounting application autofs, permitted file:/// URLs to issue remote requests.He added that automount can also make remote requests to an external drive, so that ‘ls/net/EXAMPLE.com’ forces [macOS to] send a remote request to EXAMPLE.com.“While they did a good job blocking TextEdit from making external requests, this was the one thing [Apple] forgot when they allowed file:/// scheme, on OSX file:///net/11.22.33.44/a.css [which] connects to 11.22.33.44.”Since automount uses the kernel to make TCP connections, even if the victim used a proxy their real IP address would still be leaked.“Allowing unprivileged users [to] automatically mount network resources unchecked is a rather huge security vulnerability,” Shawn Webb also said in his Twitter thread on the research. “None of my systems have autofs/automount enabled for this reason.”Yibelo also previewed an upcoming browser exploit that means force-downloaded TXT files can “be opened without user interaction or warning” and leak the “IP straight out of Tor browser.”Low-dangling fruitAnother HTML attribute that loaded local files – <iframedoc> – meant an attacker could embed local files using <iframedoc src=""file:///etc/passwd""> and view the TXT file’s contents.Yibelo then mounted a dangling markup attack, a scriptless data leaking technique used when dynamic scripting is disabled.“By combining the <style> CSS attribute with the <iframedoc> attribute, an attacker can first include an unclosed style tag, embed the contents of the file they want to steal, and then leak the content as dangling parameters to their evil site as soon as the file is open,” he explained.“Given how simple it is to exploit, I’d give it a high CVSS,” said the researcher.Shawn Webb also said: “These days, there aren’t many text editors that will just edit text and do nothing more,” before adding: “As security researchers, we're left with dumping the contents of the file with a simple hex editor and parsing each hex character ourselves. That is, at least, if you need to be incredibly careful.

no,President Biden’s new executive order could oblige software vendors to tell Uncle Sam about security breaches,Prompt disclosure shake-up follows SolarWinds calamity,"Software vendors will be obliged to promptly notify their US federal government customers in the event of any security breach, a draft executive order from President Joe Biden’s administration proposes.The order – which follows the high impact SolarWinds breach late last year – would also mandate the use of multi-factor authentication and data encryption within US federal agencies, Reuters reports.In addition, the order would compel vendors to retain more records and work with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in responding to incidents.In essence, the Biden administration is seeking to leverage the enormous buying power of the US federal government in order to produce changes in software vulnerability disclosure practices that will affect the whole industry.Industry experts canvassed by The Daily Swig broadly supported the proposals, which remain in draft but could be introduced as early as this week.SolarWinds blowMorgan Wright, chief security advisor at SentinelOne, and a former US State Department special advisor, said the issue of mandatory breach reporting surfaced during recent Senate hearings on SolarWinds.The concept of notifying the government when a breach occurs was generally supported by companies (including SolarWinds, Microsoft, and FireEye) testifying a recent US Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing, but not without concerns about whether this might create a difficult-to-manage administrative tangle, according to Wright.Wright explained: “The key issue was liability. Government contracts go into excruciating detail about liability, and to impose an executive order without clearly spelling out how every contract will be modified to limit or prevent liability will be an acquisition and procurement nightmare.”“In theory, more transparency and disclosure [are both] needed to improve the cybersecurity posture of the federal government. In reality, this will become a bureaucratic nightmare,” Wright concluded.RELATED Incoming Biden administration looks to shake up US cybersecurity policyImmature securityAustin Berglas, global head of professional services at cybersecurity services company BlueVoyant, said organizations need to get better at detecting breaches for any stricter disclosure regime to work.“Requiring organizations to report breaches to federal government customers will rely heavily on the maturity of the vendor’s security,” Berglas, a former assistant special agent in charge of cyber investigations at the FBI’s New York office, told The Daily Swig.“In order for an organization to report a breach in a timely matter, that organization needs to have the appropriate visibility to detect an intrusion.”Preservation of digital records, implementing multi-factor authentication, and proper utilization of encryption are all standard cybersecurity hygiene recommendations seen in numerous frameworks and guidance.The Biden administration is taking steps to secure supply chains after the SolarWinds breachIt is commonplace to find organizations with hundreds of vendors in their supply chain, and the biggest challenge will come from “identifying ways that the government can help immature vendors attain and maintain the basic cybersecurity standards”, according to Berglas.“Not only do companies have limited resources to assess the security of all the vendors in their supply chain, worse, they are still using questionnaires to assess security posture instead of using technology to identify external risks to the chain,” Berglas argued.“The proposed standards are all solid improvements which would enhance the overall security of the supply chain, but the true task [is] in finding ways to enable and empower the most immature organizations with the ability and resources to meet those requirements.”Legacy risksIn cases where vendors are asked to support (outdated) legacy systems, vulnerable IT infrastructures are hardly the fault of the services and software providers.“Many systems inside government are so antiquated that contracts are let on a regular basis looking for support of software that has not been officially supported for years,” according to SentinelOne’s Wright.Modern software is a combination of proprietary code and open source components. This means software security and guarding against supply chain attacks becomes an issue of safeguarding an entire ecosystem.“The days of software being created exclusively within the proverbial four walls of a commercial software vendor are long gone,” said Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at the Synopsys CyRC (Cybersecurity Research Center).Technical debtJames Christiansen, vice president of security transformation at Netskope, said that better communication around software vulnerabilities is “warranted and essential”, while noting that the government regulations can only go so far in addressing an endemic problem.“While this action is a step in the right direction for the government sector, we also need to think about what happens in the private sector,” according to Christiansen.“It’s not surprising to see this executive order formalise the requirements for information sharing by software vendors while also including authentication and encryption measures, but for data protection to be effective, it needs to encompass multiple environments reaching far beyond encryption.""When quizzed by The Daily Swig the proposed regulations were generally seen by those in the industry as solid improvements which would enhance the overall security of supply chains – though several cautioned not to expect miracles.SentinelOne’s Wright warned: ”None of these proposed remedies will stop every software supply chain attack. By the time software arrives at the government, as in SolarWinds, the attack had already occurred against the supplier.”BACKGROUND Multiple new flaws uncovered in SolarWinds software just weeks after high-profile supply chain attack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/president-bidens-new-executive-order-could-oblige-software-vendors-to-tell-uncle-sam-about-security-breaches,"['Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Data', 'Breach', 'US', 'Government', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Analysis', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'North', 'America', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Telecommunications', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Privacy', 'Hardware', 'Encryption', 'Legal', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software']"

no,DeepDotWeb operator pleads guilty for role in $8.4m darknet marketplace kickback scheme,"Internet portal directed users to dark web sites selling malware, hacking tools, firearms, and drugs","An Israeli citizen has pleaded guilty before a US court over his role in operating DeepDotWeb, which served as an internet gateway to illicit dark web marketplaces before its 2019 seizure.Tal Prihar, 37, submitted the plea yesterday (March 31) in relation to a money laundering charge centered on the generation of 8,155 bitcoins in kickback payments from darknet affiliates, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release.The affiliate-style cryptocurrency fees were worth around $8.4 million at the time of payment, the DoJ said.Along with co-defendant and fellow Israeli Michael Phan, 34, Prihar stands accused of owning and operating DeepDotWeb between October 2013 and May 2019, when the pair were arrested following an international law enforcement investigation.The investigation involved Europol and law enforcement agencies in the US, UK, Brazil, Israel, Netherlands, and Germany.Darknet doorwayDeepDotWeb generated revenues by advertising links that directed users to illegal darknet marketplaces selling malware, hacking tools, stolen data, illegal firearms, heroin and fentanyl, among other illicit goods. Darknet sites do not appear in mainstream internet search engine results.DeepDotWeb also featured darknet-related news, reviews of darknet markets, and interviews with cybercriminals.Catch up on the latest dark web security newsPrihar and Phan received payments in cryptocurrency from their darknet affiliates.In an attempt to break the link between the payments and their source, Prihar transferred the funds from his DeepDotWeb bitcoin wallet to bitcoin accounts and bank accounts under his control but in the names of shell companies.“For six years, DeepDotWeb was a gateway to facilitate the illegal purchase of items to include dangerous drugs, weapons, and malicious software,” said acting special agent in charge Carlton Peeples of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office.“Prihar profited as a byproduct from other people’s dangerous transactions and today’s guilty plea sends a message to other cyber actors across the globe who think the dark web is a safe haven.”Prihar, who currently resides in Brazil, has agreed to forfeit $8,414,173.Sentencing is scheduled for August 2 and the defendant faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.Co-conspirator Michael Phan is still awaiting trial while being held in US custody.MDMA darknet arrestIn another, related DoJ announcement yesterday, an operator of ‘The Collective’, a darknet vendor specializing in the distribution of the illegal psychoactive drug MDMA, was sentenced to 46 months in federal prison and three years’ supervised release.Records seized from US citizen James Campbell Cardwell, 28, suggested that the defendant was involved in more than 3,000 transactions generating sales exceeding $197,000.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/deepdotweb-operator-pleads-guilty-for-role-in-8-4m-darknet-marketplace-kickback-scheme,"['Dark', 'Web', 'Legal', 'US', 'Europe', 'Latin', 'America', 'North', 'America', 'Middle', 'East', 'Germany', 'Netherlands', 'UK', 'Israel', 'Cybercrime', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Europol', 'E-Commerce', 'Malware', 'Tor']"
yes,Vulnerabilities in Single Sign-On services could be abused to bypass authentication controls,"SAML XML injection gives attackers free rein over user accounts, although hard-to-execute bug proves real-world threat is minimal","UPDATED A class of vulnerability detected in several Single Sign-On (SSO) services might allow attackers to hack into corporate systems, security researchers at NCC Group warn.SSO technology is an approach to authentication and identity management that allows enterprise users to access to array of corporate applications through a single (often third-party) service.The technology, which has been widely adopted among enterprises, offers convenience to users because it gets around the need to manage multiple workplace passwords.As well as cutting down on helpdesk calls, the technology offers a way to manage credentials and privileges from a single location and increases security – at least in theory.Security researcher Adam Roberts of NCC Group has discovered similar vulnerabilities in several SSO services that rely on Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to authenticate users.These implementation flaws create a potential means to break into systems and cause all manner of mischief, Roberts warns in a technical blog post.“The flaw could allow an attacker to modify SAML responses generated by an identity provider, and thereby gain unauthorized access to arbitrary user accounts, or to escalate privileges within an application,” according to Roberts.Play it again, SAMLSAML is a standard that allows authentication and authorization data to be securely exchanged between different contexts.The technology integrates with Active Directory, Microsoft’s proprietary directory service, which makes it easy to roll out and hence a popular option for enterprise-grade SSO deployments.Authentication requests in this scenario are directed through identity providers through SAML request message. This generates a response that typically authorizes an enterprise user to make use of a specified application.RECOMMENDED Ransomware: Nearly a fifth of victims who pay off extortionists fail to get their data backRoberts discovered that these SAML authentication responses might be modified through a technique known as “SAML XML injection”.More specifically it “may be possible for an attacker to inject additional XML and change the structure of the SAML message”, as Roberts explains:Depending on the location of the injection and the configuration of the service provider, it may be possible to inject additional roles, modify the receiver of the assertion, or to inject an entirely new username in an attempt to compromise another user’s account.Crucially, it should be noted that the XML for SAML assertions and responses is always built before a cryptographic signature is applied. Therefore, the use of response signatures does not protect against this vulnerability.According to Roberts, the security weakness most commonly shows up where SAML identity providers have “naively” used string templates to build the SAML XML messages. “User-controlled data may be inserted into the template string using a templating language, regex match/replace, or simple concatenation,” Roberts warns.Is your organization vulnerable?This potentially damaging authentication vulnerability can be identified in testing using common XML injection probing payloads.The NCC blog post goes on to note that exploiting SAML XML injection vulnerabilities is something of an art, and much more difficult than simply identifying flawed implementations, a comparatively straightforward exercise.Catch up on the latest authentication-related security newsRoberts told The Daily Swig that the issue arose from an ""implementation bug rather than an inherent flaw in the SAML specification"".""The issue seems to arise when developers build XML documents insecurely, including the use of string-based templates to create the SAML response XML or incorrect use of an XML library,"" he explained.Roberts used this technique in a number of engagements, and the research is a ""lab distillation of the experiences gained from that work combined with supplemental research"", NCC Group explained.It’s unclear to what extent, if at all, real-world attackers are relying on the approach.Roberts concluded: “To address the issue, developers of identity providers should check their codebase and ensure that user-controlled data is not being included within a SAML response insecurely.""We’d recommend that security researchers and enterprise penetration testers add this technique to their methodologies when testing a SAML identity provider to help them ensure they are also protected against this recently uncovered bug type.”This story has been updated to include comment from Adam Roberts, senior security consultant at NCC Group",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerabilities-in-single-sign-on-services-could-be-abused-to-bypass-authentication-controls,"['Authentication', 'Research', 'Passwords', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Pen', 'Testing', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Privacy', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Email', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Microsoft', 'Windows']"
no,French certification scheme for infosec service providers off to promising start,"Dozens of companies already ExpertCyber-certified, just six weeks after initiative’s launch","A new French government certification scheme for providers of cybersecurity services has made an auspicious start, according to the project’s manager.Designed to help organizations find competent, reliable service providers, the ExpertCyber initiative certifies French companies that both install and maintain security products, as well as provide incident response services.Organizations in any sector can use the ExpertCyber directory to check whether a particular company is certified, or to search for providers that meet their specific requirements.DON’T FORGET TO READ France tops blue-chip cybersecurity maturity indexThe scheme was unveiled last month by Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, a government resource dedicated to supporting cyber-attack victims.The project’s partners include digital trade bodies Federation EBEN, Cinov Numérique, and Syntec Numérique, the French Insurance Federation (FFA), and AFNOR (Association Française de Normalisation), the French standardization and ISO member body.‘Early feedback’Dozens of service providers have apparently been convinced that the ExpertCyber label might give them an edge when pitching for business from organizations contending with surging ransomware attacks and an attack surface enlarged for Covid-19-related reasons.Six weeks on from the scheme’s February 17 launch “there are 55 labeled companies and many more candidates”, ExpertCyber project manager Franck Gicquel told The Daily Swig.“It’s just the beginning” but early feedback is “good”, he added.Gicquel also said the project wasn’t modelled on similar schemes in place elsewhere.“We don't know any similar approach in other countries,” he said. “We just wanted to fill a true need for small and medium companies to easily find trustworthy IT security service providers.”Audit processExpertCyber applicants must pay an €800 fee, complete a technical questionnaire, and furnish documentary evidence that they meet various criteria. A certification decision is then made following an audit conducted by AFNOR.Auditors assess competence in everything from technical proficiency to GDPR compliance and customer support standards.Certified companies win the right to use the ExpertCyber logo on their website and marketing communications, and are given guidance on how to convey the assurances the label offers to prospective customers.Catch up on the latest France security newsThe label expires after two years unless renewed. Providers can re-apply in the event of a failed audit.Information security firms with a valid ‘security visa’ under a similar certification scheme operated by the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) are entitled to automatic ExpertCyber certification.Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, which runs a public bug bounty program, is operated by GIP ACYMA (Le Groupement d’Intérêt Public Action contre la Cybermalveillance), a public-private partnership set up in 2017 to help citizens, businesses, and local authorities strengthen their security posture.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/french-certification-scheme-for-infosec-service-providers-off-to-promising-start,"['France', 'Government', 'Certification', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'GDPR', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Europe', 'Enterprise', 'VDP', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Cybercrime', 'Compliance', 'Coronavirus', 'Ransomware', 'Malware', 'Education']"

no,Indian payment provider MobiKwik denies 8.2 TB data breach,"Fintech firm refutes breach reports, claims customer information is safe","Indian payment services provider MobiKwik continues to deny reports of a huge data breach affecting millions of customers, despite multiple sources claiming otherwise.Earlier this month (March 4), the company took to Twitter to accuse “a media-crazed so-called security researcher” of falsely reporting it had been subject to a leak.MobiKwik claimed that its user and company data was “completely safe and secure” in a Twitter thread.Commenting on the report, the company said: “The various sample text files that he has been showcasing prove nothing. Anyone can create such text files to falsely harass any company.”Fast forward to last night (March 29), when reports claimed that the details of 3.5 million MobiKwik users – equaling around 8.2 TB of data records – were discovered on the dark web.‘Huge breach’Posting on RaidForums, an underground marketplace, a user by the name of ‘ninja_storm’ claimed to have 8.2 TB of data that had been taken from MobileWiki.The sensitive personal information of millions of customers, including their payment card details, names, and addresses, as well as user email addresses, phone numbers, passwords to installed mobile apps, IP addresses, and GPS locations.According to ninja_storm, there are potentially 10 million KYC records included in the breached database. KYC – or ‘Know Your Customer’ – is a verification process Indian banks use to ensure services are not misused.A screenshot of a post claiming to have access to user data from MobiKwikThe purported data breach was first disclosed by security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia on March 1, when he contacted MobiKwik to inform them of the leak.However, as seen in screenshots posted to Twitter, MobiKwik denied that there was an issue.Rajaharia also alleged that MobiKwik failed to honor a bug bounty payout after he reported a security vulnerability that was fixed but not acknowledged.Rajaharia posted about the incident on Twitter and found his account was subsequently locked due to “posting personal information”, after an apparent request by MobiKwik to have his tweets taken down.A few days later, MobiKwik tweeted the claims that their data was “safe and secure”.‘Biggest leak in history’Security researcher Baptiste Robert, known online as ‘Eliot Alderson’, also found his Twitter account locked after claiming that the incident is “the biggest KYC leak in history”.Twitter user Kiran Jonnalagadda shared a screenshot of what he says is his own payment data from the leak.And Troy Hunt, founder of breach detection website Have I Been Pwned?, wrote: “Never *ever* behave like @MobiKwik has in this thread from 25 days ago.

no,Ransomware: Nearly a fifth of victims who pay off extortionists fail to get their data back,Double jeopardy,"UPDATED Many consumer victims of ransomware scams fail to get access to their data even after they pay off extortionists, according to a survey by Kaspersky.The poll found that close to half (46%) of UK ransomware victims paid the ransom to restore access to their data last year, yet an unfortunate 11% of victims who shelled out did not have their stolen data returned.Whether they paid or not, only 18% of 1,006 UK victims surveyed were able to restore all their encrypted or blocked files following an attack.Internationally the picture is still worse with more than half (56%) paying off extortionists and nearly one in five of whom (17%) failing to get their data back even after paying out.In a multi-national poll (PDF) of 15,000 consumers commissioned by Kaspersky, only 29% of users who experienced ransomware attacks were able to restore all their encrypted or blocked files after an attack.Half lost at least some files, 32% lost a significant amount, and 18% lost a small number of files. Meanwhile, 13% who did experience such an incident lost almost all their data.Get the latest ransomware news and analysisMarina Titova, head of consumer product marketing at Kaspersky, commented that “handing over money doesn’t guarantee the return of data, and only encourages cybercriminals to continue the practice”.Kaspersky advises users to regularly back up their data and use security software in order to safeguard against potential ransomware infestation.Consumers are advised to avoid clicking links in spam emails or visiting unfamiliar websites. Caution in opening email attachments from senders you do not trust, or in using USB discs of uncertain origin, is also advised.ShakedownRansomware is a form of malware that either encrypts data or (less commonly) locks users out of their devices. Victims are told they need to pay in order to get access to encryption keys that will supposedly unlock their compromised data.Payments are typically made in digital currency – most commonly bitcoin – with prices that escalate in time in order to further coerce unfortunate marks into paying up.READ MORE SSRF vulnerability in NPM package Netmask impacts up to 279k projectsA recent study by cyber intelligence firm Group-IB separately estimated that the number of ransomware attacks grew by more than 150% in 2020.Ransomware attacks not only grew in number, but also in scale and sophistication – the average ransom demand increased by more than twofold and amounted to $170,000 in 2020.Kaspersky’s survey was released on the eve of World Backup Day (March 31).The cybersecurity firm was unable to say whether or not the experience of consumers is mirrored by that of business ransomware victims, since the survey focused specifically on consumers.But it added that it's clear that a significant number of businesses that fall victim to ransomware attacks do also pay the ransom.“Ransom payments fuel the further development of ransomware attacks,” a representative of Kaspersky told The Daily Swig. “This why some (including former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin) have publicly called for ransom payments to be made illegal – to deprive ransomware gangs of the funding they use to develop their business further.“Moreover, there have certainly been cases reported where criminals have failed to restore the data of businesses that have paid a ransom,” the representative added.This story has been updated to add comment from Kaspersky and figures from the international portion of its surveyRELATED Ransomware attacks more than doubled last year as cybercrime operations scale up during coronavirus pandemic",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ransomware-nearly-a-fifth-of-victims-who-pay-off-extortionists-fail-to-get-their-data-back,"['Ransomware', 'Cybercrime', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Database', 'Security', 'Malware', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Oceania', 'Latin', 'America', 'North', 'America', 'Africa', 'Privacy', 'Data', 'Breach', 'UK', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Dark', 'Web']"
no,Serious Netmask vulnerability found to affect three Perl IP modules,"The flaw, which could lead to SSRF, has now been patched","UPDATED A trio of Perl modules are potentially vulnerable to a serious upstream security flaw in Net::Netmask, a Perl distribution used to parse, manipulate, and lookup IP network blocks.The affected CPAN modules include Net-CIDR-Lite, used to merge IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR addresses; Net-IPAddress-Util, a version-agnostic IP address representation; and Data-Validate-IP, an IPv4 and IPv6 validator, said Perl developer Dave Rolsky in a blog post published yesterday (March 29).Security implicationsAs reported by The Daily Swig, the potentially “catastrophic” security vulnerability in Netmask, an NPM package, could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF) in downstream applications.The nine-year old, unauthenticated flaw was remediated in Netmask v2.0, issued on March 20, although the subsequent discovery of a further flaw prompted the project maintainer to release v2.1 yesterday.BACKGROUND SSRF vulnerability in NPM package Netmask impacts up to 279k projectsThe improper input validation bug, which potentially impacts up to 279,000 GitHub projects, means that parsing an IP address with a leading zero results in Netmask seeing an entirely different IP.Data-Validate-IP mitigationAlthough Data-Validate-IP doesn’t misparse octal numbers, it could still be susceptible to the Netmask flaw “depending on exactly how your code uses this distro”, said Rolsky.“This distribution returns false for any is_*_ipv4 method that includes an octal number,” explains Rolsky. “So both is_private_ipv4('010.0.0.1') and is_public_ipv4('010.0.0.1') return false.Read more of the latest SSRF attacks and exploits“I updated the documentation to explicitly recommend that you always call is_ipv4() in addition to calling a method like is_private_ipv4(),” said the developer.Rolsky also noted that Net-CIDR-Lite is currently not being maintained until a new volunteer is found.Other CPAN modules used for working with IP addresses and netmasks – Socket, Net-DNS, NetAddr-IP, Net-Subnet, and Net-Patricia – appear to be unaffected, he added.This article was updated on March 30 to reflect the discovery and remediation of another flaw in Netmask arising from a flawed patch.The Daily Swig has contacted Dave Rolsky for further comment and this article will be updated should we receive a response.RELATED Backdoor planted in PHP Git repository after server hack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/serious-netmask-vulnerability-found-to-affect-three-perl-ip-modules,"['SSRF', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'PHP', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'GitHub', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Browsers', 'Network', 'Security', 'Organizations', 'NPM', 'Node.js', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps']"
no,Nzyme: A WiFi defense system for detecting ‘bandit’ devices,Platform aims to shore up lax wireless security and eradicate WiFi spoofing attacks,"A new platform designed to detect WiFi hijacking devices has been released to the open source community.The system, dubbed ‘Nzyme’, has been published under the v1.0 moniker ‘Kyle Canyon’ on GitHub.Nzyme is the result of three years’ worth of “weekend hacking” by developer Lennart Koopmann and is described as a “free and open WiFi defense system that detects and physically locates threats using an easy to build and deploy sensor system”.WiFi attacksThere are a variety of ways to defend today’s wireless networks, including enabling WPA2 encryption, changing default password setups, and enabling firewalls. Wireless intrusion detection systems (IDS) can also be used to monitor external entry attempts.However, the developer says that current IDS solutions “fall short and are easily spoofed”, and could be broken by out-of-the-box, commercially available hacking tools.“Existing tools are focusing a lot on signature-based detection,” Koopmann told The Daily Swig. “They look for anomalies and outliers, but I found that WiFi communication is almost effortless to spoof, and anomaly detection has very high false-positive rates, especially in wireless environments.”To combat these devices, including but not limited to offerings such as the WiFi Pineapple and Pwnagotchi, Nzyme – which can be used as a portable tracker device – has built-in definitions for “out-of-the-box bandit” devices that will detect them the moment they are “powered on and in range”, the developer says.Nzyme monitors the entire WiFi spectrum in the hunt for so-called ‘bandit’ devicesUnder the HUDThe platform’s overview screen includes system status, active alerts, timestamps for intrusion or anomalies detected, probe logs, channel traffic monitoring, and fingerprint records.“Nzyme and its ‘bandits’ concept can detect many of these platforms the moment they power on, often even before an attack is executed, and then even track specific devices,” Koopmann explained.“This ability massively increases your security posture in a notoriously under-secured and easy-to-attack environment like WiFi.”RECOMMENDED Centris helps prevent supply chain attacks by flagging modified open source componentsNzyme can be tailored to use built-in definitions or custom alerts, although bandit definitions considered to be too wide-ranging may result in false positives.“A Nzyme tracker device can be used to physically locate the source of specific WiFi frames and play a big role in actively defending your perimeter,” the developer added, noting this concept is currently being explored through both LoRa and 802.11 WiFi standards.Active developmentWhen queried over the potential use of clone SSID denial-of-service (DoS) techniques in the future – or keep the software’s capabilities to alert-only – Koopmann said there are no plans, at present, to introduce “fire back” options, but the callback system for alerts will soon be upgraded to trigger local scripts which will extend Nzyme further.As a new project now in active development, naturally there are bugs and hurdles to overcome.A future improvement on the Nzyme roadmap is multi-node support and potentially the introduction of a node type that could allow sensors to be deployed to extend coverage, or perhaps go so far as to triangulate bandits.“Currently, I am looking for community feedback after this initial release,” Koopmann commented. “Nzyme is my weekend project, and all feedback and contributions are always welcome.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nzyme-a-wifi-defense-system-for-detecting-bandit-devices,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'Passwords', 'Encryption', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Authentication', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'GitHub', 'MitM']"
no,SSRF vulnerability in NPM package Netmask impacts up to 279k projects,nodejs developers urged to check their projects for vulnerable package,"UPDATED A potentially “catastrophic” security vulnerability in Netmask, an NPM package used by more than 279,000 open source projects, has been patched after lying undiscovered for nine years.The improper input validation flaw could allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to achieve server-side request forgery (SSRF) in downstream applications, according to a technical write-up published on Sunday (March 28) by security researcher Sick Codes (‘Sick.Codes’).RELATED Open source software repositories play ‘whack-a-mole’ as ‘dependency confusion’ copycats exceed 5,000Netmask, which is used to parse IPv4 CIDR blocks, was downloaded more than three million times during last week alone.Among others, the “lightweight” package is used by APIs, security software, crypto projects, and both back-end and front-end projects, according to Codes.Which dependencies are vulnerable “depends entirely on how the project uses it”, he added.Upstream originThe problem surfaced when security researchers including Codes were crafting a fix for a separate, critical, SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-28360) in downstream package Private-IP, which is used to restrict private IP addresses from interacting with an application’s internal resources.Netmask was used during the remediation process, specifically to help the researchers define IP address ranges or blocks using simpler notation.When fellow researcher Victor Viale found a second SSRF bypass in Private-IP, Codes initially “thought another developer had reverted Private-IP back to regex after we added netmask”. However, it then transpired “that only IPv6 was being filtered using regex”, and that the bypass originated upstream.‘Inordinate attack surface’The root cause of the problem turned out to be Netmask’s incorrect evaluation “of individual IPv4 octets that contain octal strings as left-stripped integers, leading to an inordinate attack surface on hundreds of thousands of projects that rely on Netmask to filter or evaluate IPv4 block ranges, both inbound and outbound”, according to a GitHub security advisory posted by Codes.The researcher described the impact as “catastrophic”, claiming the bug could also enable remote or local file inclusion attacks on certain dependencies.“There’s literally so many vulnerabilities cause[d] by this that it will make your head spin”, continued Codes.Asked for scenarios in which the bug might be exploited to achieve SSRF, the researcher cited a cloud platform with an ISO upload feature.“If that cloud uses netmask, then the user might be able to submit http://0177.0.0.1:/root/.ssh/id_rsa, and instead of the application fetching the ISO, it gets the file locally,” the researcher told The Daily Swig.This “devastating” attack “works if FTP is running”.Conversely, with certain VPNs “you could force an app to use 010.0.05, which would try to reach 10.0.0.5 on the private network, but actually that is a public IP 8.0.0.5”.Ax Sharma, security researcher at Sonatype, commented: “This highlights the need for proper input hygiene and never trusting input no matter the source.” Netmask’s fixes, he added, “now take into account that IP addresses can also be provided in octal or hexadecimal formats, something users of netmask could also have implemented on their end as an extra precaution.”Disclosure timelineThe vulnerability (CVE-2021-28918) affects Netmask v1.1.0 and below.It was discovered on March 16 and reported to the project maintainer the next day (March 17).After an initial fix inadvertently and briefly created another vulnerability, a fresh patch issued in v2.0 on March 20 then created yet another bug (CVE-2021-29418), prompting the maintainer to update again to v2.0.1, which landed on March 29.Read more of the latest news about server-side request forgeryCodes urged nodejs developers to check their projects for use of Netmask and upgrade immediately if they find the package in use.Node-netmask maintainer and Netflix engineering director Olivier Poitrey “was super responsive and worked with us on the fixes, especially in getting the first patch out literally days after we reported it”, said the researcher.Credit for analyzing and remediating the flaw is also due to security researchers Kelly Kaoudis, John Jackson, and Nick Sahler.No safety in numbersThe vulnerability is a salutary reminder of the potentially disproportionate repercussions of a serious security flaw in a single, popular open source component.Codes pointed out that the 30 billion nodejs packages installed last week were mostly downloaded by automated CI/CD pipelines and with no manual runtime inspections.The research is only the latest challenge to the misconception that, as Codes puts it, “if everyone else is using” an open source component, then “it must be” secure.Earlier in March, for instance, exploitation of the novel ‘dependency confusion’ technique led to NPM Registry and Python Package Index (PyPI) maintainers removing thousands of rogue packages that bore the same name as popular legitimate components.And Private-IP, which is downloaded around 15,000 times a week, was in the headlines for another SSRF vulnerability in November, with attackers potentially able to circumvent the package’s IP-blocking mechanism to perform multiple SSRF exploits.This article was updated on March 30 to reflect the discovery and remediation of another flaw in Netmask arising from a flawed patch.The Daily Swig has contacted the project maintainer for Netmask.

no,"5G network slicing flaws pose denial-of-service, data theft risk",Researchers urge telco industry to improve authentication controls before widespread deployment,"Security researchers have discovered significant flaws in the architecture of 5G network slicing and virtualization technology.More specifically, AdaptiveMobile Security uncovered three vulnerabilities in the way 5G uses OAuth to provision network slicing.Network slicing allows a mobile operator to divide their network into multiple distinct virtual blocks that provide different amounts of resources and prioritization to different types of traffic.A slice is a logical block in the 5G core network assigned to machine-to-machine communication, private networks, streaming, automotive, or a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO).RECOMMENDED Isn’t it ironic: Exploiting GDPR laws to gain access to personal dataUsing network slicing to provision different types of telecom service will be as important for mobile network security as using virtualization has become in allocating data center service, at least once 5G becomes more mainstream.However, because of shortcomings in authentication, particular networks slices can get a lot more access than they should be able to, meaning that the compromise of any network node could have a spill-over effect.The damage doneA compromised network node might be abused to crash network segments and extract user data, such as location information. AdaptiveMobile Security has identified three specific risks that stem from authentication shortcomings:User data extraction through location tracking attacksDenial of service against another network functionAccess to a network function and related information of another verticalDuring the research, AdaptiveMobile Security researchers looked at 5G core networks that contain both shared and dedicated network functions.They discovered that when a network has these ‘hybrid’ network functions that support several slices there is a lack of mapping between the application and transport layers identities.An attacker who had gained access to an edge network function could potentially exploit security shortcoming in current 5G industry standards to gain access to both the operator’s core network and the network slices of other enterprises.According to AdaptiveMobile Security, the “probability of attack is only currently low due to the limited number of mobile operators with multiple live network slices on their networks”.Dr Silke Holtmanns, head of 5G security research at AdaptiveMobile Security, told The Daily Swig that the flaws are all actually “classical API authentication and authorization (telco OWASP)” issues, just with a 5G spin.Holtmanns explained: “Identities in different parts of the messages need to be cross-checked for consistency. But of course, this is not as easy as it sounds. 5G is complex.”CountermeasuresAdaptiveMobile Security said that it has been working in conjunction with the GSMA, operators and standards bodies to address the issue and update architectures to prevent exploitation.In a research paper (registration required), AdaptiveMobile Security outlines its three-part recipe for improving the security of 5G network slicing.First, authorization needs to be fine grained enough so that one cannot impersonate another user or network slice, a relatively easy fix.Read more of the latest infosec research from around the worldSecond, the receiving node needs to be able to validate information across layers. And lastly, networks need to take security into use and be configured accordingly.5G security builds on, and is largely compatible with, key functions and frameworks developed in earlier technologies. Although 5G is more secure than 4G, it’s also a lot more complex and AdapativeMobile Security is far from the first to flag up potential problems.For example, two years ago security researchers at Purdue University and the University of Iowa detailed security flaws that might potentially be abused to track a victim’s real-time location, spoof emergency alerts, or silently disconnect a 5G-connected phone from the network.RELATED 5G creates ‘SIM-jacking on steroids’ threat",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/5g-network-slicing-flaws-pose-denial-of-service-data-theft-risk,"['Telecommunications', 'Mobile', 'IoT', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Network', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques']"
no,Backdoor planted in PHP Git repository after server hack,Scripting language falls victim to cyber-attack,"An unknown actor compromised the official PHP Git repository last night (March 28), pushing backdoored code under the guise of a minor edit.The malicious attacker pushed two commits to the php-src repo for the popular scripting language that contained a backdoor allowing for remote code execution (RCE), maintainers revealed.PHP is thought to underpin almost 80% of websites, according to a study by Web Technology Surveys. This includes all WordPress sites, which are built on PHP.It is so far unknown who the perpetrator was or how they were able to publish the commits, since they were uploaded under legitimate maintainers’ names.However, it is known that the malicious actor pushed the changes under an upstream named ‘fix typo’, apparently trying to cover their tracks by claiming they were making minor changes to the code.Read more of the latest news about remote code executionDigging deeper, the code actually planted a backdoor that opened the door for the remote takeover of any website that uses PHP.Maintainer Nikita Popov wrote in a statement that they believe attackers found a way in through compromise of the git.php.net server rather than any individual account.The team behind PHP has discontinued the git.php.net server and the repositories on GitHub, which were previously only mirrors, will become canonical, they said.This means that changes should be pushed directly to GitHub rather than to git.php.net.Maintainers are now reviewing the repositories for any signs of further compromise.Mistaken identityThe malicious code includes reference to ‘Zerodium’, a US company known for buying zero-day exploits.This has sparked conversation online as the cybersecurity community scrambles to determine who is behind the attack.Twitter user @LiveOverflow suggested that the mention could be a joke, tweeting: “What’s your guess regarding the “Zerodium” reference?

Fake vaccines are the latest in these scams, which is why INTERPOL and HSI are warning the public to be extra vigilant,” said Interpol secretary general Jürgen Stock.“Anyone ordering a vaccine online rather than obtaining it from their national provider, will be buying a fake product.”HSI assistant director Steve Francis added: “HSI and its law enforcement partners will vigorously investigate and seek prosecution for criminals taking advantage of the public’s quest for COVID-19 vaccinations and those who endanger the lives of the very people the vaccines are intended to protect”.Law enforcement fightbackThe warning follows Interpol’s announcement on March 3 that South African authorities had made four arrests following the seizure of 2,400 doses of fake Covid-19 vaccines. Elsewhere, a raid conducted by Chinese police resulted in the arrest of 80 suspects and seizure of more than 3,000 counterfeit vaccines.Submitting pre-orders for vaccines, and paying for them with bitcoins among other payment processing methods, can also put victims’ finances and personal data at risk, the agencies warned.In December 2020, for example, HSI seized two phishing websites parading as the legitimate domains of biotechnology companies involved in developing Covid-19 treatments.And in August, the US Department of Justice shut down 300 fraudulent websites that failed to fulfil orders for scarce products such as hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes even after taking payments.Read more of the latest coronavirus security newsThe UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has also played a pivotal role in the law enforcement fightback against Covid-themed scams, disrupting more than 15,000 coronavirus-themed phishing campaigns between March and August 2020.Interpol secretary general Jürgen Stock said the law enforcement response must be transnational if criminal networks with “global ambitions” are to be dismantled. In recognition of this, Interpol created a Global Financial Crime Task Force (IGFCTF) last year.Fake test resultsA report released yesterday (March 25) by threat intel firm Intsights warned of a burgeoning black market for fake test result documents that could be used to dodge quarantine restrictions when travelling or before returning to work.“It is unclear if these criminal vendors are abusing the legitimate access of malicious insiders, breaching networks to gain unauthorized access to infrastructure that produces legitimate testing documents, or using some other unidentified means,” said the report.Intsights also noted that businesses offering Covid-19 tests or demanding proof of customers’ testing or vaccination status as a condition of travel or entry to premises were seeing an “increase in the volume of protected health information (PHI) stored in or transiting through their networks”.Health-related data is often more sought after by cybercriminals than payment card information, it warned.DON’T FORGET TO READ EU cybersecurity strategy: Coronavirus, supply chain attacks highlight ‘lack of coordination’ among member states",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/fake-covid-19-vaccines-pose-serious-health-hazard-warns-interpol,"['Coronavirus', 'Fraud', 'Phishing', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Malware', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Privacy', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Email', 'Security', 'Organizations', 'Government', 'Healthcare', 'Retail', 'E-Commerce', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Research', 'Europe', 'North', 'America', 'US', 'Legal']"

no,Isn’t it ironic: Exploiting GDPR laws to gain access to personal data,Research shows how data protection systems are vulnerable to attack,"A security researcher has detailed how they were able to exploit GDPR laws to leak sensitive personal information from the systems put in place to protect it.Full-time bug bounty hunter Hx01 detailed how they were able to gain access to personally identifiable information (PII) stored by various organizations including Fortune 500 companies.The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced across the EU in May 2018 to safeguard citizens’ data.Under the sweeping legislation, individuals can use a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) to access information that an organization is processing about them.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsHowever, as Hx01 found, many of these organizations are exposed to DSAR vulnerabilities and exploits “ranging from lack of email confirmations to an SSTI affecting multiple organizations”, meaning that an unauthorized attacker could gain access to private data.ImpersonationOne vulnerability Hx01 found was unauthenticated DSAR forms. DSAR portals allow users to make changes to the data an organization holds on them, which can be done on an online form.In some instances, unauthenticated users could submit a form asking for data to be removed or changed without having to verify themselves by email.This means that an individual’s data can be modified by an impersonator, who can also go as far as deleting their information or account.BACKGROUND GDPR: Have greater fines forced organizations to take data security seriously?The security researcher also detailed how an off-the-shelf DSAR platform used by 6,000 organizations, including Fortune 500 companies, was vulnerable to server-side template injection (SSTI) attacks, which could be used to confirm requests as a victim.Added to this, companies accepting DSAR requests through email channels would often process the request without vetting it, allowing an attacker to spoof emails on behalf of the victim and send a DSAR request due to a lack of email authentication.This meant that requests looked legitimate and were processed accordingly.ImpactSpeaking to The Daily Swig, Hx01 said: “The impact of the findings varied from organization to organization, for example a background checking firm would send back a candidate’s full SSN with other PII information, whereas an organization would delete all of the project files and integrations permanently without confirming with the customer.”They added: “If exploited at large this could’ve been used for stealing/deleting/modifying the victim’s PII.“Ironically GDPR laws were made to protect users’ private data, however they could be abused to exfiltrate users’ private data.“Mitigation would include proper vetting of the DSAR before moving forward with the request.”A more detailed explanation of how to mitigate against these vulnerabilities can be found in a technical write-up (PDF) from Hx01.READ MORE European Data Protection Board lays out data breach notification guidelines for organizations",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/isnt-it-ironic-exploiting-gdpr-laws-to-gain-access-to-personal-data,"['GDPR', 'SSTI', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Organizations', 'Europe', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Privacy', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Authentication', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Database', 'Security', 'Legal', 'Email', 'Security']"
no,Security researcher launches GoFundMe campaign to fight legal threat over vulnerability disclosure,"More than £8,000 has been raised after UK healthcare foundation allegedly threatened to take legal action","A security researcher has launched a GoFundMe campaign to secure legal representation after a responsible disclosure notice apparently went sour.In a tweet dated March 8, Rob Dyke, an open source cybersecurity specialist and platform engineer, said he had discovered open code repositories in late February containing API keys, application code, usernames, passwords, and the URLs of third-party, embedded items.Two open GitHub repositories were said to have been exposed online for two years, leaving plenty of scope for threat actors to exploit the information posted.After verifying the contents and taking screenshots, the security researcher sent a private security advisory to the repo author – a common practice in responsible disclosure.Dyke alerted the author to the public settings of the repositories and also warned that the application code contained within was based on an old PHP framework containing SQL injection and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.The researcher added that he would keep the materials, in an encrypted fashion, for 90 days before destroying the records.At first, the author thanked Dyke and took down the repos. However, some of the embedded elements were still available on public URLs, leading to a second private disclosure.Dyke, once again, was thanked – but was also hit with a notice to serve from the organization’s legal team in the same breath.Dyke was accused of committing offenses under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.‘Sensible and responsible disclosure’According to the researcher, an unnamed legal team demanded that he “give commitments that amounted to me acknowledging that I had unlawfully hacked into and penetrated systems and databases”.“I made a sensible and responsible disclosure; I have not made threats at any time; nor have I intimated harm to the organization’s systems,” Dyke said.RECOMMENDED Xerox legal threat reportedly silences researcher at Infiltrate security conferenceWhen asked on social media exactly what he was accused of, Dyke said, “clicking links from one public website to another. Then telling the organization that I clicked the links”.In a follow-up tweet dated March 9, Dyke posted:“Might need a little help later today. Just letting folks know. #NHSbuntu #nhos #nhsopensource.”GoFundMe campaignDyke did not originally disclose the name of the organization that threatened legal action as private information was still available online. However, the researcher did say, “If you knew who it was you’d be very disappointed”.On March 9, Dyke sent out a request for recommendations for a lawyer familiar with technology and able to represent him, as well as roughly £1,500 to pay their fees.A GoFundMe page was created to help cover these costs, and at the time of writing, £8,625 has been raised. Any donations that are not required for Dyke’s legal defense will be donated to Code Your Future.The researcher has engaged a legal firm to act on his behalf.“This is shitty bullying behavior from the organization,” Dyke said on March 9. “I won’t be identifying the organization. Suffice to say that they have a pile of public money that should be spent on doing Good Open Source Things rather than shooting the messenger.”On March 24, Dyke named and confirmed to The Daily Swig that the organization as the Apperta Foundation, a clinical non-profit funded by the UK National Health Service (NHS).In an email screenshot shared online, the researcher revealed a message allegedly sent by Northumbria Police who has requested to speak to him. The request for contact cited “a report of Computer Misuse”.“I told @AppertaUK about passwords/keys/finace db they published on Github,” Dyke commented. “And this is what I get #cyberup”.In response to a series of queries from The Daily Swig, an Apperta Foundation spokesperson issued the following statement:On or about 26 February 2021, it is understood that an unauthorised individual or individuals breached a private portal to access financial information related to The Apperta Foundation. After taking professional advice, the Foundation took immediate action to isolate this breach and secure its systems.The information implicated related purely to The Apperta Foundation’s financial information. We can assure the community that personal data was not targeted or accessed about individuals. The Foundation’s directors have a responsibility to protect its confidential information, including data and intellectual property owned by the Apperta Foundation. Its actions have been entirely proportionate to that responsibility.The Apperta Foundation’s management is confident that all systems and security have been reviewed and all necessary steps have been taken to ensure the Apperta Foundation is protected and future threats are managed in accordance with best practice.READ MORE Computer Misuse Act: Most UK cybersecurity pros fear breaking the law by simply doing their jobs",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-researcher-launches-gofundme-campaign-to-fight-legal-threat-over-vulnerability-disclosure,"['Research', 'Legal', 'UK', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Healthcare', 'Europe', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Passwords', 'Encryption', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'RCE', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise']"
no,Cloudflare launches JavaScript dependency dashboard utility to warn against Magecart-style malfeasance,Script Monitor aims to skittle skimmers,"UPDATED Cloudflare has launched a tool designed to help thwart Magecart-style payment card skimming attacks.Starting in 2015, cybercriminal groups have stolen payment card details from Magento applications by infecting third-party plugins with malicious code.Victims of Magecart-style software supply chain attacks have included Ticketmaster, Newegg, British Airways, and more.Shields UpIn response, Cloudflare has launched Script Monitor, a tool to record a site’s JavaScript dependencies in order to pick up potentially malicious changes that can be the tell-tale signs of Magecart attacks.Script Monitor – available as a beta version – is the first available component of Page Shield, a client-side security product from Cloudflare that debuted on Thursday (March 25).Script Monitor analyzes legitimate third party code on a website and alerts a customer when any new code is added, or existing code is tampered with.Catch up on the latest Magecart (card skimmer) security newsJohn Graham-Cumming, CTO at Cloudflare, told The Daily Swig that at least initially it will be up to customers to determine whether or not JavaScript dependencies that appear on dashboards are good or bad.“The initial release of Page Shield will generate a dependency report available both via the dashboard and via API that will include links to the relevant JavaScript files that have been detected,” Graham-Cumming explained. “The aim is to provide visibility into these dependencies at launch, and to augment the report with signals from Cloudflare to identify malicious vs [versus] non malicious in the next iteration.”According to Cloudflare, existing browser technologies such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and Sub-Resource Integrity (SRI) provide some protection against client-side threats but have some drawbacks that its Script Monitor is able to overcome.Because of Cloudflare’s unique position between application origin servers and end-users, we can modify responses before they reach end-users. In this case, we’re adding an additional Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only header to pages as they pass through our edge.When JavaScript files attempt to execute on the page, browsers will send a report back to Cloudflare. As we are using a report-only header, there’s no requirement for application owners to maintain allowlists for relevant insights.For each report we see, we compare the JavaScript file with the historic dependencies of that zone and check if the file is new. If it is, we fire an alert so customers can investigate and determine whether the change was expected.Page Shield is already configurable to some extent but Cloudflare plans to further refine this aspect of the technology in order to avoid bombarding users with too many alerts.Graham-Cumming said: “As we develop the product further, we plan to expand both the alerting capabilities and the data available in the reports to highlight malicious vs [versus] non-malicious changes according to our detection mechanisms.”Catch up on the latest browser security newsClient-side security is only one part of web application security, according to Graham-Cumming, who added that a defence-in-depth approach is required.“Enterprises should approach the problem holistically and consider compatibility with other must have solutions such as WAF, API protections, SSL management, and so forth,” Graham-Cumming concluded. “Cloudflare's solutions are all fully compatible with each other.”Randeep Bahia, a security consultant involved in helping e-commerce site defend against Magecart-style attacks, told The Daily Swig that Cloudflare's technology will likely take time to mature into something effective.""[It] looks as though the initial release is basically a report only CSP, tracking changes over time, and alerting/ notifying on new resources detected,"" Bahia commented on Twitter. ""I can imagine that creating a lot of noise.. for users. Some of the future stuff sounds cool.""Page Shield, of which Script Shield is the first available component, is part of Cloudflare’s broader push into client-side security. Earlier this week, Cloudflare launched Remote Browser Isolation as a means for customers to mitigate client-side attacks in workers’ browsers.This story has been updated to add comment from security consultant Randeep BahiaRELATED Magecart attacks in 2021: Cat-and-mouse game continues between cybercrooks, researchers, law enforcement",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cloudflare-launches-javascript-dependency-dashboard-utility-to-warn-against-magecart-style-malfeasance,"['Cloudflare', 'E-Commerce', 'Browsers', 'JavaScript', 'Edge', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Cybercrime', 'Industry', 'News']"

no,"H2C smuggling proves effective against Azure, Cloudflare Access, and more","However, Google Cloud Platform repelled security researchers’ attack","UPDATED Security researchers have harnessed the novel ‘H2C smuggling’ technique to achieve authentication, routing, and WAF bypasses on a number of leading cloud platforms.The attack’s first in-the-wild scalps included routing and WAF bypasses in Microsoft Azure, and an authentication bypass in Cloudflare Access, although Google Cloud Platform emerged unscathed.The technique’s architects, from security firm Bishop Fox, noted in a landmark write-up that load balancers such as AWS ALB/CLB, NGINX, and Apache Traffic Server, blocked H2C smuggling because they “won’t forward the required headers for a compliant H2C connection upgrade”, reads a blog post from security monitoring platform Assetnote.BACKGROUND H2C smuggling named top web hacking technique of 2020However, Bishop Fox had also noted that “not all backends were compliant, and we could test with the non-compliant Connection: Upgrade variant, where the HTTP2-Settings value is omitted from the Connection header,” according to Assetnote engineering lead Sean Yeoh.Reengineering Bishop Fox’s h2cSmuggler tool accordingly, Assetnote researchers managed to find “multiple instances of off-the-shelf configured services that permitted H2C upgrades”, paving the way to authorization control bypasses “on interim reverse proxies”.What are H2C smuggling attacks?Unveiled in September 2020, HTTP/2 cleartext (H2C) smuggling “abuses H2C-unaware front-ends to create a tunnel to backend systems, enabling attackers to bypass frontend rewrite rules and exploit internal HTTP headers,” James Kettle, head of research at PortSwigger Web Security*, has said.Kettle made the comments after the attack was revealed to be the top web hacking technique of 2020.H2C, a deprecated protocol, upgrades a regular, transient plaintext HTTP connection to a persistent connection using the HTTP2 binary protocol. And when a HTTP request issued to a reverse proxy “includes a Connection: Upgrade header the proxy maintains the persistent connection, and scope for continuous communication, between the client and server”, explained Yeoh.“Using H2C Smuggling, we can bypass [routing] rules a reverse proxy uses when processing requests such as path-based routing, authentication, or the WAF processing provided we can establish a H2C connection first.”Microsoft AzureMicrosoft Azure presented “the most interesting use case for impact,” said Yeoh, because “the Azure Application Gateways offer the ability to attach the Azure WAF to the gateway.”With the access gateway removing HTTP2-Settings from the Upgrade header but leaving the others “untouched”, the researchers were able to bypass routing rules.But “more importantly, when the Azure WAF is configured, this provides a global WAF bypass provided your first request does not get blocked by the WAF and you can establish a H2C connection”.Yeoh praised Microsoft for ensuring “a painless and smooth process” despite the difficulty of applying security fixes without disrupting the customer experience.Cloudflare AccessRules applied by Cloudflare Access, an authentication service enforced by Cloudflare’s load balancer, were bypassed because request proxying “modified the Upgrade header to exclude HTTP2-Settings” but retained the other headers.Alerted via their bug bounty program, Cloudflare “were very responsive” in fixing the flaw, despite having to “balance customer expectations around servicing H2C connections”, said Yeoh.Google Cloud PlatformAlthough Google’s load balancer permits configuration of basic routing rules, an attempted HTTP upgrade prompts the load balancer to strip “all Connection and HTTP2-Settings headers”, thus blocking a connection upgrade – and H2C smuggling attacks.All other vulnerable cloud platforms denied Assetnote permission to disclose the details.Lessons learnedTo find these bypasses, researchers configured a server that upgraded both non-compliant and compliant H2C connections and found a load balancer configurable with routing rules or features.Even though they used a non-compliant server, Yeoh pointed out that developers “may not understand the internals of their reverse proxies/internal services hosted behind the load balancer and hence may be vulnerable even if their load balancer is configured properly.”That Jake Miller of Bishop Fox had surmised that major cloud providers would be invulnerable to H2C smuggling demonstrated “that even the best security researchers make [incorrect] assumptions about their research or may not have the time needed to find all affected parties”, concluded Yeoh.Read more on the latest hacking techniques“Consequently, even when research is made public there are often plenty of opportunities to extend and further the research.”Assetnote’s investigation also demonstrates that security measures on the load balancer alone “can be insufficient when restricting access or securing your application”, the researcher added.Nevertheless, he acknowledged the difficulty of keeping abreast of “these nuanced configuration issues, particularly across a large and fluid cloud attack surface”.Asked what most be the most fruitful direction for further H2C smuggling research research, Yeoh told The Daily Swig that “there are a number of interesting avenues worth exploring”, in particular “H2C smuggling in the context of Kubernetes ingress and services”.This article was updated on March 25 with the addition of further comments from Sean Yeoh of Assetnote.*Disclosure: PortSwigger is The Daily Swig’s parent companyRELATED Google awards Uruguayan researcher $133,337 top prize in cloud security competition",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/h2c-smuggling-proves-effective-against-azure-cloudflare-access-and-more,"['Research', 'WAF', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Microsoft', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Edge', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Compliance', 'Authentication', 'Industry', 'News', 'Google', 'Cloudflare', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security']"
no,Mozilla tightens Firefox’s HTTP referrer header controls to boost privacy,Most of the web now protected against one class of information disclosure vulnerability,"The majority of the web is now protected against information disclosure exploits that leverage the HTTP referrer header after Mozilla announced a privacy-focused Firefox update.Launched yesterday (March 23), Firefox 87 marks the debut of a stricter, more privacy-preserving default Referrer Policy, according to Mozilla.“From now on, by default, Firefox will trim path and query string information from referrer headers to prevent sites from accidentally leaking sensitive user data,” the company said in a blog post.Points of referenceHistorically browsers sent the HTTP referrer header to let a website know which location ‘referred’ a user to that website.A Referrer Policy adopted by browser-makers around five years ago gave improved privacy in transitions from HTTPS websites but this has been superseded by even tighter controls.RELATED Browser security briefing: Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a ‘post-XSS world’The new “stricter referrer policy will not only trim information for requests going from HTTPS to HTTP, but will also trim path and query information for all cross-origin requests,” Mozilla explained.Google introduced a similar new default Referrer Policy for Chrome last December.The new default behaviour is to show the referrer partially, but it can be customized by the application to keep backwards compatibility, as Google’s documentation for developers explains.On SafariApple’s Safari browser did something comparable with a technology called Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP), also released last December.ITP “downgrades all cross-site request referrer headers to just the page’s origin” instead of redacting cross-site requests to classified domains, according to Apple.Read more of the latest browser security newsThese improved security controls by Apple extend to browsers on mobile devices running on iOS, such as iPhones and iPads.The changes by browser makers collectively address a class of information disclosure via HTTP referrer header vulnerability.RECOMMENDED DuckDuckGo’s Daniel Davis discusses the privacy-focused search engine’s future in the market",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/mozilla-tightens-firefoxs-http-referrer-header-controls-to-boost-privacy,"['Browsers', 'firefox', 'Mobile', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Google', 'Chrome', 'Mozilla', 'Apple', 'Safari', 'Privacy', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News']"

Were we ready to react collectively? We were not’,"“Cyber weapons are a reality, and cyber defense is a dream,” asserted Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of antivirus giant Kaspersky, discussing the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade at an online seminar yesterday (March 23).Launched in December last year, the strategy aims to reinforce collective resilience against cyber threats – meaning cooperation is key. But in a year that saw ransomware and a plethora of other attacks increasing around the world, the response wasn’t always as coordinated as it might have been, said Bart Groothuis, member of the European Parliament and rapporteur on the EU’s Security of Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2).“What struck me was that all their command-and-control servers were being used by the actors at the time, and we knew about it, right? But it wasn’t being shared. It was being shared passively, but there was no active component,” he said. “I was annoyed that we knew about the command-and-control servers, but there was no DNS company that would act to stop the attack, while it would be very obvious to do so. I’d like to see a more active component in our European cybersecurity posture.”Emergency responseLorena Boix Alonso, director for digital society, trust, and cybersecurity for the European Commission’s DG Connect department, said that this lack of coordination among EU member states had been apparent during the Covid-19 pandemic.“Everybody knew that the pandemic was coming. Were we ready to react collectively? We were not,” she said, adding that there was a good case for a new cyber unit focused on preparing for emergencies.“We need it because we need to be ready, so that our existing operational capabilities are fit for purpose in case surprises happen,” she said.Securing the software supply chainAlonso also called for an increased focus on supply chain security. “We are… looking at other proposals to require every company as part of their cybersecurity risk management activities to look also at the vendors and manufacturers they are dealing with to be part of the risk management program,” she said.RELATED Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowAnd Susana Asensio, member of the board of directors of the Industrial Cybersecurity Center in Spain, said that security-by-design was not always being implemented, especially when it comes to operational technologies rather than IT.And this, she said, could come back to bite organizations in years to come.“We are aware of many digital systems that are not included in cybersecurity requirements from the design stage,” she said.“These will be legacy systems in a few years, and to be honest I don’t think most will be able to afford to replace them in the short term.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/eu-cybersecurity-strategy-coronavirus-supply-chain-attacks-highlight-lack-of-coordination-among-member-states,"['Europe', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Industry', 'News', 'Privacy', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Ransomware', 'DNS', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Spain', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'IoT', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Coronavirus']"

no,Explainer: What does the UK’s Integrated Review mean for cybersecurity?,Stephen Pritchard sheds light on the government’s new defense strategy,"The UK government recently unveiled its new defense, security, and foreign policy strategy. It is billed as the most comprehensive review since the end of the Cold War.But what is the ‘Integrated Review’, and how does information security fit in to the country’s overall defense strategy?Military and cyber warfare specialist Stephen Pritchard, writing for The Daily Swig, answers all this, and more.What is the Integrated Review?The paper, Global Britain in a Competitive Age: The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (or the ‘Integrated Review’), brings together the UK government’s thinking on defense, foreign policy, overseas aid, and security.As well as the review, a military-focused ‘command paper’, Defence in a Competitive Age, was published on March 22.BACKGROUND UK defense and foreign policy review places ‘cyber’ front and centerThe Integrated Review puts much greater emphasis on cybersecurity and cyber defense. The government is also creating a new, integrated National Cyber Force, drawing personnel from the military, intelligence services, and GCHQ.The review also sets out the UK’s priorities in areas such as artificial intelligence and robotic and drone technologies, all of which are set to play a greater role in defense.Why is ‘cyber’ now viewed as one of the domains of defense?NATO named cybersecurity as one of the domains of defense, alongside land, sea, air, and space, in 2016. Potentially, a cyber-attack on a NATO country could trigger a collective response from the alliance, under Article 5 of its treaty.Adversaries could aim cyber-attacks directly against military targets – knocking out communications systems – or use them to gather intelligence, or to attack industry or other supporting civilian infrastructure.The scope of cyber-attacks is broad, and defense involvement is inevitable, according to Professor Vladlena Benson, director of the Cyber Security Innovation Centre and board member of the UK Central Chapter at ISACA, a security industry association.“It is clear that the new domains of cyber space yield new landscapes for cyber warfare. The new battlefields of information supremacy have manifested themselves in the destructive political influences leading to economic and democratic process disruptions across the cyberspace,” Benson told The Daily Swig.“Further, the latest attempts to compromise the [Covid-19] vaccine development process shows how disruptive and diverse the threats are. The latter also presents a challenge to physical defenses and the defense across multiple fronts against state-sponsored APTs.”The UK’s Integrated Review placed cybersecurity front and centerHow is the UK government proposing to strengthen its cyber defenses?The UK is moving away from so-called ‘sunset’ capabilities, including older fighter jets, warships, and armored vehicles, and towards investment in new technologies.At the tactical level, newer equipment, including the F-35 fighter and the Ajax armored reconnaissance vehicle, include powerful sensors and data-sharing capabilities.Higher up, military leaders talk about “information maneuver”, or using data and information for strategic advantage. The army will have information maneuver groups, and also created a dedicated cyber unit last year.Most significantly, the new National Cyber Force will handle both offensive and defensive information security operations.Read more of the latest UK cybersecurity newsAlthough most of the funding for the new organization comes from defense, it will also combat terrorism and serious organized crime, and share expertise with government bodies and civilian companies.“The armed forces have already been engaging with cyberspace for years; the creation of the National Cyber Force has just helped to bring more public attention to this,” Dr Francis Gaffney, director of threat intelligence and response at Mimecast, told The Daily Swig.“The National Cyber Force creates a way for organizations like the armed forces to combine their resources and talent with other governmental bodies. This should, in theory, give them wider capabilities as they pool together their intelligence and develop targeted strategies to defend the nation.”What does the government mean when it says the UK needs to be “at the forefront of global regulation on technology, cyber, digital, and data”?The UK government has reiterated its commitment to the rules-based system of international relations.Laws governing information security and cybercrime, though, vary widely from country to country. Pursuing attackers across borders, let alone prosecuting them, remains difficult.As far back as 2013, the UK admitted to an offensive cyber capability. This is one of the roles of the National Cyber Force. According to RUSI, the defense and foreign policy think tank, this should be no surprise – cyber capabilities are an evolution of battlefield tactics such as jamming communications.LONG READS Declassified: GCHQ celebrates 100 years of secrets well keptBut the UK will need to work with other countries including NATO allies, neutral, and even hostile powers if it is to create ‘rules of war’ for cyberspace, and stronger laws to deter cybercrime.Doing so, though, could in turn help the UK’s information security sector.“With global losses from cybercrime now totaling over $1 trillion, it’s clear just how important it is for the country and its local businesses to prioritize cybersecurity and shore up their defenses,” Adam Philpott, EMEA president at McAfee, told The Daily Swig.“This is why the increased importance placed on cybersecurity in the UK’s Integrated Review is promising news for the future of this country.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/explainer-what-does-the-uks-integrated-review-mean-for-cybersecurity,"['UK', 'Government', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Research', 'Analysis', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'AI', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'Coronavirus', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Privacy', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Fraud', 'Legal', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Facebook awards $55k bug bounty for third-party vulnerabilities that could compromise its internal network,Two vulnerabilities could be chained to lead to server-side request forgery,"A security researcher has been awarded a $55,000 bug bounty after they chained a pair of vulnerabilities in an unnamed third-party application to achieve server-side request forgery (SSRF) and compromise Facebook’s internal network.Alaa Abdulridha demonstrated how authentication cookies used by the application could be manipulated to compromise accounts belonging to Facebook employees, before exploiting a flaw in the application’s form-building feature to access intern.our.facebook.com.A few days previously, he also found an “unsecured API which allowed [him] to change the password of any admin account with no user interaction”, again potentially leading to the takeover of accounts registered by Facebook employees, as outlined in the first of two blog posts documenting the findings.Catch up on the latest bug bounty newsAbdulridha told The Daily Swig that he considered all three vulnerabilities to have low complexity but high impact.The discoveries earned him a total of $54,800 in bug bounty payouts, with the SSRF chain alone – documented in a second blog post – netting him $47,000.In awarding the cybersecurity engineer this bumper bounty, Facebook’s security team acknowledged that the SSRF vulnerability “could have allowed a highly sophisticated attacker to perform HTTP requests into our network and read our responses”.Changing the passwordAbdulridha targeted the same subdomain – https://legal.tapprd.thefacebook.com – with a 2019 RCE exploit that netted another researcher $1,000.After finding a way to bypass a redirect to the single sign-on (SSO) page, fuzzing on a ‘forgot password’ endpoint exposed a ‘save password’ endpoint that was “expecting a POST request”.His efforts to manually change a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) token in the JavaScript files failed because, he suspected, an email might be incorrect.Using Burp Intruder, he then tried a list of email permutations in a bid to hit upon an admin password and generated “the same error results plus one other result” – a 302 redirect to the login page.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE GitHub awards bug bounty hunter $25,000 for Actions secrets theft reportThe successful email and password combination allowed him access to the admin account.The researcher bolstered his discovery by writing “a quick and simple” python script that, if incorporating the email and new password, changes the password.ASPXAUTH cookieThe application also used ASPXAUTH cookies, which he suspected might be susceptible to the same manipulation he had previously used successfully on other bug bounty programs, because most applications using the authentication cookie include only the email or username and expiration time in the encryption keys.After a Google search uncovered another website that used the application and the same encryption keys, the researcher successfully registered with a Facebook admin username, “intercepted the request and took the ASPXAUTH and replaced it with the Facebook expired ASPXAUTH”.Thus, an account used by a Facebook employee could be compromised, proving he could “login using any admin account just by knowing the username”.The Facebook bug bounty team awarded $55k for the two vulnerabilitiesAbdulridha recommends that developers using ASP.net should ensure that ASPXAUTH cookies are stored in the database, validated by the application, and contain more than the username for further validation. Encryption and decryption keys should be changed from their default settings.Canary token in the coalmineThe researcher suspected that a critical SSRF was likely present in the application’s form-designing feature, which had “an option to call an external API called ‘API Trigger’, for example to call graph.facebook.com by using the access token of your Facebook account”.By surfacing Facebook’s canary token, he validated SSRF and the threat of arbitrary command execution and to data “either in the vulnerable application itself or on other back-end systems” in Facebook’s internal network “that the application can communicate with”.This might also “result in malicious onward attacks that appear to originate from the organization hosting the vulnerable application, leading to potential legal liabilities and reputational damage,” he added.Abdulridha reported the first vulnerability on August 28, 2020, and it was fixed on October 2. A report for the other two flaws was submitted on September 9, and the bug pairs were partially mitigated on October 26 and fully fixed on February 25, 2021.Facebook told the researcher that it had found no evidence of abuse.Asked to comment further by The Daily Swig, Abdulridha simply urged: “Bug hunters around the world – never give up on the target.”RELATED Oculus, Facebook account takeovers net security researcher $30,000 bug bounty",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/facebook-awards-55k-bug-bounty-for-third-party-vulnerabilities-that-could-compromise-its-internal-network,"['Facebook', 'SSRF', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Privacy', 'API', 'Edge', 'RCE', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'CSRF', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Encryption', 'Social', 'Media', 'Secure', 'Development', 'JavaScript', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Industry', 'News', 'Research']"
no,Space jam: Researchers and satellite start-ups meet to discuss celestial cybersecurity,"Space industry can no longer rely on ‘security through obscurity’, Cysat ’21 delegates hear","UPDATED Satellite operators can no longer ignore cyber risks when designing new satellites or support systems, delegates to the first European event dedicated to satellite cybersecurity heard last week.The Cysat ’21 conference brought together ethical hackers and security researchers with space start-ups and decision-makers from the space industry.End of an eraJames Pavur, a security researcher and Oxford University PhD student who has done extensive research into satellite broadband security risks, told The Daily Swig that the era when satellite systems were beyond the reach of hackers is coming to an end.“Satellite systems used to be made up of expensive kit, about which there was not much info, that were highly customised and bespoke,” Pavur explained.Despite the glamorous allure of getting into satellite systems, malicious hackers were effectively dissuaded from chancing their arm by “security through obscurity” – something the space industry can no longer count on after borrowing standardized hardware and software development practices from IoT and enterprise systems, according to Pavur.Security incidents involving satellite systems have historically involved breaking into Windows computers in ground stations (“the weakest link”, said Pavur) but now more thought is being put into radio frequency exploits.Immature practicesThis is a concern for the future because some in the space industry still transmit telemetry protocols with no cryptographic protections.“We’re better at understanding how to secure ground computers than how to secure satellites,” according to Pavur.Ignacio Chechile, CTO at space start-up ReOrbit, backed up Pavur’s assessment that immature cybersecurity practices were common in the space industry by referring to one unnamed operator that used Telnet to communicate with a satellite over an unencrypted CCSDS link.DON’T FORGET TO READ Cybersecurity conferences 2021: A schedule of virtual, and potentially in-person or ‘hybrid’, eventsThis is an area of potential exposure because a hobbyist can now, for just a few hundred euros, buy hardware that would allow them to track a satellite. An accessible physical layer plus vulnerabilities and no patching is a recipe for potential trouble, Chechile warned.Other speakers at Cysat urged the adoption of an onion-like approach featuring multiple layers of protection, compartmentalization, and redundancy as a defence against potential attack.Work along these lines has already been undertaken in segments of the space industry, where best practices and solutions for securing satellite communications are been developed.Hack-a-SatOne of the most promising initiatives in the arena is the US Air Force’s satellite hacking challenge, Hack-a-Sat, which took place virtually as part of last year’s DEF CON.Xavier Hehrenberger and Aris Adamantiadis, two ethical hackers who took part in the competition, reaching its final round as part of the SolarWine team, spoke with enthusiasm about the event, which they hope will be repeated.Also at Cysat, Eoin Carroll and Christiaan Beek, researchers from McAfee who mapped out the space threat landscape in a pair of blog posts (here and here) last year, explained how lessons from terrestrial security systems can be applied to secure space-based systems.No air gapWhile sending a system into space might seem like a way to create the ultimate air gap, real-world attacks have still taken place.In 2008, for instance, the Johnson Space Centre was infected with malware which was used to disrupt the uplink to the International Space Station. More recently, the Turla threat group hijacked a DVB-S satellite link in 2015, and last year Vesser Precision, an aerospace supplier, was hit by the DoppelPaymer ransomware.In addition, Beck referred to examples where satellite telemetry data was left on open databases, and the possibility that attackers could scrape keys or other credentials software developers working on space systems had left on GitHub.Security researchers such as Pavur have carried out work that shows other potential areas of exposure, such as the hacking of SATCOM terminals and GPS spoofing attacks.“Developers need to incorporate security into their design,” Pavur told The Daily Swig. “It’s a time of exciting change but the next three to four years will shape how the space technology sector develops.”Catch up on the latest critical infrastructure security newsSpace engineers have historically focused on building reliable satellites. With easier access to space and the surge in start-ups collecting critical data and delivering valuable services, space assets have become an attractive target for criminal hackers and nation-state spies.The organisers of Cysat estimate that, currently, 5,774 satellites are in orbit, with more than 1,000 new satellites due to launch annually in the next decade – faster than older satellites are taken out of commission.“Now is the time to build a European ecosystem able to respond to the current and future challenges of securing space assets, data, and services,” according to Cysat organizers.Cysat ’21 was organized by AP-Swiss, the Ambassador Platform of the European Space Agency’s Applications programme in Switzerland, and CYSEC, a local cybersecurity firm. The event took place from March 15-17 in a hybrid format – online and in Davos, Switzerland.The event attracted 200 participants and 50 speakers, made up from the sphere of politics (Viola Amherd, Elodie Viau), industry leaders (Airbus, IBM, Telesat, Microsoft, etc), national / European organizations (ESA, GSA, armasuisse, CNES, etc) and security experts / hackers.""The main themes were: understanding the cyber risks with the security experts and ethical hackers presentations,"" Mathieu Bailly, VP Space at Cysec, told The Daily Swig. ""Many explained in great details how existing infrastructures are not prepared, highlighting the need to infuse a security culture to the space industry: indeeed, there are many technical solutions that could be implemented in the short-term, the issue is rather about educating space engineers.""Bailly concluded: ""Newspace makes the situation is worse because of 'as a service' models (SataaS, GSaaS {Ground Segment as a service]), cloud-dependence, and smaller platforms with less room / budget /time for security.""This story has been updated to add comment from Mathieu Bailly, VP Space at Cysec, a Swiss cybersecurity company that co-founded and organized the Cysat conference",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/space-jam-researchers-and-satellite-start-ups-meet-to-discuss-celestial-cybersecurity,"['Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Telecommunications', 'Windows', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities']"
no,"MangaDex website taken offline following cyber-attack, data breach",Owners of manga fan site are rebuilding the codebase following series of security incidents,"A website that hosts free manga comics has been taken offline after malicious hackers allegedly gained access to a database that housed user data.The MangaDex site was taken down for maintenance last week (March 20) after an unknown actor gained access to an administrator account.The site’s maintainers said the attacker was able to access the account through “the reuse of a session token found in an old database leak through faulty configuration of session management”.After taking control of the account, they claim to have accessed user data.Although MangaDex said its investigations had “yet to confirm” that a data breach occurred, it said it was working on the assumption that it did take place.Planned shut downAfter gaining a foothold, the attacker contacted users via email claiming that MangaDex has a series of security flaws.Maintainers, who work on the site on a voluntary basis, patched two of three vulnerabilities but are still looking to identify the third vulnerability with the help of security researchers.A message posted on the website homepage reads:After the breach, we started spending many hours reviewing the code for possible further vulnerabilities, and started to patch what we could find to the best of our capabilities.This ran parallel to us opening the site after the breach, as we had incorrectly assumed that the attacker would not be able to gain further access.However, as a precaution, we had started rolling out monitoring of our infrastructure and had remained vigilant in the event the attacker returned.A message posted on the website homepage informing users of the security incidentPassword resetUsers have been warned that they should change their passwords in the event of a potential data breach stemming from this incident.The website will remain offline until security features have been updated, before a “barebones” version is made available.Read more of the latest database security newsMaintainers also said that they will be launching a bug bounty program for the site in the future.The Daily Swig has reached out to MangaDex for more information about its proposed security updates.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Mimecast confirms hackers behind SolarWinds supply chain attack accessed limited amount of customer information",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/mangadex-website-taken-offline-following-cyber-attack-data-breach,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Passwords', 'Authentication', 'Organizations']"
no,"GitHub awards bug bounty hunter $25,000 for Actions secrets theft report",The vulnerability was found in GitHub’s pull request mechanism,"A security vulnerability that allowed attackers to disclose Actions secrets in GitHub repositories has been patched, and the researcher who discovered the bug was awarded $25,000.On March 17, bug bounty hunter and Google employee Teddy Katz published a write-up of a GitHub vulnerability found in the communication system between repositories and the organizations’ workflow automation software, GitHub Actions.Tracked as CVE-2021-22862, the security flaw is described as an improper access control vulnerability that “allowed an authenticated user with the ability to fork a repository to disclose Actions secrets for the parent repository of the fork”.RELATED GitHub releases post-mortem on race condition vulnerability that forced global user sign-outKatz examined how GitHub manages pull requests. Each pull request is meant to have a base branch (base ref), and this is often the main branch of a repository.Pull request creators can set the base ref pointer. However, the bug bounty hunter realized that it was possible to set branches to commits, and while this resulted in errors due to merge conflicts, GitHub Actions’ permissions model turned the bug into something more serious.Stealing secretsIn GitHub Actions, pull requests – used to trigger an automatic response – are treated as special cases, but to stop pull request authors from accessing repository secrets, GitHub implements merge pull request simulations, and Actions workflows are based on the configuration of a pull request’s base branch.At least, unless you turn the base ref into a commit, first.According to Katz, this “breaks the GitHub Actions permission model” and bypasses Actions secrets restrictions.“Since the base branch is part of the base repository itself and not part of a fork, workflows triggered by pull_request_target are trusted and run with access to secrets,” the researcher explained.“We just created a pull request where the base branch is a commit hash, not a branch. And anyone can create a new commit hash in the base repository, since GitHub shares commits between forks.”An attacker could fork public repositories that use GitHub Actions, create a pull request, and then set a malicious Actions workflow and separately commit it to a fork – obtaining access to repository secrets in the process.Exploit caveatsThere are limitations to exploiting the vulnerability. An attacker needs to be able to create a fork in the target repository and GitHub Actions must have been used by the repository prior to an attack attempt.The vulnerability was first disclosed to GitHub’s security team via the HackerOne bug bounty platform on February 4, 2021. The issue was triaged and “partially patched” on the same day by preventing Actions builds from triggering a pull request with a base ref consisting of a 40-character commit hash.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/github-awards-bug-bounty-hunter-25-000-for-actions-secrets-theft-report,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Vulnerabilities', 'GitHub', 'Organizations', 'Edge', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'Encryption', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Malware', 'Hacking', 'Techniques']"
no,GE patches serious vulnerabilities in UR power management devices,Universal Relay devices are used to simplify power management in critical infrastructure assets,"General Electric (GE) has patched a number of potentially serious security vulnerabilities in its Universal Relay (UR) family of protection and control devices.Attackers who successfully exploit the flaws could “access sensitive information, reboot the UR, gain privileged access, or cause a denial-of-service condition”, according to a security advisory published by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) this week.Threat to critical assetsThe affected products, which are produced by GE’s Grid Solutions division, are used in critical infrastructure sectors worldwide like energy, manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation to simplify “power management for the protection of critical assets”.Although CISA described the flaws as being remotely exploitable by attackers with a “low skill level”, one of the security researchers who uncovered the vulnerabilities said exploitation “at scale” would “require a great level of skill, budget, and organization”.Speaking to The Daily Swig, Ron Brash, director of cybersecurity insights at Verve Industrial, also pointed out that “direct access to these systems or a network that can access them is required”.However, he added: “Generally these devices are not found on the internet directly unless someone has not applied any secure deployment strategies, or has inadvertently misconfigured various network infrastructure devices/security apparatuses.”Read more of the latest critical infrastructure security newsBut “if you can get access to these devices, and upload your own logic or firmware, then you can effectively brick them, upload malicious functionality, and the consequences will be highly negative.”However, a GE spokesperson told The Daily Swig that, “to date, GE has not been notified of any exploits of the reported vulnerabilities.”UR running insecure firmwareCISA describes the critical vulnerability (CVSS score 9.8) as arising from the “UR IED with ‘Basic’ security variant” not allowing “the disabling of the ‘Factory Mode’”.The issue (CVE-2021-27426) is classified as insecure default variable initialization, meaning an internal variable is initialized with an insecure value by default, potentially exposing sensitive data or system information to modification.Assigned the second highest CVSS of 8.4, another, high risk flaw (CVE-2021-27430) related to unused hardcoded credentials in the bootloader binary.Ron Brash, who discovered the vulnerability, said: “The credentials were visible in the firmware in cleartext. It also leaked the version, other available functionality, and if fuzzed, it could be interrupted or be made to behave unreliably.”Another high severity flaw (tracked as CVE-2021-27428 and with a CVSS score of 7.5), also uncovered by Brash, means an unauthorized user could upgrade firmware without appropriate privileges.“Physical access or access to the device via a network helps, but we were able to push a tampered image to the device,” said Brash.The other two high risk bugs related to inadequate SSH encryption and potential sensitive information exposure through running a web interface over HTTP.A further four flaws were deemed medium risk.Firmware fix, mitigationsAffected UR models include: B30, B90, C30, C60, C70, C95, D30, D60, F35, F60, G30, G60, L30, L60, L90, M60, N60, T35, and T60.Brash said Verve Industrial submitted details of the flaws to GE in July 2020. UR firmware version 8.10, which addressed all of the flaws, landed on December 24 2020.Catch up on the latest hardware security newsA GE spokesperson said that the company “immediately worked to assess any potential impact and remediate the reported vulnerabilities” upon receiving the reports.“We encourage our customers to visit the Grid Solutions customer portal and/or the CISA advisory for additional information and mitigation recommendations,” the vendor added.SCADA-X, VuMetric, and the US Department of Energy’s CyTRICS program were also involved in finding, analyzing, and reporting the vulnerabilities.Salutary reminder“The advisory is a reminder that the latest programming fads such as sprints, to use open source everywhere, or by abstracting needlessly away from hardware will not absolve humankind from logic, requirements, and flaws that sneak by the narrow scope of most companies’ testing,” said Brash. “As devices and software continue to advance, new layers of functionality and integrations will be added”, and inevitable security degradation over time across “multiple components will equate to multiple high-risk entry points for a malicious party.”Moreover, “a lack of signed firmware will allow malicious parties to insert their own code onto your device – especially if it’s not verified by the receiver.”Brash envisages that vendors might “start completely encrypting images” to validate a device’s integrity, although this will create “key management complexities” and “hinder “derived SBoM creation”.RECOMMENDED Measuring risk: Organizations urged to choose defense-in-depth over CVE whack-a-mole",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ge-patches-serious-vulnerabilities-in-ur-power-management-devices,"['Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Hardware', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'IoT', 'Encryption', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Organizations', 'Healthcare', 'Government', 'Research']"
no,GitHub releases post-mortem on race condition vulnerability that forced global user sign-out,Issue resulted in some users gaining access to other users’ sessions,"GitHub has released further details of a rare security vulnerability that potentially allowed users to log into other user sessions.Last week, as reported by The Daily Swig, GitHub users were forcibly logged out of their accounts to protect against what the open source platform called a “potentially serious” race condition security bug.In a blog post yesterday (March 18), GitHub’s Dirkjan Bussink gave a post-mortem analysis of what caused the bug and how it was fixed.The issue was first discovered on March 2, Bussink wrote, after a GitHub user reported that they had logged in to their account, but then had been authenticated as another user. A second report from another user followed.“After reviewing request and audit logs, we could validate the external reports received – a user’s session was indeed seen being suddenly shared across two IP addresses around the time of the reports,” wrote Bussink.An investigation determined that this race condition vulnerability was caused by a thread handling issue.Thread handling issuesGitHub browser interactions are mainly handled by a Ruby on Rails application that’s known to have components that were not written to run in multiple threads, Bussink explained.The new background thread produced a “novel and unforeseen interaction” with GitHub’s exception handling routines, meaning that when exceptions were reported from a background thread – such as a query timeout – the error log would contain information from both the background thread and the currently running request, “showing that the data was being pulled across threads”.GitHub initially believed this would only be a problem internally, however it was later determined that it was also affecting user sessions.BACKGROUND GitHub users forcibly logged out of accounts to patch ‘potentially serious’ security bugThe blog post reads: “Unicorn, the underlying Rack HTTP server used in our Rails application, does not create a new and separate env object for each request.“It instead allocates one single Ruby Hash that is then cleared (using Hash#clear) between each request that it handles.“This led to the realization that the thread safety issue in our exception logging could result in not only inconsistent data being logged in these exceptions, but the sharing of request data on GitHub.com.”Read more of the latest news about security vulnerabilitiesIf an exception occurred at “just the right time” and if concurrent request processing happened in “just the right sequence” across multiple requests, the session in one response was replaced with a session from an earlier response.“Returning the incorrect cookie only happened for the session cookie header and as we noticed before, the rest of the response body, such as the HTML, was all still based on the user who was previously authenticated,” wrote Bussink.The bug needed very specific conditions to work – it required a background thread, shared exception context between the main thread and the background thread, callbacks in the exception context, reusing the env object between requests, and GitHub’s particular authentication system.More information on the vulnerability and a technical analysis can be found in Bussink’s blog post.Clean upGitHub was able to fix the issue and identify all user sessions that were affected.As a precaution, all user sessions on GitHub were revoked, despite the fact that the rare bug had a “very small chance of occurring”.Bussink wrote: “This was not a risk we were willing to take, given the potential impact of even one of these incorrectly returned sessions being used.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Chained vulnerabilities used to take control of MyBB forums",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/github-releases-post-mortem-on-race-condition-vulnerability-that-forced-global-user-sign-out,"['GitHub', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Authentication', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Analysis']"
no,Chained vulnerabilities used to take control of MyBB forums,Esoteric hacking risk addressed through recent update,"Security researchers have managed to chain together a pair of vulnerabilities that might, with difficulty, have created a way to take over boards running the popular MyBB forum software.The flaws – discovered by independent researchers Simon Scannell and Carl Smith – were resolved through a software update from MyBB that was issued last week.This cleared the way for publication of details of the nested auto URL persistent XSS and theme properties SQL injection vulnerabilities on Thursday.In a guest post on the Sonarsource blog, Scannell and Smith explain how MyBB forums running versions between and including 1.8.16 and 1.8.25 are affected by two vulnerabilities that could be chained to achieve remote code execution (RCE).Catch up on the latest security vulnerability newsTakeovers of vulnerable systems would be possible even in the absence of prior takeover of privileged accounts on targeted MyBB installations.The first vulnerability (nested auto URL persistent XSS – CVE-2021-27889) involves security shortcomings in the MyBB rendering process that “enabled any unprivileged forum user of a MyBB board to embed stored XSS payloads into threads, posts and even private messages”, explain the researchers.The second vulnerability (theme properties SQL injection – CVE-2021-27890) involves an SQL injection vulnerability that could yield RCE.Booby-trapped messageScannell and Smith also discovered a mechanism for combining the bug pair to maximum effect. Exploiting the flaws is tricky but possible providing a targeted MyBB administrator can be duped into opening a booby-trapped message, as the two researchers explain.A sophisticated attacker could develop an exploit for the stored XSS vulnerability and then send a private message to a targeted administrator of a MyBB board.As soon as the administrator opens the private message, on his own trusted forum, the exploit triggers. An RCE vulnerability is automatically exploited in the background and leads to a full takeover of the targeted MyBB forum.The issues were disclosed to MyBB on February 22. In response, MyBB developed patches for its software, released on March 10.Protective measuresWritten in PHP, MyBB is popular open source software that’s thought to power more than 10,000 forum sites.Last week’s updates also address four lower severity flaws, discovered internally by MyBB.A representative of the MyBB development team said that it welcomed the chance to work with security researchers before going on to offer their take on the particular issues uncovered by Scannell and Smith:The patched exploitation chain takes advantage of the weakness areas related to legacy code we identified last year.We look forward to replacing them in the future, and in the meantime, are reviewing additional defense-in-depth checks addressing these classes of vulnerabilities.?As is often the case, forum administrators can defend themselves and their boards against security issues like the ones described by following common recommendations that range from logging out of the admin control panel as soon as possible, to making the ACP URL secret.Scannell and Smith uncovered the vulnerabilities after analyzing forum software used to create a capture the flag (CTF) challenge they participated in.The Daily Swig asked the researchers, via Sonarsource, what wider lessons might be drawn from their research.

no,Cypriot hacker who extorted website owners by threatening to leak stolen data is jailed,US sentence and a heavy fine for criminal hacker who targeted multiple organizations,"A Cypriot man has been jailed in the US over a scam that involved extorting website operators with stolen personal information.Joshua Polloso Epifaniou, 22, of Nicosia, threatened to release stolen user information unless the websites paid a ransom as part of a scam that ran between October 2014 and November 2016.Epifaniou pleaded guilty to computer fraud conspiracy and computer hacking in January. Before entering a guilty plea, Epifaniou paid nearly $600,000 in restitution to the victims.At a sentencing hearing this week, Epifaniou was jailed for one year and one day, in addition to the three years and 10 months he’s already served in custody for the offense prior to his sentencing hearing.US District Judge Mark Cohen further imposed a combined forfeiture order of $472,000.Data leak threatEpifaniou, a teenager living with his mother in Cyprus at the time of his offences, selected potential victims based on website traffic rankings, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a news release yesterday (March 17).He then worked with his shady associates to find and exploit website or network vulnerabilities in order to steal personally identifiable information (PII) from user and customer databases at targeted organizations.After obtaining the PII, Epifaniou used proxy servers in foreign countries to send extortion demands, threatening to leak sensitive data unless the victim transferred funds in cryptocurrency wallets controlled by the gang.Epifaniou operated under aliases including ‘Charley Sullivan’ and ‘Richard Charley’.According to the original indictment (PDF), victims included Bleacher Report, an online sports news website; Armor Games, an online gaming platform; Adafruit, a New York-based electronic hardware company; Snagajob, an employment search website; and Ripoff Report, a US consumer report website.Read more of the latest cybersecurity news from the USSQL injection was one of the main vectors of these attacks, according to the indictment, which adds that Epifaniou extorted $19,000 in bitcoin from Turner Broadcasting Corporation and $1,650 in bitcoin from Armor Games, respectively.The much higher restitution payment Epifaniou has been obliged to pay is a reflection of the huge surge in value of bitcoin over recent years.According to the DoJ statement, Epifaniou was also operating a lucrative side hustle that involved using his illicit access to Ripoff Report in order to “remove online complaints posted on the website at the request of paying clients”.“Epifaniou and his co-conspirator, Pierre Zarokian [plea deal, PDF], charged clients between $1,000 and $5,000 for removal of each complaint and falsely told clients that the removals were court-ordered,” according to the DoJ.The case was investigated by the FBI and assisted by the Office for Combating Cybercrime of the Cyprus Police.

no,Penetration testing of enterprise systems more prevalent than ever due to remote working during Covid-19 pandemic,Cybersecurity staff are being asked to conduct more pen tests – but this still might not be enough,"The rapid shift to a work-from-home model caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has ramped up penetration testing in enterprise environments, but questions remain over whether or not current test rates go far enough.The second annual Penetration Testing survey, published on Thursday by HelpSystems’ Core Security, includes insight provided by 300 cybersecurity professionals to better understand the current role penetration tester teams play in securing enterprise systems.Penetration testing may be conducted for reasons including vulnerability management, security posture and hygiene checks, risk analysis, and for compliance purposes.“While it may seem like a large, expensive undertaking, penetration testing can be done on any scale or budget,” the survey notes. “For example, pen tests don’t have to cover the entire infrastructure, but can instead be strategically scoped to focus on the most critical systems.Read more of the latest news about coronavirus and cybersecurityThe majority of respondents surveyed – 39% – still only conduct pen tests once or twice a year. A further 16% said tests were conducted on a quarterly basis, and 11%, 9%, and 10% of respondents perform a pen test of some form on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis, respectively.However, due to Covid-19 and the increased attack surface caused by a rapid transition to work from home setups, more emphasis is now beginning to be placed on pen tests – and network security in particular is on the radar.According to the study, 45% of respondents are placing a greater emphasis on network security tests due to the current state of work. In addition, organizations are asking cybersecurity teams to expand the scope of their penetration tests in 38% of cases.Cybersecurity teams are also being asked to examine web applications more frequently, according to 36% of those surveyed, and both social engineering and phishing attack vectors are being taken more seriously, claimed 31% of respondents.Barriers to robust penetration testing programs, however, remain. Survey respondents said that executive acceptance, finding enough skilled staff, and ensuring others actually act on the cybersecurity and risk data a test reveals are persistent, ongoing challenges.BACKGROUND The age of Covid-19: Lockdowns and cybersecurity, 12 months onThe report found that 71% of organizations deemed penetration testing to be “important” but only 44% of cybersecurity staff surveyed were “confident” in their company’s security posture.According to those surveyed, 80% are most concerned about misconfigurations – which could include insecure servers or access control problems – followed by phishing, lax passwords, and orphaned accounts.In total, 15% of respondents still say they never conduct penetration testing. A lack of executive sponsorship was cited by 49%, 44% said staff shortages were to blame, and 44% said low organizational maturity were reasons for this security failure.Core Security noted that penetration testing can not only provide short-term value by unmasking serious security issues, but can also bolster long-term cybersecurity programs, if frequent tests are permitting, to act as a “guide” for overall strategies.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE UK cybersecurity spending on the rise despite pandemic-induced budget cuts",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/penetration-testing-of-enterprise-systems-more-prevalent-than-ever-due-to-remote-working-during-covid-19-pandemic,"['Coronavirus', 'Network', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Phishing', 'Passwords', 'Organizations', 'Research']"
no,Microsoft blames crypto key rotation snafu for 365 outage,"Teams, Exchange Online, and other services were knocked offline for more than 14 hours","Microsoft has blamed a key rotation issue for a large-scale 365 outage that affected many of its services on Monday and Tuesday.The outage – which took down Teams, Exchange Online, and other 365 services – kicked in at around 19:00 UTC on Monday and was only resolved more than 14 hours later, at around 09:25 on Tuesday.Problems in the periodic rotation of cryptographic keys caused authentication checks to fail for any application that relied on Azure Active Directory, causing problems that persisted overnight until engineers were able to apply a fix.In a status update, Microsoft explained that the authentication problems arose because a key marked for retention had erroneously been deleted by the system. This caused particular problems because the key was needed to manage a migration project, as the company explained:The preliminary analysis of this incident shows that an error occurred in the rotation of keys used to support Azure AD’s use of OpenID and other identity standard protocols for cryptographic signing operations. As part of standard security hygiene, an automated system on a time-based schedule removes keys that are no longer in use.Over the last few weeks, a particular key was marked as “retain” for longer than normal to support a complex cross-cloud migration. This exposed a bug where the automation incorrectly ignored that “retain” state, leading it to remove that particular key.Azure Admin Portal, Teams, Exchange, Azure KeyVault, SharePoint, and Storage were all effected to a lesser or greater extent by the problem.Growing painsSecurity vendor Venafi warned that outages of this nature are likely to become more common as digital transformation accelerates, thus heightening the importance of key rotation.Michael Thelander, director of machine identity strategy at Venafi, commented: “Poorly orchestrated key rotation is the Achilles heel of modern digital transformation efforts; this oversight is capable of bringing down entire applications and services in an instant.“Keys and certificates have numerous ‘states’ that guide their automation and orchestration processes. They also have hard-coded expirations.“‘Retain’ is a tag that tells the system, ‘This key may be retired or expired, but the system needs to keep it to enable any overlap between dynamic processes’.“If the ‘retain’ tag is overlooked and the keys are deleted before replacements are ready – and this all happens in microseconds – systems fail,” he added.Thelander concluded: “Unfortunately, these kinds of outages will only continue until organizations adopt an enterprise-wide approach to managing the machine identities these keys and certificates represent.“Digital transformation is not going to slow down, and this requires automation of keys and certificates found in workloads, containers, and across cloud environments as well as those in on-prem environments.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE SAP addresses critical double trouble as Microsoft patches obsolete Internet Explorer",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/microsoft-blames-crypto-key-rotation-snafu-for-365-outage,"['Cloud', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'Microsoft', 'Encryption', 'Industry', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development']"
no,Mimecast confirms hackers behind SolarWinds supply chain attack accessed limited amount of customer information,Third-party report finds ‘no evidence’ that security firm’s source code was modified,"Email security firm Mimecast has confirmed that a network intrusion earlier this year was conducted by the same “sophisticated” threat group that was behind the SolarWinds supply chain attack.Mimecast’s networks were compromised in January after malicious actors gained access to its production grid environment.A report released yesterday (March 16), produced by a third-party forensics team at Mandiant, has determined that the attack was conducted by the same actors who were responsible for the high-profile SolarWinds hack.Deep diveIn a port-mortem of the attack, assailants believed to be from Russian hacking group APT29 were said to have exploited a backdoor in SolarWinds’ Orion software to gain access to the Mimecast production grid environment.Following this, the threat actor then “accessed certain Mimecast-issued certificates and related customer server connection information”, the report details.It reads: “The threat actor also accessed a subset of email addresses and other contact information, as well as encrypted and/or hashed and salted credentials.Read more of the latest news about cyber-attacks“In addition, the threat actor accessed and downloaded a limited number of our source code repositories, but we found no evidence of any modifications to our source code nor do we believe there was any impact on our products.”Mimecast said there is “no evidence” that the threat actor accessed email or archive content held on behalf of our customers.‘Single digit’ victimsMimecast said it was first notified of the incident by Microsoft, later employing Mandiant, a division of FireEye, to conduct a third-party investigation.The report details the various phases of the analysis, as well as the steps taken by Mimecast to secure user data.INSIGHT Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowMimecast said that a “low single digit” number of customers were impacted by the attack, as reported at the time of discovery.The vendor advised all users to reset any server credentials in use on the Mimecast platform as a precaution.Supply chain attackIn January, the SolarWinds supply chain attack saw threat actors exploit a backdoor vulnerability in the company’s Orion software, used for IT management and monitoring, to gain access to customers’ networks.A number of high-profile organizations such as Microsoft and FireEye were impacted by the incident, as well as numerous US government agencies.In February, security researchers at Trustwave discovered three new severe vulnerabilities in SolarWinds, with the most critical bug opening the door to remote code execution.All three vulnerabilities were patched before public disclosure.

no,"Spectre attacks against websites still a serious threat, Google warns",Browser-maker urges web developers to take action against vulnerability that continues to haunt the industry,"UPDATED Three years after the infamous Spectre vulnerability was discovered, hackers can still exploit the security flaw in order to force web browsers to leak information, Google’s security team warns.The problem has arisen despite extensive efforts by browser developers to harden their software against Spectre-style attacks.The results of the research was published on the Google Security Blog on Friday (March 12) and include a proof-of-concept exploit written in JavaScript that still works against several browsers, operating systems, and processors.The key lesson from the research is that Spectre still haunts the industry – so developers need to deploy application-level mitigation measures in order to guard against potential attacks.The Spectre vulnerabilityFirst reported in 2018, the Spectre vulnerability and its twin, Meltdown, both take advantage of flaws in the optimization features of modern CPUs in order to circumvent the security mechanisms that prevent different processes from accessing each other’s memory space.The Spectre vulnerability allowed a wide range of attacks against different types of applications, including web apps. Hackers can potentially exploit the flaws to extract sensitive information across different websites in a browser by exploiting how different applications and processes interact with processors and on-chip memory.INSIGHT Meltdown and Spectre, one year on: Feared CPU slowdown never really materializedWhile newer CPUs have partially mitigated the Spectre vulnerability at the hardware level, there’s still a need for software-based mitigations in order to further limit the scope of potential attacks.Along with cloud providers and operating system vendors, the developers of web browsers have been putting in efforts to protect users against Spectre attacks.Their measures include browser protection options such as site isolation and out-of-process iframes, alongside security features that web developers can use to control the origin of resources used in websites.“These mechanisms, while crucially important, don't prevent the exploitation of Spectre; rather, they protect sensitive data from being present in parts of the memory from which they can be read by the attacker,” the Google Security Team explains.Hacking the browserThe proof-of-concept (PoC) developed by the Google Security Team exploits the JavaScript engine on Chrome, but the researchers said the same issue applies to other browsers as well.The PoC is based on a gadget that exploits the “variant 1” Spectre vulnerability across a side-channel that observes the side-effect of the attack.Variant 1 Spectre, also known as the “bounds check bypass attack”, manipulates the speculative execution mechanisms of processors to access out-of-bounds memory locations.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsSide-channels that steal secret data from speculative execution attacks such as Spectre use timing attack techniques to determine the location of the target data. Modern browsers reduce the granularity of their time-measurement functions to prevent such attacks.The Google Security Team developed a new technique that overcomes this limitation and leaks data with low-precision timers.The researchers published a demo of their PoC online:“While we don’t believe this particular PoC can be re-used for nefarious purposes without significant modifications, it serves as a compelling demonstration of the risks of Spectre,” the researchers conclude.“In particular, we hope it provides a clear signal for web application developers that they need to consider this risk in their security evaluations and take active steps to protect their sites.”Web developers urged to actShort of hardware changes and firmware updates, there’s no easy way to develop a comprehensive fix for speculation execution vulnerabilities such as Spectre, the Google Security Team warns.“Web developers should consider more robustly isolating their sites by using new security mechanisms that actively deny attackers access to cross-origin resources,” the blog post states.Last year, Google Security published a comprehensive guide on mitigation techniques for different Spectre-style hardware attacks and common web-level cross-site leaks.But the suggested methods require developers to assess the threat these vulnerabilities pose to their applications and understand how to deploy them, the Security Team notes.The task is far from straightforward.To further assist web developers, the Chrome security team has published a lengthy guide on hardening web applications against Spectre attacks.The guidelines focus on controlling and limiting cross-origin resource sharing and interactions between websites.The Google Security Team warns that, even if applied rigorously, the mitigation techniques don’t guarantee complete protection against Spectre“They [the mitigations] require a considered deployment approach which takes behaviors specific to the given application into account,” the researchers advise.This story was updated to clarify that not even the latest CPUs offer complete protection against Spectre",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/spectre-attacks-against-websites-still-a-serious-threat-google-warns,"['Google', 'Browsers', 'Vulnerabilities', 'JavaScript', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hardware', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Side-channel']"
no,UK defense and foreign policy review places ‘cyber’ front and center,Prime Minister says the new National Cyber Force will have its headquarters in the north of England,"The digital realm is set to play a far greater role in the UK’s defense, foreign, and security policies, according to a new government strategy.The UK’s latest review of defense and foreign policy states that the country will aim to become a “responsible, democratic cyber power”.‘Cyber’, according to the document, is now an emerging military domain, along with space.

no,"The age of Covid-19: Lockdowns and cybersecurity, 12 months on",Infosec ‘slow-pocalypse’ sees surge in ransomware and online fraud,"ANALYSIS Working practices have changed beyond recognition in the year since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a Covid-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020.Lockdowns (or ‘stay at home’ orders) that followed in the UK on March 23 and elsewhere around the same time were accompanied by a shift towards working from home that has kept organizations operating during the pandemic.What started out as a temporary measure has become the ‘new normal’.A huge upheaval in working practices has been accompanied by heightened risk and a shift in cybercrime tactics, bringing phishing and ransomware much to the fore and putting remote access systems on the front line.Secondary dependenciesAkamai observed a 30% increase in internet traffic as the pandemic lockdowns triggered a global shift to remote functionality, which continues today.There’s been a sudden and unexpected dependence on technologies that were secondary before, such as video conferencing.Virtual private network (VPN) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) administration tools have become indispensable assets to support a remote workforce.RELATED Coronavirus: How to work from home securely during a period of isolationUnfortunately, these tools can also be rife with vulnerabilities such as unpatched software or weak login credentials.Attackers are increasingly targeting these systems, often in the early stage of ransomware attacks, prompting warnings from many in the infosec industry and an advisory (PDF) from the US government’s Central Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and FBI.The UK went into coronavirus lockdown on March 23, 2020Uneven pictureWhile there’s broad consensus that small businesses have been hammered by cyber-attacks during the coronavirus pandemic, security experts quizzed by The Daily Swig gave contrasting opinions on how larger enterprises have fared over the last 12 months.Fabian Libeau, EMEA vice president at RiskIQ, told The Daily Swig: “We saw and continue to see bad actors executing layered attack campaigns, first with phishing and social engineering to infect users with malware, then taking over the entire system with ransomware or other forms of malware.“Large corporations – which rely on markets and supply chains originating in hard hit coronavirus-affected regions – have been especially vulnerable to these tactics,” he added.Read more of the latest UK cybersecurity newsHowever, and by contrast, according to Orange Cyberdefense, the pandemic has had relatively little direct impact on enterprise security risks. There was no surge of incidents logged by the managed security services supplier as lockdowns came into effect.In fact, during the early stage of the pandemic, confirmed incidents in Sweden (which was not in lockdown) exceeded those in France (in lockdown).Anecdotal evidence from various sources suggests that that cyber-attacks have been unevenly spread across the economy, with a large number of hard-hit smaller businesses left struggling to cope.Vicious cycleLisa Ventura, CEO and founder of industry trade group UK Cyber Security Association, said that surveys showed that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) had been blitzed with a variety of attacks during the pandemic.These attacks ranged from phishing to ransomware and other forms of malware, manipulator-in-the-middle attacks, and CEO fraud.RELATED UK cybersecurity spending on the rise despite pandemic-induced budget cutsRapid changes left gaps in IT systems that were exploited by criminals, particularly through ransomware attacks.“In many cases… SMEs just simply preferred to pay the ransom instead of dealing with encrypted files and recovering their IT systems,” according to Ventura.“This, in turn, created a vicious cycle. The more that these attacks succeeded, the more they occurred – particularly in SME businesses.”Cybercriminals were quick to capitalize on the Covid-19 pandemicGame’s the same, just got more fierceThe volume of new malware samples in 2020 was almost double those detected in 2019, according to Skybox Security.New ransomware samples increased by 106% year-over-year, and all trojan types experienced 128% growth.“Whilst the topic of Covid-19 continues to be exploited, the nature of attacks remains fairly consistent,” according to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.“Fraudsters are not changing their techniques, tactics or procedures, but they are cashing in and have recognised how important this is, as a global event, and how they can exploit it.”TakedownThe pandemic has been accompanied by a rise of Covid-themed attacks and fraudulent or malicious web domains featuring coronavirus keywords and fake promises of mail-order vaccines.The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency, has played a leading role in the takedown of scam sites, which have surged during the pandemic.Although the organization’s Suspicious Email Reporting Service (SERS) plays an important role, most of the NCSC’s work in getting malicious URLs removed from the internet is done through its takedown service, one element of its wider ‘Active Cyber Defence’ program.SPECIAL FEATURE Declassified: GCHQ celebrates 100 years of secrets well keptThe takedown service proactively finds malicious content hosted on the internet and seeks to have it removed.From March 2020 to the end of August 2020, the NCSC took down 15,354 campaigns which used coronavirus themes in the “lure”. A total of 251 of these were phishing campaigns.In the year between September 2019 and August 2020, the NCSC dealt with 732 ‘cyber incidents’. Around a quarter of the incidents the NCSC responded to were related to coronavirus.The entire vaccine supply chain is under repeated attack. One incident NCSC reportedly dealt with included an attack on the Oxford-AstraZeneca blamed in media reports on North Korean state-sponsored hackers.Emerging from lockdownIn the face of everything that’s happened over the past 12 months, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed, but some help is at hand.For example, in response to the pandemic the UK’s NCSC has produced a raft of cybersecurity guidance to organizations, including:Home working guidance to help firms in either introducing or scaling up remote working. The guidelines include advice on using VPN technologiesAdvice for smaller organizations moving their physical operations onlineVideo conferencing configuration and deployment guidanceTop tips for staff using personal IT while home workingMore generally, the NCSC’s Cyber Action Plan, launched in February as part of its broader Cyber Aware campaign, is geared towards helping small businesses prioritize cybersecurity measures.RECOMMENDED More than half of women in infosec are treated unequally to male colleagues due to ‘blatant sexism’ in the workplace – report",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/the-age-of-covid-19-lockdowns-and-cybersecurity-12-months-on,"['Coronavirus', 'UK', 'Cybercrime', 'VPN', 'Analysis', 'Akamai', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Ransomware', 'Malware', 'Phishing', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Europe', 'Interviews', 'Organizations', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Asia', 'Oceania', 'Latin', 'America', 'Africa', 'Middle', 'East', 'Enterprise', 'Hardware', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Fraud']"
yes,Pwning the pen tester: Malicious Wireshark packet capture file risk revealed,CVE assigned due to potential for harm even though some social engineering trickery is required,"Maliciously constructed Wireshark packet capture files might be used to distribute malware, providing recipients can be tricked into double clicking file URL fields.Variants of the same attack could potentially be thrown against users of the popular network security tool, widely used by security analysts and penetration testers, whether they use Windows or Xubuntu Linux-based systems.The attack, discovered by security researcher Lukas Euler of Positive Security, is explained in a recent post on GitLab that features proof-of-concept videos.Even though developers of Wireshark normally avoid asking for a CVE to be created for potential security issues that require user interaction, an exception was made in this case because of the “low barrier to entry and level of control” an attacker might gain.The issue, tracked as CVE-2021-22191, was resolved through a recent update.17-year-old bugA discussion on source code management platform GitLab suggests the issue may have been introduced with changes to Wireshark made as long as 17 years ago.The root cause of the problem is that for some schemes, referenced files will be opened by the system’s standard application associated with a particular file type, as Euler explains in his blog post:Some fields in the Wireshark proto_tree are double-clickable and pass URLs with arbitrary schemes to the QDesktopServices::openUrl function. http and https URLs passed to this function are opened by the browser which is generally safe.For some other schemes like dav and file however, referenced files will be opened by the system’s standard application associated with their file type.By preparing internet-hosted file shares and executable files, arbitrary code execution can be achieved via malicious pcap(ng) files or captured live-traffic and some user interaction.On Windows machines, if a user opens the malicious pcap file and double-clicks the file URL, the WebDAV share is mounted in the background and the .jar file is executed.A similar attack with the same effect might be run against Wireshark users on Xubuntu but featuring NFS share and a malicious .desktop file.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsEuler warned: “An attacker could distribute malicious capture files and entice people to inspect them. On Windows with JRE installed, a simple double click on a crafted field is enough to cause code execution on the victim's system.”In a security advisory, Wireshark advises users to update to versions 3.4.4 or 3.2.12, both of which have been patched to address the issue.""The issue on GitLab also links the relevant merge requests,"" Euler told The Daily Swig. ""The code difference shows that the team opted to fix the issue by copying potentially malicious URLs to the clipboard rather than [by] opening them directly.""High barrier to exploitationEuler added that, contrary to Wireshark's advisory, older versions of the utility before the officially supported versions 3.4.x and 3.2.x, are also vulnerable.In all cases the risk is low.""Exploiting the Wireshark vulnerability requires an attacker to make their victim capture malicious traffic/open a malicious capture file, and then double click the malicious entry in the packet dissector view,"" Euler explained. ""While it is not impossible to achieve this, it seems like an unlikely choice for larger malware campaigns.""Even though the flaw has existed for years there's nothing to suggest exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild. This isn't altogether surprising since the same methodology of distributing malicious URLs can be more readily be thrown as users of similarly vulnerable, more widely used applications.Euler and his colleague Fabian Bräunlein, also from Positive Security, discovered the vulnerability in Wireshark while researching the URL opening behaviour of popular desktop applications.This work uncovered code execution vulnerabilities and other flaws due to be detailed by the pair in an upcoming blog post, due to be published over the coming weeks.Wireshark is developed by San Francisco-based Riverbed Technology, a developer of network performance products.The Daily Swig has approached Riverbed for comment.

no,LocalStack zero-day vulnerabilities chained to achieve remote takeover of local instances,Project maintainers reportedly declined to fix flaws due to limited attack scenarios,"Critical vulnerabilities in LocalStack, a popular framework for building cloud applications, can be chained to remotely take over locally-run LocalStack instances, security researchers claim.Researchers from Sonarsource have documented how they combined cross-site scripting (XSS) and server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities to achieve OS command injection against the open source Python application.However, the vulnerabilities remain unpatched in subsequently released LocalStack versions – v0.12.6 and v0.12.7 – after the project maintainers determined that real-world attack scenarios were “limited”, Sonarsource researcher Dennis Brinkrolf said in a blog post published on March 2.Attacking the StackResearchers observed that LocalStack lacked authentication, probably because the software is “run locally or in a Docker environment, as recommended by the vendor” and therefore not directly exposed to the internet, suggested Brinkrolf.“However, it is a common fallacy that this type of application cannot be attacked” by external actors, he added, citing how so-called ‘drive-by pharming attacks’ have previously compromised network routers via their web interface.Read more of the latest cloud security newsCiting a Sonarsource video demonstrating the LocalStack attack, Johannes Dahse, head of R&D at the Swiss infosec firm, told The Daily Swig: “All it takes is to host a malicious website, for example with interesting content related to LocalStack.“If an attacker is motivated to target a LocalStack developer, we think that she/he will likely succeed.”LocalStack’s project maintainers have yet to respond to questions emailed to them by The Daily Swig, but we will update the article should we receive a response.CORS for concernLocalStack is used to set up AWS cloud environments within local networks in order to develop and test cloud and serverless apps.The researchers found that remote attackers could interact with locally-running LocalStack instances through the victim’s browser, which they might use to read documentation, suggested Brinkrolf.“When this victim visits (or is lured to) a malicious/infected website controlled by an attacker, it is possible to trigger cross-site HTTP requests to the victim’s local network via JavaScript code.”Although this means “an attacker can send arbitrary requests from a website to a LocalStack instance”, the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) mechanism deployed by popular browsers blocks it from reading the responses, said the researcher.Catch up on the latest security vulnerability newsHowever, sending the attack payload blindly can still be “sufficient to carry out a successful attack via” cross-site request forgery (CSRF) techniques.“Moreover, LocalStack explicitly allows the execution of cross-origin requests through any page by setting special HTTP headers in the response,” continued Brinkrolf.“This means that the attacker can detect and attack a LocalStack instance through the XHR response and does not actually operate blindly.”Although leading browsers have recently tightened CORS restrictions “to reduce the potential of CSRF attacks”, these were bypassed by an XSS vulnerability uncovered by the researchers.MitM backdoorThe CSRF payload can also reconfigure the edge router that relays requests to LocalStack APIs and add a proxy “that points to an attacker-controlled IP as proxy host”, leading to a persistent SSRF vulnerability.Because “the server copies the entire HTTP request from the client and forwards it to the server”, the client’s HTTP headers – including the AWS Cloud authorization header – are then “sent to the attacker-controlled server”, paving the way to “session hijacking and stealing sensitive data from the test cloud”.And since the SSRF request’s HTTP response “is printed unsanitized in LocalStack”, an XSS payload from the attacker’s server leads to a persistent manipulator-in-the-middle (MitM) proxy that “enables abuse of further features” and the potential “to trigger other code vulnerabilities” – including the command injection vulnerability outlined in Brinkrolf’s blog post.The researchers say they also uncovered a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) bug in the platform.Real-world threat?Brinkrolf said Sonarsource first notified LocalStack maintainers of the vulnerabilities in October 2020 and contacted them on a further two occasions, before a response arrived in January indicating that the maintainers saw the application’s local execution as a significant barrier to exploitation.“While we agree that real-world attacks against local instances are less likely than against directly exposed applications, we believe that developers should be aware of these risks in order to protect their setups,” said Brinkrolf.Johannes Dahse added: “In order to keep the attack surface as small as possible we believe all code vulnerabilities should be addressed.”DON’T FORGET TO

no,"Shorteners – new tool allows researchers, orgs to search for exposed shortened URLs",Users can search or browse any links that have been shortened from a specific domain,"A new online service allows security researchers to search for exposed shortened URLs, known for their risks to security and privacy.Shortened URLs are comparatively easy to brute-force, thanks to the lower character count, which reduces the number of possibilities, and often involve sensitive documents.Using Grayhat Warfare’s new service, users can search using keywords, filter by extensions, or browse any links that have been shortened from a specific domain.“We use the raw data gathered from URLTeam, and we try to clean them up, remove invalid entries, expired domains and unsecure URLs, and create a database organized in such a way that you can instantly get results on your filters,” a Grayhat spokesperson told The Daily Swig.Read more of the latest hacking tools newsIf this sounds familiar, it’s because of urlhunter, developed by security analyst Utku Sen and released late last year.“Urlhunter is an excellent tool if you want to run something on your PC and not rely on an external service. It’s an open source tool for hackers and a pretty good one at that. But using it is a bit harder and the user needs more resources,” said the spokesperson.Shorteners makes it easy to search for exposed shortened URLs that may leak sensitive information“You need to download it, find the specific file on the URLTeam’s releases, and give the correct parameter to download it. Then you have to wait for the download to finish, which is a rather slow process, because Archive.org is limiting the bandwidth.”The Grayhat team pinged each one of the one billion-odd files and removed all inactive 404 links, as well as other bad links.

We have very good initial results on that front,” says the spokesperson.“Also, we are always toying with the idea of making a search engine for open directories, since it’s so close to what we already did, and adding more cloud services – currently we have Amazon S3 and Azure containers – like Digital Ocean and Google Buckets.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Regexploit tool unveiled with a raft of ReDoS bugs already on its resume",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/shorteners-new-tool-allows-researchers-orgs-to-search-for-exposed-shortened-urls,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Privacy', 'Machine', 'Learning', 'AI', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise']"
no,US Congresswoman proposes national data privacy law,Bill would enact a unified federal law governing the use of citizens’ personal information,"UPDATED Washington DC congresswoman Suzan DelBene has introduced legislation that would create a national data privacy law in the US.With no federal law currently in place to protect the data of US citizens, a number of states have enacted their own legislation to do so instead.The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was enacted in 2018, for instance, while Massachusetts has its own Data Breach Notification Act.Patchwork confusionDelBene this week (March 10) introduced her proposal for the Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act that she argued would “will bring our laws into the 21st Century”.Representative DelBene wrote in a statement: “In our digital world, a patchwork of different state laws will lead to confusion for people and businesses.“A national standard is necessary to establish a uniform set of rights for consumers and create one set of rules for businesses to operate in.”The proposed law would protect personal information related to finance, health, biometrics, geolocation, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, citizenship and immigration status, and social security numbers.Read more of the latest cybersecurity news from the USIt will also govern how the information of citizens under the age of 13 is kept safe.The bill will require organizations to provide privacy policies in what it deems ‘plain English’ and will mandate that consumers must opt-in before their data can be used.Organizations will have to disclose when and how consumers’ personal information will be shared and undertake privacy audits, conducted by an independent third party, every two years.Privacy isn’t just a tech issueThe bill draws inspiration from other data privacy laws, “the obvious one” being Europe’s GDPR, Representative DelBene told The Daily Swig.“The Europeans have not been shy about their desire to have GDPR set the global standard for data protection.“While there are parts of my proposal that would bring the US into harmony with GDPR, my legislation would not stifle innovation and potentially put our startup community at a competitive disadvantage. If we don’t have a clear domestic policy, we won’t be able to shape standards abroad and we risk letting others drive global policy.”READ EU-US Privacy Shield data-sharing framework declared invalid by ECJDelBene added: “I came from a tech background, so I understand the issue but that’s pretty rare for a member of Congress.“A lot of the conversations I have with other lawmakers is explaining how privacy isn’t just a siloed technology issue but impacts every aspect of our modern lives.

no,Regexploit tool unveiled with a raft of ReDoS bugs already on its resume,Optional whitespaces were ‘a recurring source of vulnerabilities’ in regex implementations,"UPDATED A newly launched regex-scanning tool has been used by its architects to unearth multiple regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities in popular NPM, Python, and Ruby dependencies.Released yesterday (March 11), Regexploit extracts regular expressions and scans them for widespread security weaknesses that, if exploited, can “bring a server to its knees”, said Doyensec researcher Ben Caller in a technical blog post.Upon finding a suspected ReDoS issue, researchers from the appsec firm manually tried to reach the developers of applications with dubious regexes that allowed untrusted input.What is a ReDoS attack?Web apps with a search function often make use of regular expressions, or ‘regex’, which allow the user (or developer) to define a search pattern.In some scenarios, specially crafted strings can force computations that overwhelm an app’s regex engine, causing the underlying web servers to work themselves to a standstill.This is known as a ‘regular expression denial-of-service’ (ReDoS) attack.Unlike DDoS attacks, ReDoS can be achieved with as little as a single request.“While ReDoS is certainly not new, many developers still remain unaware of the danger of computational-expensive regular expressions,” Luca Carettoni, co-founder of Doyensec, told The Daily Swig. “We've had success detecting exploitable regexes in all sorts of open-source software and during client engagements.”Regexploit: Perfect matchWhereas similar hacking tools typically hunt for regexes with “exponential worst-case complexity” (eg, (a+)+b), Regexploit can also flag serious security risks in cubic complexity regexes (such as a+a+a+b).The tool, which has built-in support for extracting regexes from Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, JSON, and YAML, “tries to find ambiguities where a single character could be captured by multiple repeating parts”.RELATED Unpatched regex bug leaves Node.js apps open to ReDoS attacksIt then attempts to make the regular expression not match in order to force the regex engine to backtrack, explained Caller.Poorly designed regexes, “where input can be matched in different ways”, can mean that malicious input triggers resource-intensive backtracking loops of the sort that caused an outage at Cloudflare in 2019.Mishandling optional whitespaceThe mishandling of optional whitespace was “a recurring source of vulnerabilities”, as was the case with a cubic ReDoS bug in how cpython’s http.cookiejar processed cookie expiry dates with compatibility for certain deprecated date formats.If a remote, malicious server responded to a HTTP request like requests.get('http://evil.server') with Set-Cookie form headers, said Caller, Python’s 65,506-space limit on HTTP header lines means “the client will take over a week to finish processing the header.”Read more about the latest hacking toolsThe researchers also noticed that the “troublesome regexes” they uncovered “had mostly remained untouched since they first entered the codebase”.This, Caller speculated, indicated that not only had they caused “no issues in normal conditions”, but were perhaps also “too illegible to maintain”.Doyensec’s Luca Carettoni said “feedback and engagement on our social channels” in relation to Regexploit “have been overwhelmingly positive”.After being contacted by The Daily Swig for comment, security researcher Somdev Sangwan tested Regexploit against three exploitable regexes that he had previously found in ModSecurity CRS and “it was able to flag two of them.“This is a much-needed tool and it works well,” he added. “Being an open-source project, it will only get better with time.” MitigationsCaller said whitespace ambiguity could be addressed by using a simple regex and trimming spaces adjacent to the result.He also advised developers to consider using “‘possessive quantifiers’ to mark sections as non-backtrackable”, where practical, and consider using deterministic finite automaton to ensure regex matching unfolds in “linear time regardless of input” (albeit this can entail a performance trade-off, as with Google’s RE2 regex engine).This article was updated on March 12 with comments from researcher Somdev Sangwan, and again on March 15 with comments from Luca Carettoni of Doyensec.DON’T FORGET TO READ Blind regex injection: Theoretical exploit offers new means of forcing web apps to spill secrets",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/regexploit-tool-unveiled-with-a-raft-of-redos-bugs-already-on-its-resume,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'DDoS', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'GitHub', 'Python']"
no,"Linux community project aims to tackle dependency confusion attacks with easy code signing, verification",Sigstore: a Let’s Encrypt for software integrity,"Google has teamed up with the Linux community on a new project that aims to make open source software more secure through easy code signing and verification.The project – dubbed ‘sigstore’ – is spearheaded by the Linux Foundation and aims to use digital signature technology to ensure supply chain integrity and defend against software supply chain attacks.BACKGROUND Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowIn a blog post, Google cites the recent run of so-called ‘dependency confusion’ attacks and the abuse of malicious RubyGems packages to steal cryptocurrency as examples of the kinds of attacks that sigstore is gearing up to frustrate.Described as a ‘Let’s Encrypt for code signing’, sigstore is designed to make it straightforward for developers to sign software releases and for users to verify them. The service will be free to use.Chain of trustLet’s Encrypt provides free SSL certificates and automation tooling for websites to run on HTTPS. In a similar manner, sigstore provides free certificates and tooling to automate and verify signatures of source code. The approach is backed by transparency logs.Without such tooling and checks, the software supply chain will continue to be riddled with contamination and malfeasance, according to Google.“Installing most open source software today is equivalent to picking up a random thumb drive off the sidewalk and plugging it into your machine. To address this, we need to make it possible to verify the provenance of all software - including open source packages,” explains the blog post.Since long-term key management is hard, sigstore is based on short-lived certificates based on OpenID Connect grants.RELATED Linux Foundation aims to improve the sustainability and security of open source projectsTo get around key distribution problems, sigstore is designed around a Root CA (certificate authority) for code signing.Transparency Logs, backed by Trillian, offer a built-in fallback mechanism that will allow the system to detect and recover from any compromise.A statement by the Linux Foundation explains: “Sigstore will empower software developers to securely sign software artifacts such as release files, container images and binaries. Signing materials are then stored in a tamper-proof public log.”Work in progressAlthough still in its early days, working prototypes of the technology have been developed by software engineers from Google, Linux distributor Red Hat, and the wider open source community.The Linux Foundation was heavily involved with the project. The overall design of sigstore was put together by start-up vendor Smallstep.Other developers and partners are encouraged to get involved with plans to further develop the project by hardening the system, adding support for other OpenID Connect providers, and more.Read more of the latest DevSecOps newsEarly reaction to the project has largely been favorable.Maya Kaczorowski, a program manager for software supply chain security at GitHub, commented on Twitter: “This is a huge step in the right direction of what we need for software supply chain security.”Others, however, struck a note of caution by alluding to the possibility that cybercriminals or worse will abuse the technology for their own nefarious purposes.Security blogger Nikos Vaggalis said in a blog post that while Sigstore is on the ""right track"" it fails to mitigate all supply chain hazards, something he argues is in any case impossible.""Sigstore is a decent attempt to secure the supply chain, mitigating most of the dangers, but not all,"" Vaggalis writes. ""[A trojanised] npm case still relies on the maintainer manually and meticulously scanning the code of the PR, a process that could very well fail to identify its malicious intent.""In response to queries from The Daily Swig to the Linux Foundation, a representative said the sigstore Project was actively considering how to harden the technology is order to guard against potential attack:Like many open source projects, we've shared the news about the sigstore development work to open up contributions and invite community members to participate. We're also looking for critical input on things like UX, APIs, use cases and designs.We know how important this service can be and we want as many people involved as possible, and the feedback and contribution will be key to hardening the final sigstore service.We know how to harden systems like this and will be doing so before we recommend anyone rely on the system.

no,Tsao vs. Captiva – How a US data breach court case could have major impact on the legal definition of ‘harm’,"Successful data breach class action litigation may soon depend on the location where the lawsuit is filed, writes attorney David Oberly","ANALYSIS Recently, the US Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals weighed in on one of the most critical issues in data breach class action litigation – Article III standing – upholding in Tsao vs. Captiva MVP Restaurant Partners, LLC, that an increased risk of future identity theft faced by data breach victims does not alone satisfy the ‘injury-in-fact’ element of the standing analysis.This opinion widened the already-significant circuit split between US federal appellate courts regarding the level of harm that must be shown to establish a cognizable ‘injury-in-fact’ for purposes of standing in data breach class actions and, more specifically, whether alleged injuries relating to an increased risk of future identity theft are sufficient to satisfy this prong of the standing test.What is Article III standing?In legal parlance, ‘standing’ is the legal right for an individual to bring a claim in court.‘Article III standing’ refers to the Case or Controversy Clause of the US Constitution (located in Article III, Section 2, Clause 1), which is the basis for many important court decisions addressing standing.To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must establish three core elements: an injury-in-fact, causation, and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.Where a plaintiff seeks to establish an injury-in-fact based on an imminent injury, that threatened harm must be “certainly impending”. At the very least, this requires showing that there is a “substantial risk” that the harm will occur.Tsao vs. CaptivaThe Tsao case (WL 381948; 11th Circuit; February 4, 2021) arose out of a security incident suffered by PDQ, a group of American fast dining restaurants owned by Captiva MVP Restaurant Partners.Less than two weeks after PDQ posted its notice to consumers that it had been the target of a cyber-attack involving its point-of-sale system, the plaintiff, I Tan Tsao, filed suit to recover damages stemming from the breach.Tsao argued that he had been harmed, and thus had standing, due to an elevated risk of identity theft or, alternatively, because he took proactive steps to mitigate the risk of identity theft.Fast dining chain PDQ was hit by a data breach in 2018The Eleventh Circuit’s opinionOn appeal, the Eleventh Circuit rejected both arguments and upheld the district court’s prior dismissal of the suit for lack of Article III standing.In doing so, the Tsao court held that a plaintiff alleging a threat of future identity theft or other harm lacks Article III standing unless the hypothetical harm alleged is either certainly impending or there is a substantial risk of such harm taking place.Read more of the latest cybersecurity policy and legislation newsImportantly, to make this showing a plaintiff must present evidence of at least some misuse of class members’ data.Conversely, evidence of a mere breach – standing alone – is insufficient of satisfying the requirements of Article III standing for data breach plaintiffs in the Eleventh Circuit pursuant to Tsao.Taken together, arguments that data breach plaintiffs could suffer future injury from misuse of their personal information disclosed during a breach – but where no actual misuse has occurred – and the risk of misuse by itself are now foreclosed in the Eleventh Circuit pursuant to Tsao.Further, pursuant to Tsao, if the future harm alleged is not certainly impending and there is no substantial risk of harm, a plaintiff cannot manufacture standing by inflicting direct harm on himself/herself to mitigate a perceived risk.Implications for data breach class action litigationTo date, the Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and DC Circuits have all found an increased risk of future identity theft sufficient to establish Article III standing in data breach class action litigation.Conversely, the Second, Third, Fourth, and Eighth Circuits have found such allegations fall short of demonstrating a cognizable injury-in-fact in the breach context.In Tsao, the Eleventh Circuit joined the latter camp in holding that an increased risk of future identity theft is alone insufficient to establish standing in data breach litigation.The final wordData breaches are here to stay, despite even the most robust efforts to prevent security incidents. As such, companies must be prepared to aggressively defend data breach class action suits in the event the need arises.While the Tsao case serves to further widen the circuit split, the opinion also provides a blueprint for organizations to procure an early exit from a wide range of future data breach class action lawsuits.RECOMMENDED European Data Protection Board lays out data breach notification guidelines for organizationsFor consumers, Tsao shows that successful data breach class action litigation in the US may depend heavily on the location where the lawsuit is filed, due to the wide divide between federal appellate courts on the necessary threshold to establish standing to sue in federal court.Importantly, facts that may satisfy the requirements for standing in one federal circuit court of appeals may be categorically insufficient to establish standing in another.Ultimately, this significant uncertainty may continue apace for the foreseeable future until the US Supreme Court decides to step in and provide a definitive ruling on this hot-button issue which, in turn, would allow for much-needed consistent application of the law as it relates to standing across all federal courts throughout the country.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/tsao-vs-captiva-how-a-us-data-breach-court-case-could-have-major-impact-on-the-legal-definition-of-harm,"['US', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'North', 'America', 'Legal', 'Privacy', 'Industry', 'News', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Retail', 'E-Commerce']"
no,Critical RCE bug patched in Netgear ProSAFE Plus switches,Network admins also offered mitigation advice for numerous other unpatched vulnerabilities,"UPDATED The most serious of a raft of security vulnerabilities found in two Netgear ProSAFE Plus networking switches could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on affected devices.Organizations using models JGS516PE and GS116Ev2 have been urged to update their systems after security researchers from NCC Group uncovered 15 flaws in the devices’ firmware.However, Netgear, a networking products vendor, told researchers that it cannot fix several vulnerabilities affecting the Netgear Switch Discovery Protocol (NSDP), including five high-risk flaws, “due to hardware limitations” that preclude the implementation of many “standard encryption protocols”, according to an NCC Group technical advisory published on March 8.Steps for preventing exploitation have been provided instead.The bugs “were known due to end-of-life years ago”, but the NSDP protocol “is still enabled for legacy reasons”, explained NCC Group IT security consultant Manuel Ginés Rodríguez.Unrestricted debuggingThe RCE bug (CVE-2020-26919), which has a critical CVSS score of 9.8, arose because the switch internal management web application “failed to correctly implement access controls in one of its endpoints, allowing unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and execute actions with administrator privileges”, said the researcher.NCC Group “found that every section of the web could be used as a valid endpoint to submit POST requests being the action defined by the submitId argument”.RCE was possible because the login.html webpage failed to implement restrictions for executing debug actions.RECOMMENDED Critical database destruction vulnerability patched in Kentico CMSMaking a hash of itThe most serious high-risk flaw (CVE-2020-35231), with a CVSS 8.8, allowed for an authentication bypass of NSDP when the discovery protocol, which manages switch configurations, failed to request a random token that subsequently generates a password hash for authenticated requests.“When no other random number has been requested from last reboot it seems to be [storing] an empty value and the system will accept as valid an empty authentication hash,” added Rodríguez.As a result, “a remote unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted authentication packages to execute any management actions in the device, including wiping the configuration by executing a factory restoration.”Read more of the latest hardware security newsIn the absence of a fix for this and several other high and medium severity bugs, network admins are advised to “leave disabled the remote management feature and stop using the Pro Safe Plus Configuration Utility to modify the switch configuration.”Netgear said a fix will also not be forthcoming for a high-risk stored cross-site scripting bug (CVE-2020-35228) and a buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2020-35227) in its network switch admin web panel.Instead, network admins should deploy switches behind firewalls, restrict web management access to known hosts and exercise “extreme caution” when using the application “due to the lack of protocol encryption”.Another noteworthy high-risk flaw (CVE-2020-35220) with a CVSS of 8.3 meant unauthenticated attackers could “upload outdated versions of the firmware containing other vulnerabilities, upload invalid data to [leave] the device bricked or even upload custom firmware files that may include malicious code, such as backdoors”.“Our findings highlight the importance of building security into the development life cycle, as introducing changes into legacy software at a later stage can be very difficult,” Rodríguez told The Daily Swig.“Proactivity in terms of testing and addressing security issues early in the development process, along with the ongoing application of security practices such as bug bounty programmes, can go a long way towards improving the security of devices on a long-term basis.”TimelineAll flaws apply only to version 2.6.0.43 save for the RCE bug, which only affects prior releases.NCC Group, a UK-headquartered cybersecurity firm, alerted the vendor on September 1, 2020, and provided vulnerability details on September 5.Netgear published a security advisory for the most critical issue on September 17 and rolled out firmware v2.6.0.48 remedying the other flaws on December 2.“Vendor communication was really smooth” and the “Netgear team were extremely collaborative in the vulnerability disclosure process,” concluded Rodríguez.The Daily Swig has also contacted Netgear with additional questions and we will update the article accordingly if we receive a response.This article was updated on March 15 with additional comments from Manuel Gines Rodríguez of NCC Group.RELATED SAP addresses critical double trouble as Microsoft patches obsolete Internet

no,SAP addresses critical double trouble as Microsoft patches obsolete Internet Explorer,Patch Tuesday meets March Madness,"Nine security updates released by enterprise software giant SAP on Tuesday (March 9) include fixes for two newly discovered and critical vulnerabilities.A critical code injection vulnerability in SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence (MII) – tracked as CVE-2021-21480 – earns a near-maximum severity CVSS score of 9.9.SAP MII allows users to create dashboards and save them as JSP (Jakarta Server Pages).Security shortcomings mean that an attacker might be able to intercept a request to the server, inject malicious JSP code in the request, and forward it to the server – a form of MitM attack.This opens the door to all manner of further attacks, as a bulletin from US National Vulnerability Database’s CVE List explains:When this dashboard is opened by Users having at least SAP_XMII_Developer role, malicious content in the dashboard gets executed, leading to remote code execution in the server, which allows privilege escalation.The malicious JSP code can contain certain OS commands, through which an attacker can read sensitive files in the server, modify files or even delete contents in the server, thus compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the server hosting the SAP MII application.Migration migrainesA missing authorization check in SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (MigrationService) – tracked as CVE-2021-21481 – earns a similarly critical rating of 9.6.The security flaw creates a means for remote attackers to take full control of vulnerable systems.RECOMMENDED GitHub users forcibly logged out of accounts to patch ‘potentially serious’ security bug“The MigrationService, which is part of SAP NetWeaver versions 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, does not perform an authorization check,” a CVE List notice explains. “This might allow an unauthorized attacker to access configuration objects, including such that grant administrative privileges.”“This could result in complete compromise of system confidentiality, integrity, and availability,” the note adds.HANA auth bypassA high risk potential authentication bypass in SAP HANA LDAP (CVE-2021-21484) is the most noteworthy among the rest of the batch.The SAP HANA database vulnerability means that “LDAP authentication in SAP HANA Database version 2.0 can be bypassed if the attached LDAP directory server is configured to enable unauthenticated bind”.Other updates release on Tuesday (March 9) cover less severe flaws in SAP’s enterprise software packages, alongside updates on security notes to three previously addressed vulnerabilities from 2020 and one from 2018.An overview of the patches it released on Tuesday from SAP can be found in a post on the vendor’s wiki.Edge of darknessEarlier this month, Microsoft released out-of-band updates for Exchange Server in response to active attacks that had already compromised an estimated 30,000 mail servers.Redmond followed up on Tuesday with updates for older, no longer supported versions of Microsoft Exchange.Microsoft also took the opportunity to release updates for its obsolete Internet Explorer browser for similar reasons.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsAdam Bunn, lead software engineer of Rapid7, the firm behind the Metasploit penetration testing tool, commented: “Since going end-of-life in November 2020, we haven’t seen any Internet Explorer patches from Microsoft.“However, this month Microsoft has made two new updates available: CVE-2021-27085 and CVE-2021-26411. CVE-2021-26411 has been exploited in the wild, so don’t delay applying patches if IE is still in your environment.”The CVE-2021-26411 vulnerability – which creates a remote code execution (RCE) risk – also affects Microsoft Edge on multiple versions of Windows, prompting the release of updates to Microsoft’s latest browser software.Exploit scenarios for both IE and Edge include tricking an intended victim into visiting a maliciously constructed website.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/sap-addresses-critical-double-trouble-as-microsoft-patches-obsolete-internet-explorer,"['Vulnerabilities', 'MitM', 'RCE', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Windows', 'Database', 'Security', 'Browsers', 'Microsoft', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Authentication']"
no,Git vulnerability could enable remote code execution attacks during clone process,"Update to the latest version now, say developers","The Git Project has patched a vulnerability that could result in remote code execution.The bug – tracked as CVE-2021-21300 – is present in several versions of the open source code management system, and could allow a hostile remote repository to execute code locally during a clone operation.Crucially, the vulnerability only affects users with case-insensitive filesystems that enable support for symbolic links. Files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS must also be enabled for the attack to work.Read more of the latest remote code execution newsAn announcement released yesterday (March 9) reads: “On case-insensitive file systems with support for symbolic links, if Git is configured globally to apply delay-capable clean/smudge filters (such as Git LFS), Git could be fooled into running remote code during a clone.”A security advisory reads: “In affected versions of Git, a specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause just-checked out script to be executed while cloning onto a case-insensitive file system such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e., the default file systems on Windows and macOS).“Note that clean/smudge filters have to be configured for that.”Git users are urged to update as soon as possible. The release fixes the bug in versions 2.17.6 through to 2.30.2.Copycat problemsGit users often clone an existing repository for various reasons, such as building on a fully fledged copy from elsewhere or keeping a copy of their project in case the server disk is corrupted.Since the RCE vulnerability only affects case-insensitive filesystems, not all Git users are vulnerable to exploitation.MacOS – which enabled case-insensitive filesystems by default – is particularly open to attack, multiple sources have warned, as is Windows, which configures Git LFS by default.READ Git developers release test code to transition away from aging SHA-1 hashing“As a workaround, if symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g via git config --global core.symlinks false), the described attack won’t work.“Likewise, if no clean/smudge filters such as Git LFS are configured globally (i.e _before_ cloning), the attack is foiled. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources,” the advisory reads.Other operating systems such as Linux – which is case-sensitive by default – are presumed to be safe, however users should still heed caution.“This vulnerability affects case-insensitive file systems, therefore typical Linux scenarios should be safe,” wrote Red Hat software engineer Huzaifa Sidhpurwala.“However as per upstream exploitation is even possible on Linux under certain circumstances.”Improving user safetyGit was created back in 2005 by Linus Torvalds as a system to track changes in source code for the Linux kernel.In recent years, it has undergone major changes including moving away from the aging SHA-1 hashing algorithm to a more secure alternative.However, moving to a stronger hash has proved to be a tricky migration since in the early days of Git, Torvalds was “unconcerned about the possibility of SHA?1 being broken”, and therefore he never designed in the ability to switch to a different hash.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Git security: Newline injection bug tricked version control system into leaking usernames and password",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/git-vulnerability-could-enable-remote-code-execution-attacks-during-clone-process,"['RCE', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Apple', 'Windows', 'Microsoft', 'Linux', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Network', 'Security', 'Encryption', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software']"
no,Database destruction vulnerability patched in old Kentico CMS build,Long-since fixed SQL injection bug could allow an unauthenticated attacker to tamper with databases,"UPDATED Users of older Kentico CMS builds have been urged to migrate to the most recent supported version of the software following the discovery of a vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise backend databases.Kentico CMS is an ASP.NET content management system (CMS) for enterprise websites, e-commerce, and both intranet and extranet domains.The CMS comes with features (PDF) including built-in modules, text editing, blogs, and polls, and is used on over 4,000 websites in 83 countries.SQL injection flawA security vulnerability in the 5.5 R2 5.5.3996 version of Kentico CMS was disclosed by Obrela Labs penetration tester Anastasios Stasinopoulos on March 8.The flaw, tracked as CVE-2021-27581, resides in the blog functionality module of Kentico CMS, which permits SQL injection attacks to occur via the tagname parameter, such as -- http://target.com/blog?tagname=injectable.According to Obrela Labs, the CMS security flaw “allowed a potential attacker – without requiring authentication – to interact with the backend Microsoft SQL server database”.Read more of the latest SQL injection newsSpeaking to the The Daily Swig, Stasinopoulos said that “it seems that the root cause is improper sanitization within portal engine components, which is typical for this type of security flaw”.The researcher said that if successfully exploited, attackers could not only access data stored in a backend database, but could also tamper with or delete information outright.In addition, as long as “specific parameters” are met, the vulnerability could lead to the “complete compromise of the underlying operating system that hosts Kentico”.Stasinopoulos said that these conditions could include elevated privileges of a functional account used by Kentico to connect to the backend database, stacked queries being permissible on the vulnerable parameter, or the xp_cmdshell stored procedure being enabled, either by default or by an attacker.Old newsFollowing the publication of this article, a Kentico spokesperson told The Daily Swig that this issue had been discovered internally and patched more than 10 years ago, in version 5.5.R2.13 of the software.“We really appreciate any report from independent security researchers who help us to keep our product more secure,” said Kentico CISO Juraj Komlosi.“However… this issue was fixed in Kentico CMS version 5.5.R2.13. The date of the fix: 11th of March 2011.“In 2011 it was reported by a Kentico developer and properly fixed in the hotfix. That’s the reason why we thank to Anastasios, but he was not the first who found this issue and he reported us a 10-year-old fixed issue.”With the impact of this bug limited only to those running outdated Kentico versions, Komlosi said the time was now for any remaining stragglers to update.“It’s the same as someone was still using Windows XP,” he said. “If the version you use is not supported anymore and you want to make sure there are no major functional or security bugs you have to upgrade to the latest supported version.

no,"Abuse.ch creator launches ThreatFox, a platform for sharing malware indicators of compromise","OSINT resource used to share C2 servers, payloads, and other IoCs","A platform for sharing and requesting indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with different malware strains is the latest open source intelligence (OSINT) service launched by Abuse.ch.Unveiling the platform in a blog post this week, Roman Hussy, the Swiss security expert behind Abuse.ch, says he envisages ThreatFox being used by “security researchers, threat analysts, CERT/CSIRT/SOC employees” and infosec enthusiasts to share threat intelligence with the infosec community, antivirus vendors, and threat intelligence providers.Contributors can share – anonymously if they prefer – domains, IP addresses, email addresses, and file hashes associated with malware, botnet command and control (C2) servers, payloads, and payload delivery mechanisms.BACKGROUND OSINT: What is open source intelligence and how is it used?Users can also browse existing IoCs to enhance their visibility of the threat landscape, submit requests for IoCs, or browse existing IoC requests.As well as using the web interface, threat analysts can use the ThreatFox API to integrate the service into their security information and event management (SIEM) and other infrastructure.ThreatFox users can search for malware samples by hash, ClamAV signature, and moreIoC taxonomyEvery IoC is associated with a malware family based on Malepdia’s malware-naming scheme.ThreatFox contributors assign a confidence level between 0%-100% to reflect their level of conviction that an IoC, “if observed in a production environment, would indicate a compromise of your network with malware”.They are encouraged to assign high scores only to IoCs they have manually vetted and to only share IoCs that are up to 10 days old.Contributors can also add comments and external references such as links to white papers or social media posts.RECOMMENDED Williams Racing aborts plans to unveil new F1 car via augmented reality app following hackTrust systemFive ‘credits’ are awarded for each valid IoC, unless the IoC fulfils criteria for specific requests, for which requestors set rewards of up to 100 credits.ThreatFox users who share high quality IoCs may in future be flagged as a ‘Trusted Reporter’, in which case subsequent submissions will be accepted without further vetting.IoCs can be exported in MISP events, JSON, CSV, and Suricata IDS ruleset formats, among others.A statistics page charts the number of IoCs submitted over time – more than 3,000 since submissions began in December 2020, at the time of writing – the most active malware families, IoCs by type, most popular tags, and a league table of the most prolific contributors.Incident response time-saverHussy launched the registration-free ThreatFox service because existing equivalent platforms require registration to share or retrieve IoCs, meaning IoCs are often shared publicly on GitHub or Twitter.This, he said, can throw up hurdles because “you need to invest a lot of time into searching for these IoCs and, even worse, automation is in many cases not easily possible (if not impossible)”.“The goal of Abuse.ch always was to make threat intelligence [easily] accessible for everyone – for free, and without the need of a registration on a platform,” he said.Catch up on the latest malware newsThe ThreatFox website and API complement Abuse.ch’s malware sample sharing site MalwareBazaar, which was launched in 2020, and URLhaus, unveiled in 2018 as a means to share malware distribution sites.Abuse.ch, a non-profit project that relies on community donations, also operates ‘I Got Phished’, a repository of information about phishing victims launched in 2020, the SSL Blacklist (SSLBL), established in 2014, and Feodo Tracker, a resource for sharing Feodo-associated botnet C2 servers launched in 2010.The arrival of ThreatFox also follows the launch, by security researcher John Page in January, of Malvuln.com, a repository of code for exploiting security flaws in malware.The Daily Swig has contacted Roman Hussy with further questions and we will update the article accordingly should we receive a reply.RECOMMENDED Introducing Malvuln.com – the first website ‘exclusively dedicated’ to revealing security vulnerabilities in malware",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/abuse-ch-creator-launches-threatfox-a-platform-for-sharing-malware-indicators-of-compromise,"['Malware', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Phishing', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Antivirus', 'Industry', 'News', 'Switzerland', 'Europe', 'Research', 'Ransomware', 'Email', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Privacy']"
no,All mapped out: Researchers uncover hidden flaws in Apple’s offline ‘find my device’ feature,Bluetooth tracking system earns plaudits from independent security analysis despite recently resolved flaw,"The security and privacy of Apple’s Bluetooth location-tracking system has earned praise from researchers who uncovered two implementation flaws in the technology.Apple’s OF (Offline Finding) technology makes use of online finder devices running the ‘Find My’ app to detect the presence of missing offline devices such as iPads using Bluetooth and AirTags.The ‘crowdsourced’ system reports an approximate location for a device back to the owner via the internet.Computer scientists from Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany uncovered a brace of issues after carrying out a detailed analysis of the privacy-focused system.Reverse engineeringDuring what’s reckoned to be the first comprehensive security and privacy analysis of Apple’s OF technology, the team of four computer scientists first mapped out the design of the closed-source protocols using reverse engineering techniques.The team went on to show that an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the location reports, allowing for accurate device tracking and the ability to retrieve a user’s frequently visited locations to within a distance of 10 metres, at least in urban areas.More specifically the researchers went on to uncover two distinct design and implementation flaws which they said could lead to a ‘location correlation attack’ and unauthorized access to recent location history.RELATED Telegram for macOS failed to self-destruct messages on local devicesThe researchers disclosed their findings to Apple last year. In response, the technology giant addressed their main concern through an update. The other (less serious) implementation flaw remains unaddressed.The unauthorized access of location history vulnerability allows any “third-party app on the Mac to decrypt the location reports created by any of your devices whenever they were offline”, Alexander Heinrich, one of the researchers, told The Daily Swig.What’s your location?Apple’s OF technology means that a MacBook that is in your bag, and normally offline, would be pinged by other devices around you (like your own iPhone), which would find it and report the encrypted location to Apple in the event that it was lost or stolen.Apple's technology aims to ensure finder anonymity, that owner devices are not trackable, and the confidentiality of location reports. These locations are encrypted, but a flaw in the implementation of the technology meant all the private keys were exposed in a publicly accessible directory on macOS.“Just by reading this directory it was possible to download and decrypt the location reports for all devices that were connected to the same iCloud account,” Heinrich explained.The implementation issue – tracked as CVE-2020-9986 – was resolved by Apple last year.Read more of the latest Apple security newsMilan Stute, another member of the research team, explained that a second, more esoteric issue meant that Apple might be able to correlate user locations.This potential design issue “would require Apple to store certain meta data about the report uploads/downloads (which we don’t know if they do – but it's technically possible)”, according to Stute.Apple has not indicated to the researcher that it plans to address this issue. The technology giant didn’t respond to a request for comment on the research as a whole from The Daily Swig.The researchers detailed their findings in full in a paper (PDF) entitled, ‘Who Can Find My Devices? Security and Privacy of Apple’s Crowd-Sourced Bluetooth Location Tracking System’.Best in showDespite finding potential shortcomings with Apple’s location-tracking system both Stute and Heinrich were complimentary about the technology.“Apple’s design is actually very clever and sophisticated,” according to Stute. “So far, it’s the best that we have seen out there (e.g., compared to Tile).”Heinrich added: “All the similar systems that we know of at the moment do not use any encryption. Even worse many of them had issues with the access control to their servers so others could track such devices very easily.“So, the first thing those developers need to change is to use similar methods as Apple to encrypt the location data,” he concluded.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/all-mapped-out-researchers-uncover-hidden-flaws-in-apples-offline-find-my-device-feature,"['Apple', 'Mobile', 'Privacy', 'Network', 'Security', 'Encryption', 'Research', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Authentication']"

We can only apologise that this has not been possible.”Williams Racing, which is F1’s second most successful team of all time, is hoping to restore lost glories with its freshly liveried car after finished dead last in each of the last two seasons, the most recent of which it failed to earn a single point in the Constructors’ Championship.The 2021 season, which begins on March 28, is also the motor racing team’s first full season under new ownership after founder Sir Frank Williams sold the team to investment firm Dorilton Capital last year.In February, Williams Racing announced an extension to a partnership initiated in 2018 with cybersecurity firm Acronis, which will continue to be the team’s official ‘Cyber Protection Partner’ and provide data backup, protection, and recovery services.The Daily Swig has contacted Williams Racing for further details about the hack and will update the article accordingly should we receive a response.DON’T FORGET TO READ Security researchers warn of critical zero-day flaws in ‘age gap’ dating app Gaper",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/williams-racing-aborts-plans-to-unveil-new-f1-car-via-augmented-reality-app-following-hack,"['Cyber-attacks', 'UK', 'Mobile', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Europe', 'Automotive', 'Organizations']"
no,GitHub users forcibly logged out of accounts to patch ‘potentially serious’ security bug,Vulnerability has the potential to expose users’ session cookies,"GitHub users were forcibly signed out of their accounts yesterday (March 8) to protect against a security bug that could have exposed a user’s session cookies.The maintainers of GitHub explained that they invalidated all authenticated sessions “out of an abundance of caution to protect users from an extremely rare, but potentially serious, security vulnerability”, which it said affected a “small number” of users.In a blog post, GitHub said that the vulnerability – a race condition in a backend request handling process – could have misrouted a user’s session to the browser of another authenticated user, giving them the valid and authenticated session cookie for another user.“It is important to note that this issue was not the result of compromised account passwords, SSH keys, or personal access tokens (PATs),” the blog post reads.It adds: “There is no evidence to suggest that this was the result of a compromise of any other GitHub systems. Instead, this issue was due to the rare and isolated improper handling of authenticated sessions.“Further, this issue could not be intentionally triggered or directed by a malicious user.”Suspicious behaviorThe incident came after a user submitted a report of “anomalous” behavior on their GitHub account.“Upon receiving the report, GitHub Security and Engineering immediately began investigating to understand the root cause, impact, and prevalence of this issue on GitHub.com,” the company said.Read more of the latest security vulnerability news“We took initial corrective action to patch the vulnerability on March 5 and continued our analysis throughout the weekend.”The bug existed on GitHub between February 8 and March 5.

Elara learned of the unauthorized access on December 9, and promptly mitigated the incident, changing passwords and denying access to the intruder as accounts were identified.”The incident was fully contained by December 16, reported Elara Caring. The FBI have been informed.The healthcare provider said it forced an company-wide password change and implemented multifactor authentication for all users of its systems.It also conducted “enhanced security training” for its personnel to “better detect and prevent phishing scams”.Elara is offering a free two-year membership of Experian services to all affected individuals.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Florida Healthy Kids blames health insurance data breach on third-party hack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/data-breach-at-healthcare-provider-elara-caring-exposes-100-000-patients-information,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Healthcare', 'Phishing', 'US', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Network', 'Security', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Cybercrime', 'Email', 'Security', 'HIPAA', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Organizations']"
no,UK cybersecurity spending on the rise despite pandemic-induced budget cuts,"Coronavirus has increased the infosec workload, but redundancies and recruitment freezes are still widespread, according to a new report","UPDATED Two in three UK-based organizations are likely to increase their cybersecurity spending in 2021 despite the unprecedented financial toll exacted by Covid-19, according to a survey of infosec decision-makers.A report from information security giant NCC Group reveals that just 7% of respondents from public and private sector organizations anticipate overall budgetary cuts, suggesting a widespread determination to ringfence cybersecurity spending amid an increasingly complex threat landscape.However, 27% reported cuts to cyber-resilience budgets in 2020, and three in 10 reported delays or cancellations to cyber-resilience projects.Recruitment freezesThe survey of 290 senior infosec professionals suggested many security teams’ headcounts were being reduced because of a pandemic that simultaneously increased their workload.With Covid-19 being exploited by cybercriminals and forcing hasty migrations to a remote workforce, 40% of organizations froze infosec recruitment, 29% made redundancies, and one in five furloughed staff.RELATED More than half of women in infosec are treated unequally to male colleagues due to ‘blatant sexism’ in the workplace – reportTwo-thirds (66%) of those polled said they planned to plug the gap with outsourcing in 2021, 50% of whom cited recruitment and retention as a key motive amid the global cyber-skills shortage.“Ideally, organisations should outsource to complement and strengthen their internal resources rather than replace them,” Stephen Bailey, head of cyber and privacy consulting at NCC Group, told The Daily Swig. “However, with budgets stretched during the pandemic, outsourcing offers decision makers a quick and cost-effective way to improve their security postures until they can afford to recruit dedicated cyber security people.“It also allows organisations to determine their resource requirements before making firm commitments to recruitment, enabling them to allocate their budgets more effectively,” as well as flexibly address “specific short-term security requirements” that cannot be practically addressed internally.NCC Group observed that organizations that cut budgets or the size of their teams were more likely to suffer cyber-attacks in general, while many respondents blamed home working for rises in insider threats and phishing and ransomware attacks.As a result of these challenges, the proportion of those polled who considered their employer ‘very resilient’ fell from nearly half to 38% year on year.Patchy recordThe survey also hints at a patchy record when it comes to detecting and remediating threats.On the one hand, almost 90% expressed confidence that they could promptly diagnose and remediate the root cause of a potential data breach and alert authorities within 72 hours – as per GDPR regulations.On the other, just 49% of organizations scanned their network perimeter frequently.Catch up with the latest coronavirus security newsAnd despite zero-day vulnerabilities now being exploited in the wild within just three days of public disclosure, 49% confessed to taking a week or more to patch vulnerabilities, while only 21% said all network-connected devices were regularly patched.Effective patch management is contingent on “continuous monitoring”, according to Tim Rawlins, director and senior adviser at NCC Group.“It is more valuable to consider the accuracy of the estate inventory and the time it takes to reduce the vulnerabilities, than the total number of vulnerabilities itself,” he said.Benchmarking resilienceUnderstanding the threat landscape (70%) and securing funding (68%) were seen as the two biggest challenges currently facing organizations.Decision-makers were far from bullish about surmounting these hurdles, however: 71% admitted to being ‘not confident’ about improving their organization’s cybersecurity preparedness.While more than 90% admitted to struggling to evaluate the costs and benefits of cybersecurity measures, only 31% agreed that benchmarking security activities was an effective solution.Dominic Carroll, product manager and service architect at NCC Group, disagreed with the benchmarking dissenters.“Whether you’re establishing how far you’ve come since your last assessment or building a business case for targeted investment, benchmarking your resilience against recognised frameworks such as NIST should be factored into your cyber strategy,” he said.This article was updated on March 9 with the addition of comments from Stephen Bailey of the NCC

no,Ransomware attacks more than doubled last year as cybercrime operations scale up during coronavirus pandemic,"Sobering news for organizations, as average ransom demand closes in on $200,000","The ransomware market, fueled by coronavirus pandemic turbulence, has become the biggest single money earner for cybercriminals, according to a new report.Threat hunting and cyber-intelligence firm Group-IB estimates that the number of ransomware attacks grew by more than 150% in 2020.Ransomware attacks not only grew in numbers but also in scale and sophistication – the average ransom demand increased by more than twofold and amounted to $170,000 in 2020.Ransomware attacks on average caused 18 days of downtime for the affected organizations, while the average ransom amount almost doubled. Demands at the top end of the cyber-extortion scale exceeded $1 million.Running the numbersIn attacks analyzed by Group-IB’s digital forensics and incident response team, publicly accessible Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers were the most commonly used vector to gain initial access (52%), followed by phishing (29%), and exploitation of public-facing applications (17%).The figures are based on an analysis of more than 500 cyber-attacks observed during Group-IB’s own incident response engagements and cyber threat intelligence activity.The number of public-facing RDP servers last year increased enormously as organizations rolled out remote access to support workers obliged to work from home because of Coronavirus-lockdown restrictions.RELATED Coronavirus: How to work from home securely during a period of isolationRansomware operators relied more heavily on commodity malware such as Trickbot, Qakbot, and Dridex to obtain initial access to target networks.The Maze, Conti, and Egregor cybercrime gangs became the biggest source of threats, while North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific became the most commonly attacked regions, respectively.Some gangs operating under the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, such as Egregor and Netwalker, were impacted by the police efforts. Another notorious RaaS collective, Maze, called it quits at the end of 2020.Despite these setbacks, the ransomware business as a whole continued to blossom, with off-the-shelf RaaS offerings turbo-charging the increase.Group-IB researchers estimate that 64% of ransomware attacks it analyzed in 2020 came from operators using the RaaS model. In addition, Group-IB logged the arrival of 15 new public ransomware affiliate programs last year.In addition, a number of botnet operators partnered with ransomware gangs last year.Big game huntingGoing after larger enterprises became a defining trend in the ransomware marketplace last year.“The operators were less concerned about the industry and more focused on scale,” Group-IB reports.Based on the security firm’s observations, in 2020 ransomware operators spent 13 days on average in the compromised network before deploying their system-crippling malware.The intervening period was spent burrowing further into compromised networks (moving latterly from the point of initial compromise), credential dumping, and exfiltrating data, as well as finding and destroying data backups.State sponsored hacking Groups such as Lazarus (linked to North Korea) and APT27 (China) started to use ransomware during their operations, according to Group-IB.Maturing marketOleg Skulkin, senior digital forensics analyst at Group-IB, said that the global ransomware market had matured beyond all recognition over the last year.“From what used to be a rare practice and an end-user concern, ransomware has evolved last year into an organized multibillion industry with competition within, market leaders, strategic alliances, and various business models,” Skulkin said.The market is likely to grow still further over the coming year.Read more of the latest ransomware news“Due to their profitability, the number of RaaS programs will keep growing, more cybercriminals will focus on gaining access to networks for resale purposes,” Skulkin warned.“Data exfiltration effectiveness can make it another big niche, with some actors abandoning the use of ransomware at all.”Group-IB’s digital forensics and incident response team has mapped the most commonly used cybercrime techniques and tactics in 2020, in accordance with Mitre ATT&CK framework.The ‘Ransomware Uncovered 2020-2021’ offers a sitrep on the ransomware threat environment as well as detailing potential mitigation strategies.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ransomware-attacks-more-than-doubled-last-year-as-cybercrime-operations-scale-up-during-coronavirus-pandemic,"['Ransomware', 'Malware', 'Cybercrime', 'North', 'Korea', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Research', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Privacy', 'Coronavirus', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Africa', 'Middle', 'East', 'Oceania', 'Latin', 'America', 'Analysis']"
no,"Open source software repositories play ‘whack-a-mole’ as ‘dependency confusion’ copycats exceed 5,000",Tactic gathers pace as malicious packages proliferate,"Maintainers of the NPM Registry and Python Package Index (PyPI) have removed thousands of rogue packages smuggled into the repositories via the novel ‘dependency confusion’ technique.Less than a month since security researcher Alex Birsan’s disclosure of the new method for infiltrating open source ecosystems, mischief-makers have collectively flooded the two repositories with more than 5,000 packages.Threat actors began imitating Birsan’s exploit within 48 hours of him revealing that his ‘dummy’ packages had successfully breached ecosystems maintained by Apple, Microsoft, and PayPal.BACKGROUND Researcher hacks Apple, Microsoft, and other major tech companies in novel supply chain attackIn a recent blog post, Sonatype security researcher Juan Aguirre said that attackers had initially plagiarized Birsan’s proof-of-concept before “gradually” becoming more “creative”.Dependency confusion attacks seed the software ecosystem with malicious components by overriding privately-used dependency packages with malicious, public packages of the same name. This contrasts with ‘typosquatting’ packages, which instead have similar names to popular packages, an attack tactic that’s besieged repositories in recent years.Proliferating packagesAx Sharma, a senior security researcher at Sonatype, told The Daily Swig that the DevOps automation specialist has identified more than 8,000 ‘dependency confusion’ packages so far. They typosquat repositories, namespaces or components used by the likes of Amazon, Zillow, Lyft, and Slack.Many exfiltrate /etc/shadow files containing hashed passwords or .bash_history files containing usernames and passwords.PyPI maintainers, meanwhile, removed 3,653 suspicious packages associated with a single user on March 1 after the CuPy project reported on February 29 that the imminent release of its cupy-cuda112 package had been hijacked.There was a further development on Wednesday (March 3) as Sonatype revealed that it had discovered a further 1,500 NPM packages emanating from the CuPy attacker.Sharma said NPM had removed the first batch “within a few hours but more keep coming”.“It’s going to be a whack-a-mole situation for the next few weeks, it seems, unless concrete validation is put in place by open source ecosystems,” Sharma warned.RemindSupplyChainRisksSome culprits have purported to have a noble motive, while others have uploaded apparently non-malicious, or moderately malicious, packages.For instance, The PyPI malware author, ‘RemindSupplyChainRisks’, claimed to want everyone to “pay attention to software supply chain attacks, because the risks are too great”.Read more of the latest secure development newsHowever, while Sharma observed that many rogue NPM packages had a “security research purposes only” disclaimer, the spawning of a reverse shell in many cases revealed this to be a possible attempt “to fool the analyst”.The attacks probably presaged further, “more sinister activities” ahead, he predicted.Similarly, software vendor Qentinel has said that packages it recently detected that exploited flawed default behavior in Python package installer pip “were empty placeholder libraries”, speculating that they represented a “trial run” by nefarious actors.Defense in depthLast month Google’s security blog featured a proposal to create “development processes that ensure sufficient review, avoid unilateral changes, and transparently lead to well-defined, verifiable official versions” for software deemed ‘critical’.However, Firefox CTO Eric Rescorla has since warned that such processes would create “friction” for resource-light package developers instead of often “well-funded” dependent projects.Mozilla was instead exploring measures such as “fine-grained sandboxing to contain the impact of compromise”, and ways for component developers “to tag the dependencies they use and depend on” that would serve as an implicit testimonial (manifesting for example as ‘Firefox uses this crate’).Sonatype’s contributions to the defense-in-depth approach required to address the problem, meanwhile, include a ‘dependency/namespace confusion checker’ script that helps developers identify whether they have fallen prey to dependency confusion attacks.A spokesperson for GitHub, which operates the NPM Registry, told The Daily Swig that they “will continue to remove proof-of-concept exploits submitted for security research purposes under the npm Open-Source Terms”, and pointed developers to a blog post containing advice on avoiding dependency confusion attacks.READ MORE Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to know",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/open-source-software-repositories-play-whack-a-mole-as-dependency-confusion-copycats-exceed-5-000,"['Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Malware', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'JavaScript', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'GitHub', 'firefox', 'Mozilla', 'Research', 'Python', 'Typosquatting']"
no,Remote code execution vulnerability patched in Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter,Fixes have been issued for vulnerable servers,"Multiple vulnerabilities including a remote code execution (RCE) flaw in Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter have been patched.Operations Bridge Reporter (OBR) is an enterprise-grade product based on Vertica and Big Data database analytics, as well as SAP BusinessObjects (BO), Postgres, and other enterprise software. OBR facilitates data collection and aggregation on servers.In a security advisory published on March 2, Agile Information Security researcher Pedro Ribeiro disclosed multiple critical security issues in the software.“OBR requires a lot of network ports to be opened in order to communicate with other hosts as it can be seen in their installation documentation,” Ribeiro noted. “This gives it a huge externally-facing attack surface.”Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsOBR is available for both Windows and Linux machines. In total, five Linux-based command injection bugs impacting login functions were found, all of which can be triggered by unauthenticated attackers. The vulnerabilities are tracked under CVE-2021-22502 and can lead to RCE as root.The AdminService web application contains an SQL injection issue, and while a CVE is yet to be assigned, the vulnerability is considered critical. However, authentication is required in order to exploit the bug.Multiple vulnerabilitiesIn addition, Ribeiro uncovered the use of hard-coded credentials in OBR on Linux. Tracked as CVE-2020-11857, this security flaw was found in the hardcoded credentials for the shrboadmin user at the time SAP BO is installed. The user has full login permissions.An exposed, unauthenticated JMX endpoint also existed, leading to RCE in both Windows and Linux. This vulnerability has been assigned as CVE-2020-11856.Finally, there were incorrect default file permissions in both Windows and Linux builds, tracked as CVE-2020-11855, which could be exploited in privilege escalation attacks – to SYSTEM on Windows, and root in Linux.The vulnerabilities impact OBR version 10.40, and it is suspected earlier versions are also affected.‘Catastrophic’ solutionWhile Micro Focus’ solution may be useful for data analytics, in terms of security, Ribeiro labeled the technology as a “catastrophe”.“[OBR is] a product with a huge attack surface, with terribly insecure defaults and horrible security mistakes,” the researcher added.The vulnerabilities described in this advisory are hilarious, and belong in textbooks, not in enterprise security software.”Ribeiro previously published a separate notice concerning multiple RCE vulnerabilities in Micro Focus Operations Bridge Manager (OBM) in 2020.“This latest one doesn’t have as many vulnerabilities, but in a way it’s far worse since the vulnerabilities are trivial,” Ribeiro told The Daily Swig.“Unauthenticated RCE via direct command injection at login sounds like something one would find in a CTF, yet here it is in an enterprise product created by a multi-billion product company.”READ Vulnerabilities in Smarty PHP template engine renders popular CMS platforms open to abuseMicro Focus has since published advisories informing customers of the security flaws and advises upgrading to the latest build of the software.

no,Open source tool SerialDetector speeds up discovery of .Net deserialization bugs,The tool has already unearthed critical flaws in Microsoft’s Azure DevOps Server,"A team of researchers has developed a new open source tool that can help automate the discovery of dangerous deserialization vulnerabilities in .Net applications.Named SerialDetector, the tool has already netted the researchers bug bounties after helping them to unearth three critical vulnerabilities potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) in Microsoft’s Azure DevOps Server.The researchers, from Sweden’s KTH Royal Institute of Technology, also used the tool to uncover object injection vulnerabilities (OIVs) in six other applications.The tool has been released on GitHub and documented in a paper (PDF) presented at the Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS) Symposium in late February. From deserialization to object injection vulnerabilitiesMany modern programming languages and software frameworks support serialization and deserialization, features that allow inter-process exchange of objects through JSON, XML, binary, and other data formats. For instance, a client-side mobile or desktop application can use the serialization/deserialization features of its underlying framework to send structured objects to a RESTful service in XML format.Serialization simplifies programming and adds flexibility to frameworks, enabling developers to avoid locking their programs into specific types of objects.It does, however, come with security trade-offs. For instance, if the deserialization process is not controlled on the server, it can lead to OIVs, where malicious actors modify a serialized object’s properties before sending it to the server, which then executes arbitrary code during deserialization.RECOMMENDED H2C smuggling named top web hacking technique of 2020The famous Equifax hack that leaked the sensitive financial information of 143 million US customers in 2017 was caused by a deserialization vulnerability in Apache Struts that led to RCE. “Although deserialization vulnerabilities were known for a long time, developers kept using insecure deserializers like JSON libs for many years until these vulnerabilities were exploited,” Mikhail Shcherbakov, PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and lead author of the SerialDetector paper, told The Daily Swig.Shcherbakov describes the process of discovering and patching deserialization as “more of an art than science.”A lack of thorough research and tool development on deserialization and OIVs means most current approaches treat object injection like other types of injection attacks such as SQL and command injection. OIVs are more complex and harder to discover because they are caused by vulnerabilities that exist not only in a target application but also in the underlying framework.A systematic approach Along with his supervisor Musard Balliu, an assistant professor at KTH, Shcherbakov wanted to develop a systematic approach to automating the drudge work involved in discovering OIVs. “From the very beginning, we wanted to develop a tool that would scale to large code bases such as the .NET platform,” Shcherbakov said.Microsoft Azure DevOps, which is built on top of the .Net framework, works with many different data formats and implements complex workflows for input data, so the researchers figured that there was a possibility for insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.Read more of the latest hacking tools newsWith a bit of probing, they found that the DevOps server had several OIVs, including a JSON deserialization bug that emerged in 2017.“At this point, we wondered why JSON and Yaml serialization libraries were considered safe for so long and if/how we could describe and detect the root causes of such vulnerabilities,” Shcherbakov said. “So we started working on SerialDetector and the development of a static analysis tool for .NET code formed its basis.”SerialDetector under the hood“There is no automatic analysis tool for detecting such vulnerabilities in large code bases like .NET framework. SerialDetector is the first step to help framework developers discover OIVs early on,” Shcherbakov said.Existing methods for discovering OIVs rely on knowledge of known vulnerable application APIs, whereas SerialDetector spots new vulnerable patterns. The tool works in two phases: fully automated detection and semi-automated exploitation.During the detection phase, SerialDetector gets a list of .Net assemblies and sensitive sinks, which can be exploited to find OIVs. The tool performs a thorough analysis of the assemblies and automatically generates patterns that could be used for OIV attacks.In the exploitation phase, SerialDetector matches the patterns found in the detection phase with a list of vulnerable gadgets until it finds one or more that can be sent to the server and trigger malicious behavior such as RCE.

yes,"Prime-factor mathematical foundations of RSA cryptography ‘broken’, claims cryptographer",Not so fast on those ‘fast factoring’ boasts,"Claims by a respected German mathematician that the widely used RSA algorithm has been cracked by an advance in cryptoanalysis have received a respectful but cautious response.One-way functions that form the basis of most cryptographic algorithms rely for their security on the difficulty of solving some problems even with access to a powerful computer. The security of RSA, for example, relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.Other types of cryptography use the mathematics of elliptic curves to create a one-way function that is impractical to unravel except through a brute force attack that involves trying every possible key.‘Shortest vector’A paper from mathematician and cryptographer Claus Schnorr claims that prime factorization can be reduced to a much less intractable ‘shortest vector’ problem.The abstract to the paper (PDF), entitled ‘Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms’, claims that this process “destroys the RSA cryptosystem”.If verified, the technique would work even if longer key values were deployed. Increasing the key length is the standard response to making sure algorithms stay ahead of advances in computing technology.If true, a great number of secure systems that rely on RSA would become insecure or at least vulnerable to a previously well defended vector of attack.Catch up with the latest encryption newsThe finding is yet to comprehensively demonstrated much less proved, and cautious interest rather than alarm was the general reaction from cryptoanalysis-savvy social media users.Cryptographer Matthew Green commented on Twitter: “I think the general consensus (paraphrasing a few things people have said) is that this is an exciting approach that unfortunately has no practical evidence of efficacy, and the association of a particular researcher’s name with it should not be viewed as changing any of that.”Professor Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, told The Daily Swig that the paper deserves “careful consideration”.“I don’t believe the paper proves the claims made about RSA but that doesn’t mean the idea is fundamentally wrong,” he added.RELATED KEMTLS: Cloudflare trials new encryption mechanism in anticipation of post-quantum TLS shortcomings",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/prime-factor-mathematical-foundations-of-rsa-cryptography-broken-claims-cryptographer,"['Encryption', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Germany', 'Europe']"

no,More than half of women in infosec are treated unequally to male colleagues due to ‘blatant sexism’ in the workplace – report,Study finds unconscious bias and ‘micro-aggressions’ are holding female security industry workers back,"Women in information security face ongoing sexism and discrimination, and more than half believe it will be 10 years or more before they are treated equally to their male colleagues.This is according to new research about the issues women face in the infosec industry, released ahead of International Women’s Day 2021 (March 8).The Chartered Institute of Information Security (CIISec) found that 57% of female cybersecurity professionals felt they were not treated the same as their male colleagues. A further one in five respondents believe that true equality may never happen.The study found that half of women in the sector have “experienced or observed” blatant sexism, whilst 46% said they were paid less than their male colleagues.Half of the women polled have held positions where they were the only female in their organization, and 48% said that they felt they worked in an unwelcoming “boys’ club”.A further 42% felt they had been denied promotion due to their gender.Call for change: Nina Paine (left), head of cyber stakeholder and government engagement at Standard Chartered, and Amanda Finch, CEO of CIISecHeld backThe women polled in the study highlighted a perceived lack of role models, insufficient training and progression, and poor work-life balance as key issues that are holding women back in the cybersecurity workspace.According to Amanda Finch, CEO of CIISec, the industry needs to work harder to eliminate discrimination.“If 47% of women have seen blatant sexism, that is not a great advert for people coming in,” Finch told The Daily Swig.“Women are saying they lack confidence. [And] there is still the perception that the industry is a boys’ club.”READ Infosec pro Vandana Verma on improving diversity and helping to grow the Indian security communityFinch argues that attitudes towards women working in the cybersecurity industry – one that is dominated by men – also need to change.“We need to look at areas like unconscious bias and micro-discrimination,” she said.She added that more senior security industry professionals might themselves not receive the training and support to make them effective managers who can counter discrimination.Necessary stepsFinch argued that initiatives to encourage more girls and young women to consider careers in cybersecurity are delivering results.But she warns that the industry needs to do more. This could include more diverse recruitment, as well as better career paths, support, and training for those already working in the sector.“Doing this will help make a real difference in encouraging women into the industry,” she said.“The fact that the industry continues to face a skill shortage makes it alarming that the industry is struggling to attract and retain diverse talent,” said Nina Paine, global head of cyber stakeholder and government engagement at Standard Chartered, a financial services firm.“It is clear that there is still work to be done by leaders to make inclusion and diversity a natural given within organizational cultures – and this means embracing individuals from a variety of backgrounds.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE ‘In security, every problem is different’ – Offensive Security’s Ning Wang on training the next generation of infosec pros",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/more-than-half-of-women-in-infosec-are-treated-unequally-to-male-colleagues-due-to-blatant-sexism-in-the-workplace-report,"['Industry', 'News', 'Research', 'Organizations']"
no,Dispute rages over ModSecurity 3 WAF ‘bypass risk’,"A security researcher went public with his concerns, but ModSec maintainers insist that default WAF settings are safe","ModSecurity 3 web application firewall (WAF) installations configured to disable Request Body Access can be bypassed, security researchers warn.The purported issue in ModSecurity rule sets is restricted to ModSecurity 3 (not the earlier ModSecurity 2 version of the product) and does not affect WAF admins who give the engine access to the request body.However, for those affected the risk is substantial, according to Christian Folini, a Swiss security researcher and author.Ervin Hegedüs, the security researcher who identified the problem, reported the issue on the ModSecurity team on December 2.Despite more than three months of discussion, the issue remains unresolved – an unsatisfactory state of affairs that prompted Folini to go public with his concerns through a technical blog post earlier this week.Trustwave, the firm behind ModSecurity, denied that there was a vulnerability, describing the issue as a risk inherent only to a particular advanced configuration setting.WAF timeModSecurity is a popular open source web application firewall (WAF) that’s designed to work through the application of pre-set rules. The technology is often paired with the Nginx web server.Security administrators can either create their own custom rules or deploy existing libraries, such as those from the free-to-install OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) project.Folini, CRS project co-lead, told The Daily Swig: “If you run CRS or one the known commercial ModSecurity rule sets on ModSecurity 3 and you disable Request Body Access for the WAF, then you have configured a complete WAF bypass.??“This is because skipping request body access is implemented as skipping the?request body phase (= phase 2) of rule processing in ModSecurity 3.”RELATED ModSecurity maintainers contest denial-of-service vulnerability claimsThe ModSecurity WAF engine is maintained by security vendor Trustwave.In response to queries from The Daily Swig, Trustwave offered a statement denying there was any problem with its technology:The issue outlined in the Core Rule Set blog post is not a vulnerability. It references an advanced configuration setting, which by default is on and must be disabled to create the behavior mentioned in the blog.This setting can be used to disable a significant portion of the ModSecurity workflow and should only be used by experienced users, as indicated in the documentation.This specific issue has been discussed at length in the ModSecurity community forums, and as a result, code changes have been developed to make it clearer that disabling these default settings can have undesired results. These code changes will be part of version 3.1 of ModSecurity, which will be available after testing of the complete release by the open-source community has been finalized.In response to CVE-2020-15598, we released the following blog post back in September 2020: ModSecurity, Regular Expressions and Disputed CVE-2020-15598Folini – who confirmed his concerns stand despite Trustwave’s denial of any problem – explained that the issue is difficult to defend against in the absence of a comprehensive fix from ModSecurity/Trustwave.“The ModSecurity developers have not provided a fix for this problem, despite? being informed about it on December 2,” according to Folini.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsFolini reckons that less than a fifth of all global ModSecurity installations have been set up with this ‘vulnerable’ configuration.Administrators might disable Request Body Access for “performance reasons at times (trading security for performance, while retaining some security), or they are only interested in certain types of rules”.Body heatThe security researchers went on to suggest possible workarounds to address the configuration-dependent security issue in ModSecurity 3.“Enabling Request Body Access is the best approach,” Folini said. “Yet people usually disable it for a reason, so this might not be viable.”Folini continued: “Shifting as many rules from phase 2 to phase 1 is another alternative. We tried to do this for CRS, planning to release that as v 3.3.1, yet we had to give up that plan due to the many different negative side effects it provoked and more ModSecurity3 bugs that surfaced along the way.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/dispute-rages-over-modsecurity-3-waf-bypass-risk,"['Network', 'Security', 'WAF', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Switzerland', 'Europe', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Research']"
no,Vulnerabilities in Smarty PHP template engine renders popular CMS platforms open to abuse,"Now-patched exploits surface for Tiki Wiki CMS and CMS Made Simple, but researchers warn that many other applications may be vulnerable","Vulnerabilities in the Smarty PHP template engine could be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE) in third-party applications, a security researcher has warned.Two separate sandbox escape vulnerabilities in the open source engine can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on dependent software, a blog post reveals.Smarty, a template engine for PHP, enables the separation of web app presentation code – namely HTML and CSS – from application logic.Smarty is used by a number of third-party applications, meaning that vulnerabilities in the template engine could leave these platforms open to exploitation. However, only applications that allow users to modify Smarty templates are affected. Applications who only use static templates are safe from these exploits.Source Incite researchers detailed how they were able to achieve RCE in two CMS applications, Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware and CMS Made Simple, by combining the bugs with other existing software vulnerabilities.CMS Made SimpleA vulnerability (CVE-2019-9053), in CMS Made Simple, first reported by Daniele Scanu, allows an unauthenticated user to launch an SQL injection attack to bypass authentication and reset the administrator password.As discovered by Source Incite researcher Steven Seeley, a flaw in Smarty (CVE-2021-26120), allows an authenticated user with ‘designer’ permissions to escape the Smarty sandbox by leveraging the function 'name' property as part of a server-side template injection (SSTI) attack.Combined, the two vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute remote code execution on the CMS Made Simple application.A proof of concept from Seeley resets the password for user_id 1 “which is probably the administrator”, they wrote.However, Seeley warns: “The administrator’s password will be reset to the administrator’s username. Use at your own risk.”Tiki Wiki CMSA vulnerability in Tiki Wiki CMS (CVE-2020-15906), first reported by Maximilian Barz, allows a user to bypass authentication by brute-forcing the admin account until it is locked after 50 attempts.The password then resets and a user can login with a blank password.BACKGROUND Tiki Wiki authentication bypass flaw gives attackers full control of websites, intranetsAlthough this bug has been patched, a second vulnerability in Smarty (CVE-2021-26119) enables an administrator to trigger server-side template injection and gain remote code execution by leveraging the'template_object'property.A proof of concept from Seeley warns that this exploit will lock the administrator out of their account.Sandbox escaperSeeley, who discovered the two bugs in Smarty, told The Daily Swig: “During the analysis of third-party applications that utilize the Smarty template engine, it was often found that it was configured in an insecure way and didn’t even use the sandbox feature, thus allowing trivial remote code execution to occur.”He was able to carry out the attacks on the two CMS platforms, but warned: “Many more applications are impacted in various ways.The Tiki Wiki and CMS Made Simple vulnerabilities have been patched, and Smarty users should ensure they are updated. The issues affect versions 3.1.38 and below.More details and a proof of concept can be found in this blog post.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Research: How JSON parsers can create security risks when it comes to interoperability",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerabilities-in-smarty-php-template-engine-renders-cms-platforms-open-to-abuse,"['Vulnerabilities', 'RCE', 'SSTI', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'PHP', 'Secure', 'Development', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'Research']"
no,Research: How JSON parsers can create security risks when it comes to interoperability,"Open-ended specifications are partly to blame, researcher suggests","Supposedly benign behaviors exhibited by JSON parsers can introduce a variety of security risks arising from how data is interpreted across multiple parsers, security researchers have found.Of 49 JSON parsers road-tested by researchers from Bishop Fox, “each language had at least one parser that exhibited a form of potentially risky interoperability behavior”, said Jake Miller, lead researcher at the offensive security outfit, in a technical write-up.The researchers presented attack scenarios, supported by Docker Compose labs, exploiting inconsistent duplicate key precedence, key collision through character truncation and comments, JSON serialization quirks, float and integer representation, and permissive parsing.“Other than segmentation faults, these behaviors are harmless in the context of a single parser, which prevents them from [being] classified as vulnerabilities for a particular parser,” said Miller.Where multiple parsers are involved, however, they can lead to business logic, injection, and type juggling vulnerabilities, among other issues.“Parsers provided by standard libraries tended to be the most compliant, but they often lacked speed, which is of increasing importance in microservice architectures,” said Miller. “This has prompted developers to choose more performant, third-party parsers.”Inter(in)operable misbehaviorHowever, even compliance with standards does not entirely preclude problems, with Miller concluding that inconsistent implementations are fueled by ambiguous or inconsistent specifications, as well as the growing complexity of interoperability in modern, multi-language microservice architectures.Applications within these architectures “often rely on several separate JSON parsing implementations, each of which has its own quirks”, he says.READ MORE HTTP request smuggling: HTTP/2 opens a new attack tunnelHe also cites HTTP request smuggling as an example of how “discrepancies across parsers combined with multi-stage request processing can introduce serious vulnerabilities”.‘Open-ended’ specs“Even in the best-case implementation” of parsers generally, “there are inevitably minor, unintentional deviations from specifications”.But JSON specifications themselves are divergent, said Miller, citing IETF JSON RFC (8259 and prior), ECMAScript Standard, JSON5, and HJSON.Even the official JSON RFC guidance is “open-ended” for “a few topics, such as how to handle duplicate keys and represent numbers”, he notes. “Although this guidance is followed by disclaimers about interoperability, most users of JSON parsers aren’t aware of these caveats.”Read more of the latest secure development newsMiller suspects the ambiguity is a deliberate attempt “not to break backwards compatibility with pre-specification JSON parsers, including the original JavaScript implementation”.If true, this is misconceived, he argues.“Restricting behavior to deterministic outcomes not only improves interoperability but also makes it easier to report bugs and improve our software,” the researcher suggests.“Breaking by defining previously undefined behavior may cause pushback. But in the modern context of microservice architectures, where interoperability becomes increasingly complex, it may be a worthwhile choice.”Mitigations for all partiesMiller recommends that parser maintainers mitigate risks by generating fatal parse errors on duplicate keys, and eschewing character truncation in favor of replacing invalid unicode with placeholder characters, among other things.These “nuanced attacks” are hard to detect externally, so infosec professionals with access to source code should “look for parsers with known quirks”, and “try duplicating keys and using the suggestions in the labs README to try to induce collisions”.He also says JSON Schema may help mitigate parsing risks like type checking and constraining the range of allowed integers, but are blind to inconsistent parsing.Security software engineer Claudio Salazar has responded to the research with his own secure development advice.“Test the corner cases” among “JSON libraries used on your stack” then choose libraries that share behaviors, “use schema validation” and “ share this validation definition among microservices if they are receiving data independently”, and use a comprehensive test suite, which if “a developer wants to use another JSON library”, will “warn you about some differences in the parsing logic that could affect your application security”, he said in a blog post.Underrated threat“The simplicity of JSON is often taken for granted”, says Miller. “We don’t usually consider JSON parsing as part of our threat model.”However, the researcher told The Daily Swig that “when inconsistent implementations begin to break our assumptions, our ability to safely validate business logic breaks along with it. Vulnerabilities like this highlight the importance of research at lower levels of request processing that are often abstracted to application developers.”RECOMMENDED H2C smuggling named top web hacking technique of 2020",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/research-how-json-parsers-can-create-security-risks-when-it-comes-to-interoperability,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Research', 'Compliance', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Hacking', 'Techniques']"
no,WordPress 5.7 offers ‘one-click’ HTTP to HTTPS site upgrade feature,Pain relief for mixed-content headaches goes mainstream next week,"An upcoming upgrade to WordPress will make it much easier for website owners to upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS.WordPress 5.7 – currently available as a beta release and due to go mainstream on March 9 – promises to make the formerly tricky business of migration to a secure instance of the content management system (CMS) a one-step process, as the WordPress core development team explains:Switching a WordPress site from HTTP to HTTPS has proven to be a pain for all involved. While on the surface, the site address and WordPress address have to be updated, content with embedded HTTP URLs remains unchanged in the database.With this release, migrating a site to HTTPS is now a one-click interaction. URLs in the database are automatically replaced when the Site and WordPress Address are both using HTTPS. Also, Site Health now includes an HTTPS status check.HTTPS everywhereWordPress omits figures on the number of websites that serve content over HTTP rather than the more secure HTTPS protocol on its official statistics page.According to httparchive.org, 89.3% of URLs crawled use HTTPS, a figure some suggest might be indicative of the state of deployment of secure site instances of WordPress, the most widely used CMS framework on the web.However, WordPress expert Tim Nash cautioned that “getting reliable stats is hard”, adding that the httparchive figure “ seems too high” even though installing HTTPS installs of WordPress is becoming easier.“With most major hosts supporting one click or zero click HTTPS, and also one or zero click WordPress install, the trend for new sites is overwhelmingly over HTTPS,” he explained. “Older sites also benefit [from the fact] that for most hosts installing HTTPS is becoming significantly easier.“It's quite difficult to run a site over HTTP only these days and get traffic [because] browsers are being proactive about warning about sites running HTTP only,” he added.The new feature in WordPress 5.7 is designed to “build on the work done by hosting companies and browsers and to try and reduce the amount of mixed protocol messages, by proactively changing URLs in the database that are not relative”, according to Nash.Ryan Dewhurst, founder and CEO of WPScan, said that WordPress has been gradually pushing users towards HTTPS for nearly two years.Catch up on more of the latest WordPress security news“Since WordPress 5.1 (February 2019), WordPress has included a new Site Health page in the admin section,” Dewhurst explained.“This page includes some basic security checks, including warning the user if they are not using HTTPS.”Dewhurst added that the biggest challenge for WordPress administrators in migrating to HTTPS from HTTP are the hardcoded URLs used in pages, posts, and the theme itself.“This leads to mixed content issues, where the page is loaded over HTTPS but includes HTTP content,” he said.WordPress 5.7 security enhancementsAccording to the release notes, WordPress 5.7 helps the user overcome any potential HTTPS upgrade challenges by automatically updating all URLs stored in the CMS database.Improvements in the editor also feature in forthcoming release, which will be the first major upgrade to the platform in 2021.Dewhurst concluded: “WordPress 5.7 will also include updates to the jQuery JavaScript library, which has lagged behind in the past, leaving WordPress using older versions, or back ported versions.”WordPress 5.7 also brings in a new password reset button.“The new interface streamlines this process [that will] allow site admins to quickly reset and automatically start the reset password process for an end user,” Nash told The Daily Swig.One of the biggest changes that will ""impact security in years to come"" is the introduction of script attribute functions, according to Nash, a WordPress security consultant at timnash.co.uk.“This will allow standardisation of the way inline JavaScript and CSS is generated on the site,” he explained. “This might not sound particularly interesting, but it will allow the passing of, for example, a nonce to all inline CSS correctly generated.“Ultimately this work is designed to allow Content Security Policies in the wp-admin area without having to resort to unsafe-inline,” Nash concluded.RELATED WordPress 5.6 lands with new auto-update UI, Site Health enhancements",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/wordpress-5-7-offers-one-click-http-to-https-site-upgrade-feature,"['WordPress', 'Encryption', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Privacy', 'MitM', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Browsers', 'JavaScript']"

no,Bug Bounty Radar // The latest bug bounty programs for March 2021,New web targets for the discerning hacker,"Welcome to the first Bug Bounty Radar of 2021, back with a bang after a short hiatus. As you’ll see, we’ve introduced a smart new design – but rest assured, you’ll still find the same mix of the latest bug bounty news, programs, and vulnerability write-ups.We kicked off the year with an interview with Swiss bounty hunter ‘Xel’ – AKA Raphaël Arrouas – who shared the secrets of his success, along with tips for those just starting out.“Focusing on impact rather than quantity allows me to dedicate more time to researching vulnerabilities in depth and learn something in the process,” he says. “And it is worthwhile considering the payout scales, which usually greatly favor high and critical impact vulnerabilities.”Elsewhere, bug hunter Alex Birsan netted $130,000 by showing how a novel supply chain attack allowed him to hack into systems belonging to Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, and other major tech companies.By exploiting a vulnerability dubbed ‘dependency confusion’, he was able to execute malware within the companies’ networks by overriding privately-used dependency packages with malicious, public packages with the same name.And precisely this supply chain attack has already been seen in the wild. A developer at automated software testing specialist Qentinel reported the failure of a build pipeline when fetching internal libraries and traced the problem to suspicious packages in the Python Package Index repository. The problem was fixed a day later.You’ll find more information on supply chain attacks in our latest deep dive on the issue, including prevention and mitigation advice.In military news, the German armed forces – or ‘Bundeswehr’ – says it’s received more than 60 valid reports since the start of its vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) three months ago. They included cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, misconfiguration, data leakage, and open redirect bugs.Meanwhile, DARPA – the US military’s technology R&D agency – has given an update on its own bug bounty program. The agency says it’s exposed 10 vulnerabilities, seven critical and three high, with four already patched and the others soon to be resolved.And finally, for those who missed it, HTTP/2 (H2C) cleartext smuggling has been voted the best web hacking technique of 2020.“Conceptually similar” to last year’s WebSocket smuggling, “request tunnelling exploitation is an emerging art so this one may be a slow burn, but we anticipate some serious carnage in future”, said James Kettle, head of research at PortSwigger Web Security.It’ll be interesting to see which of these techniques becomes the bug hunters’ favorite in 2021.The latest bug bounty programs for March 2021The past month saw the arrival of several new bug bounty programs.

no,Suspicious finds: Researcher discovers Go typosquatting package that relays system information to Chinese tech firm,One of several dubious repositories flagged by custom-built tool,"UPDATED A Go package that relays system information to a Chinese IP address was one of several suspicious repositories uncovered during an investigation into typosquatting in the Go ecosystem.Using a tool he built for the research project, GitLab security engineer Michael Henriksen scanned all 731 GitHub and GitLab hosted packages from the Go Module Index, surfacing seven dubious packages in all.Typosquatting refers to malicious packages with near-identical names to those of legitimate packages, uploaded to repositories in the hope that developers will mistype the package name and inadvertently download the rogue version.BACKGROUND Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowHenriksen’s tool, ‘Pkgtwist’, scours Golang package import paths for various permutations of every package owner’s username, and when a match is found cross-references their package names.Using typogenerater, he configured the tool to find examples of typosquatting by omission (for example stretchr becomes strechr), repetition (gobuffalo/gobuffallo), bitsquatting (stretchr/strftchr), and transposition (stretchr/strethcr).All systems (info) GoOne of two packages deemed to warrant further investigation purported to be the GitHub ‘cli’ repository that is widely used for building CLI (command-line interface) Go projects.The package’s penultimate commit “introduces a highly suspicious init function” that extracts “hostname, operating system, and architecture of all the machines using their version of urfave/cli”, said Henriksen in a blog post.The function “then calls out to the IP address 122.51.124.140 belonging to the Chinese company Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems via HTTP with the system information added as URL parameters”.While this doesn’t give them system access, the author – ‘utfave’, a near-copy of legitimate cli author ‘urfave’ – “can quickly change this code to call back with a reverse shell if they identify a system to be valuable or interesting”, said the researcher.“I reported this repository to GitHub and hope to see it taken down in the near future,” he added.He urged users of cli and GitHub logging package ‘logrus’, which was imitated by the other imposter package of particular concern, to make sure their projects were not using the typosquatting versions.He also said he would monitor the other five flagged packages “as they could in theory become malicious at any time”.Automation drawback“The fact that developers have to explicitly write out which module to import in every file where they want to use an external package makes it less likely that any confusion can happen,” Henriksen told The Daily Swig. This also means the novel dependency confusion attack vector that surfaced in the wild recently poses no credible threat to the Go ecosystem, he points out.However, “code editor automation could increase the chances of an evil dependency living for a longer time in a Go project because a developer would typically write the import manually once, and then the editor takes over and adds the import automatically to other files from then on. “So if the developer is so unfortunate to mistype the package import path on the first import, they might not notice it for a while since they won't be importing it manually anymore in other files. The editor will just happily add the malicious import for them.”All an attacker has to do to typosquat on the host domain is register “a common typo of github.com” or, simpler still, “register a new user on GitHub, or any other open package host, with a common typo of the package owner’s username”.Read more of the latest open source software security newsHenriksen said programming languages such as NPM for JavaScript, Rubygems for Ruby, and PyPI for Python “have been plagued for years” by typosquatting attacks, but intimated that the Golang ecosystem’s vulnerability was comparatively under-researched.Surprised that his extensive (but non-exhaustive) trawl had yielded only seven suspicious packages, the researcher declared himself “happy to see that the Go ecosystem isn’t completely infested (yet)”.‘Lucrative’ targetThat's apparently less true of malware strains, however, whose prevalence in Golang has soared by 2,000% in the last four years, according to a report published last week by cybersecurity firm Intezer.Natalie Page, threat intelligence analyst at Talion, thinks the comparative rarity of Go code makes it “an attractive and lucrative” target.“Currently Golang produce’s a much lower detection rate against security software when compared with popular malware code languages such as C & Python, C++,” she says.Go is also attractive because of the “ease at which the same code can be utilised across multiple platforms for targeting against Windows, Mac, and Linux”, she adds.“It is particularly concerning to see sophisticated threat groups such as Fancy Bear, adopting this tactic to create Golang versions of their already extremely successful tooling such as Zebrocy.”This article was updated with comments from Michael Henriksen on March 1.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/suspicious-finds-researcher-discovers-go-typosquatting-package-that-relays-system-information-to-chinese-tech-firm,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Windows', 'Vulnerabilities', 'GitHub', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Research', 'Asia', 'China', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Python', 'Typosquatting']"
no,Data analytics agency Polecat held to ransom after server exposed 30TB of records,Researchers say ‘billions’ of records were leaked before cyber-attackers took advantage,"An unsecured server belonging to a data analytics company exposed an estimated 30TB of business records online, resulting in the firm being held to ransom.Polecat is a UK-based agency that offers “a combination of advanced data analytics and human expertise, [to help] the world’s largest organizations achieve reputation, risk, and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) management success”.On October 29, 2020, the Wizcase CyberResearch Team, led by Ata Hakcil, discovered that an Elasticsearch server owned by Polecat was exposing roughly 30TB of data on the web without any authentication required to access records, or any form of encryption in place.Wizcase found records dating back to 2007, including employee usernames and hashed passwords, over 6.5 billion tweets, social media records, and over one billion posts gathered from different blogs and websites.Chase Williams of the company's cyber research team detailed his findings in a blog post published today (March 1).Meow attackThe public information gathered by Polecat is harvested on a daily basis and tends to relate to subjects such as Covid-19, firearms, politicians, racism, and healthcare.Polecat was notified of the data exposure by Wizcase on October 30 and November 1. However, it can take mere moments for an open server or bucket to be detected and abused by threat actors – and this happened a day after the researcher’s discovery.On October 30, a Meow attack was launched against the database. Meow attacks replace database indexes with the suffix ‘gg-meow’, leading to the destruction of swathes of data.Wizcase says that approximately half of the firm’s records were wiped, and then in a second wave a further few terabytes of information were deleted.At this point, roughly 4TB remained in the server. Most of these records were then destroyed and a ransom note was spotted by the researchers that demanded 0.04 Bitcoin (BTC) – roughly $550 at the time – in return for the files’ recovery.Read more of the latest news about cyber-attacks“It’s important to note that these types of scams/ransoms are usually automated and sent to many open databases,” Wizcase noted.While the information exposed was public, it could have been downloaded for sale to competitors, and could therefore directly impact Polecat’s business.Polecat responded to Wizcase’s report on November 2, and secured the server on the same day.The Daily Swig has reached out to Polecat and will update when we hear back.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Sketchy Firefox browser extension used to spy on Tibetans’ email accounts",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/data-analytics-agency-polecat-held-to-ransom-after-server-exposed-30tb-of-records,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Database', 'Security', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Ransomware', 'Malware', 'Social', 'Media', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Encryption', 'Passwords', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Organizations', 'Research']"
no,Sketchy Firefox browser extension used to spy on Tibetans’ email accounts,"‘Malicious browser plugins aren’t new, but they are an often-forgotten attack surface in many enterprises’","Security researchers from Proofpoint have intercepted a sneaky, albeit low-volume phishing campaign designed to plant malware on the systems of Tibetan organizations via a malicious Firefox browser extension.Targets of the campaign typically receive a fraudulent email inviting them view video content of a malicious site that poses as YouTube. An ‘Adobe Flash’ download is supposedly needed to view this content.In reality, users who install this browser add-on will find their systems infected with a malicious Mozilla Firefox browser extension, dubbed ‘FriarFox’, as explained in a technical blog post by Proofpoint.Chinese whispersThe dodgy phishing email intercepted by Proofpoint posed as a message from the “Tibetan Women’s Association” and utilized the email subject “Inside Tibet and from the Tibetan exile community”.The attack, geared towards gaining access to the Gmail accounts of Tibetans and Tibetan organizations worldwide, has been linked to APT TA413, a threat group that’s aligned with the Chinese Communist Party’s state interests, according to Proofpoint.The same group was seen slinging the Scanbox and Sepulcher malware to Tibetan organizations earlier this year.The malicious ‘FriarFox’ browser extension was pushed onto users’ browsers via phishingWhile this particular campaign is targeted at the Tibetan community, APT TA413 has been known to take aim at other political targets.Last year, Proofpoint uncovered that the same group targeted European politicians with the likely aim of stealing state secrets and economic data.Copycat campaignsProofpoint warns that technique might easily be adopted by other malicious hacking groups.Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, said: “Malicious browser plugins aren’t new, but they are an often-forgotten attack surface in many enterprises, and it was surprising to see an APT actor aligned with the Chinese state use this method.“While we saw APT TA413 use this new tool to access Gmail accounts and spy on vulnerable Tibetan dissident populations – it’s very possible that additional threat actors could use this technique to target both public and private sector organisations worldwide,” he added.Read more of the latest cyber-attack news from around the worldDeGrippo added: “The complex delivery method of the tool, which we call the ‘FriarFox’ browser extension, grants this APT actor near total access to the Gmail accounts of their victims, which is especially troubling as email accounts really are among the highest value assets when it comes to human intelligence.”Access to email accounts gives hackers the ability to reset a victim’s other online accounts.Threat actors can also use compromised email accounts to send email from that account using the victim’s contact list, a ready mechanism to generate convincing follow-up phishing messages or to make it more likely that recipients will open malware-laden message attachments.RECOMMENDED VMware fixes RCE bug – 6,000-plus servers potentially at risk as attackers probe systems",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/sketchy-firefox-browser-extension-used-to-spy-on-tibetans-email-accounts,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'YouTube', 'Malware', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Email', 'Security', 'Browsers', 'firefox', 'Mozilla', 'China', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Google', 'Asia']"
no,"VMware fixes vCenter RCE bug – 6,000-plus servers potentially at risk as attackers probe systems",Public disclosure brought forward after exploits surface online,"UPDATED VMware has patched a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in its vCenter server management software that could allow hackers to take over servers and gain access to sensitive data.According to Positive Technologies, which also discovered a less serious server-side request forgery (SSRF) flaw, more than 6,000 VMware vCenter deployments could be vulnerable to the unauthenticated RCE exploit, with a quarter of these located in the US.The firm brought forward disclosure of its findings after a proof-of-concept surfaced online and attackers began attempting exploitation.The main threat, says Positive Technologies, comes from insiders who penetrate the network perimeter using methods such as social engineering or exploiting web vulnerabilities, or who have access to the internal network using previously installed backdoors.The RCE flaw, which is tracked as CVE-2021-21972 and has a CVSS score of 9.8, allows an unauthenticated user to send a specially crafted request, which opens the door for the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.Attackers can then, says the company, move through the corporate network and gain access to data such as information about virtual machines and system users.Critical, but not likely catastrophic“By exploiting this flaw, a criminal could compromise a VMware hypervisor, which would allow access to critical internal infrastructure servers and business systems, such as domain controllers, Citrix servers, and servers of financial accounting systems, et cetera,” Mikhail Klyuchnikov, senior web application security researcher at Positive Technologies, tells The Daily Swig.“It’s also possible for attackers to compromise the PCI DSS segment, opening up an opportunity to manage ATM network control servers or bank processing servers.“Nevertheless, in the overwhelming majority of cases, vCenter is installed within an organization, and only a small, insignificant part of the total volume of vCenter installations are on the perimeter,” says Klyuchnikov.“So although the vulnerability is critical, and the exploit appeared so early, it will not lead to a catastrophe.”Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsPositive Technologies originally held off on publishing full details of the vulnerability. However, the proof of concept was published by a Chinese security researcher, who described step by step how to reproduce it.The security company then found fully-fledged working exploits in two repositories.At this point, malicious hackers piled in to mass-scan and compromise systems, prompting Positive Technologies to publish its own findings.Server-side security holesThe second, SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2021-21973), which has a CVSS score of 5.3, allows unauthorized users to send requests as the targeted server, creating an opportunity for a hacker to develop further attacks.Attackers could then scan the company's internal network and obtain information about the open ports of various services.“These vulnerabilities are very serious. VMware holds up to 80% of the virtual machine market. Any companies using the VMware vCenter Server to manage their vSphere installations could become possible victims,” says Klyuchnikov.“Our threat intelligence suggests there are over 6,000 VMware vCenter devices worldwide that are accessible from the internet and contain the most critical of the two vulnerabilities.”VMware was alerted to the flaws on October 2, 2020, and released a patch addressing the flaws on February 23.Positive Technologies, which disclosed its findings on February 24, also recommends removing any vCenter Server interfaces from the network perimeter and allocating them to a separate VLAN with a limited access list within the internal network instead.“In line with VMware's commitment to responsible disclosure, we issued a public security advisory with a fix and workaround for a security issue that was privately reported to us in order to help our customers stay safe,” a spokesperson for VMware told The Daily Swig.“As a matter of best practice, VMware always encourages all customers to apply the latest product updates, security patches and mitigations made available for their specific environment and deploy our products in a security hardened configuration.”This article was updated with comments from VMware on March 1.RECOMMENDED H2C smuggling named top web hacking technique of 2020",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vmware-fixes-vcenter-rce-bug-6-000-plus-servers-potentially-at-risk-as-attackers-probe-systems,"['RCE', 'Network', 'Security', 'Research', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Cryptojacking', 'SSRF', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'Techniques']"
no,"Cybersecurity conferences 2021: A schedule of virtual, and potentially in-person or ‘hybrid’, events",Your one-stop reference for infosec events announced for 2021 so far,"While Covid-19 has, for now, put an end to in-person industry conferences in many countries, the infosec events calendar has nevertheless remained impressively busy.While some organizers chose to cancel their 2020 events, especially at the pandemic’s outset – starting with Mobile World Conference (MWC) last February – most transformed them into all-virtual affairs instead.In-person, indoor events will surely be the among the last activities to return to normal once Covid response-mandated restrictions across many countries are eased. But with vaccines now being rolled out worldwide, many infosec events scheduled for the second half of 2021 were tentatively planned, and have been held, as in-person conferences.Many have so far persisted with a virtual model or compromised with a hybrid format – and there may be no going back to the former status quo.“We have realized that a significant element of business can progress without the need to incur extensive costs associated with face to face engagement – not only in the form of travel and accommodation, but also those costs associated with hours lost in travel time,” Camilla Currin, cybersecurity consultant at infosec firm Trend Micro, told The Daily Swig.“Will we start slipping back into that 24/7 business lifestyle or will we continue to drive the online, connected world, where we attend streamed conferences and events?“Will the developers of collaboration tools get us to a place where the functionality of these tools provide richer experiences to what we used to experience in person? Only time will tell.”The infosec calendar is once again looking busy and – for now – largely virtualIt remains to be seen how many formerly in-person events persist with the online model, permanently adopt a hybrid model where those who can’t attend can instead stream presentations (AUSCert2021, for instance, is taking this approach), or dismiss the hybrid option for fear that it will cannibalize the in-person conference.Most will no doubt be keen to restore the many revenue streams that were lost in the virtual migration that took place last year.In the meantime, the infosec calendar, which we’ve set out below, is once again looking busy and a mixture of formats are on offer.

no,Say my CNAME: Rise of sneaky adtech tactic poses threat to web security and privacy,Whack-a-mole game in play between trackers and ad blockers,"Websites are making heavier use of a technology called CNAME tracking to get around ad blockers on the web – much to the detriment of both privacy and security on the web, a new study warns.A group of computer scientists from KU Leuven in Belgium and an independent researcher, who was affiliated with the European data protection regulator, reports that this this tracking scheme is rapidly gaining traction, especially among high-traffic websites.Trackers build behavioral-based user profiles through intrusive data collection in order to make money by serving ads linked to surfers’ browsing history.More and more mores users have turned to anti-tracking tools to preserve their privacy but the advertising technology (ad tech) industry has responded by turning to CNAME tracking, a stealthier and, the researchers argue, more damaging form of the technology.Tom Van Goethem, one of the researchers, told The Daily Swig that the technology has a negative impact on the security of publishers’ sites.“There are several issues there that are intrinsic to CNAME-based tracking: authentication cookies may flow to the tracker (this unnecessarily increases the attack surface),” Van Goethem explained. “Trackers also add code to the website; if this contains security flaws, it also impacts the website itself.”The potential danger of this is increased by the fact that the tracker runs on a subdomain of the publisher (same-site), Van Goethem added.Van Goethem explained: “One of the security issues we discovered introduces a cross-site scripting vulnerability in all the websites that use this tracker. Despite several attempts to contact the tracker, the issue has not been mitigated and puts hundreds of websites (and their users) at risk.”A blog post by Lukasz Olejnik, another researcher involved in the intensive study, carried out over more than a year, highlights another risk:The use of the CNAME cloaking technique leads to massive cookie leaks. In 95% of cases of websites using this technique, we found cookies leaking to external tracker servers in an unsanctioned manner, invisible to the user.In some cases, we confirm that the leaked cookies contain private/sensitive data. All these likely trigger the violation of data protection regimes such as the GDPR, or maybe even the CCPA.CNAME of the game‘CNAME cloaking’ disguises third-party trackers as first-party trackers as a tactic to bypass interdiction by ad blockers.The approach relies on assigning a subdomain for data collection and tracking, and linking it to an external server with the CNAME DNS record.A Canonical Name (CNAME) record maps domain name connections so that multiple services, such as an FTP server and web server running on different ports, can run from a single IP address.Security decimatedThe researchers – Yana Dimova, Gunes Acar, and Wouter Joosen as well as Olejnik and Van Goethem – found that almost one in 10 (9.98%) of the top 10,000 websites were running CNAME tracking to serve ads.Use of this method is rising (up 21% over the past 22 months), according to Olejnik. At least 13 adtech providers are actively deploying the technique.“We detect 13 providers of such tracking ‘services’ on 10,474 websites,” Olejnik writes. “This scheme leads to data leaks on 95% of the websites employing it. Such data leaks sometimes involve unambiguously private data.”The researchers carried out an evaluation of an anti-tracking evasion scheme that leverages CNAME records to include tracker resources in a same-site context, effectively bypassing anti-tracking measures that use fixed, hostname-based block lists.RECOMMENDED H2C smuggling named top web hacking technique of 2020To establish whether CNAME-based trackers were used to replace third-party tracking, the team ran an experiment where they compared the number of third-party trackers detected in the six-month period before they included a CNAME-based tracker with the figure for the subsequent six months.“Surprisingly we found that there was almost no change in the number of third-party trackers per site (on average around 22!),” Van Goethem reports. “Furthermore, there is one tracker that only switches to CNAME-based tracking when they detect the user is visiting the site with Safari (which blocks third-party tracking by default).”“These findings indicate that CNAME-based tracking is used to gain insights in the visitors that already make use of anti-tracking mechanisms,” he added.What’s in a CNAME?Users who wish to block CNAME-based tracking can make use of anti-tracking tools that implemented defences for it.There are also mechanisms that block it at the DNS level, such as NextDNS, AdGuard, and Pi-hole. Browser-level defences such as uBlock Origin on Firefox, Brave, and Safari may also be an option.“The Safari defenses against CNAME-based tracking were introduced shortly after we submitted our paper, so we haven't had the chance yet to thoroughly evaluate this specific defense, but we are happy to see that more and more efforts are being made to curb this tracking method that's on the rise.”Some of those deploying CNAME technique are targeting some specifically targeting surfers that use Apple Safari, the study discovered.Read more of the latest data privacy newsA paper on the research is due to be presented at the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2021) in July.The paper introduces a method to detect new CNAME-based trackers that can be used by blocklist maintainers to thwart trackers before they become widespread.“The blocklist-based anti-tracking mechanisms rely heavily on the coverage of the blocklist (simply put: if a tracker is not added to the blocklist, it remains operational),” Van Goethem said.“EasyList already added entries in response to our paper,” he added.RELATED Apple’s Safari browser blocks CNAME cloaking in Big Sur privacy boost",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/say-my-cname-rise-of-sneaky-adtech-tactic-poses-threat-to-web-security-and-privacy,"['Privacy', 'DNS', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'XSS', 'Browsers', 'Apple', 'Safari', 'Microsoft', 'Google', 'Industry', 'News', 'GDPR', 'Compliance', 'Europe', 'Belgium']"
no,"Indian cyber-espionage activity rising amid growing rivalry with China, Pakistan",Cyber warfare: a Bollywood special,"ANALYSIS India is sometimes overlooked by some in the threat intelligence community, even though the South Asian nation has advanced cyber capabilities – not least a huge pool of talent.The country boasts a large number of engineers, programmers, and information security specialists, but not all of this tech talent was put to good use, even before the Covid-19 pandemic cast a shadow over the global economy.Their somewhat limited employment prospects are said to have created a swarm of underground Indian threat actors eager to show off their hacking talents and make money – a resource that the Indian government might be able to tap into in order to bolster its own burgeoning cyber-espionage resources.India is in catch-up mode for now, but has the technical resources to make rapid progress.Who is being targeted by Indian hacking groups?Geopolitical factors have fueled an increase in cyber threat activity both originating from and targeting India.Experts quizzed by The Daily Swig were unanimous in saying that the most important target of Indian cyber-espionage by far is Pakistan – a reflection of the decades-long struggle over the disputed region of Kashmir.China, India’s neighbour and an ally of Pakistan, is also a top target of state-sponsored Indian cyber-espionage.Paul Prudhomme, head of threat intelligence advisory at IntSights, told The Daily Swig: “Indian cyber-espionage differs from that of other top state-sponsored threats, such as those of Russia and China, in the less ambitious geographic scope of their attacks.”RECOMMENDED H2C smuggling named top web hacking technique of 2020Other common targets of Indian hacking activity include other nations of the South Asian subcontinent, such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. Indian espionage groups may sometimes expand their horizons further to occasional targets in Southeast Asia or the Middle East.Indian cyber-espionage groups typically seek information on Pakistan’s government, military, and other organizations to inform and improve its own national security posture.But this is far from the only game in town.For example, one Indian threat group called ‘Dark Basin’ has allegedly targeted advocacy groups, senior politicians, government officials, CEOs, journalists, and human rights activists across six continents over the last seven years.A powerhouse of South Asia, India boasts a large number of engineers, programmers, and infosec specialistsHow sophisticated are the techniques being used by Indian hacker groups?India is currently considered to have a less mature cyber warfare armoury and capability than the ‘Big Six’ – China, North Korea, Russia, Israel, the UK, and US – but this may change over time since its capability is growing.Chris Sedgwick, director of security operations at Talion, the managed security service spinoff of what used to be BAE System’s intelligence division, commented:The sophistication of the various Indian cyber threat actors do not appear to be in the same league as China or Russia, and rather than having the ability to call on a cache of 0-day exploits to utilise, they have been known to use less sophisticated – but still fairly effective – techniques such as decoy documents containing weaponised macros.Sometimes, simple social engineering attacks delivering a known commodity malware can be enough.Morgan Wright, chief security advisor at SentinelOne and former US State Department special advisor, told The Daily Swig: “India’s growing offensive capability is still immature compared to China, North Korea, Russia, Israel, the UK and US. However, there is no shortage of people with advanced technical skills in India.”With Covid-19 causing significant unemployment in India, it can be “safely assumed a portion of people with these skills will engage in cybercrime”, according to Wright.“Ironically, tactics learned in committing cybercrime will be of value to the intelligence and military establishment in India as they develop and grow units to engage in cyber warfare and espionage,” he said.Assaf Dahan, senior director and head of threat research at Cybereason, told The Daily Swig: “The level of sophistication of the activity groups affiliated with India can vary; some groups have shown a high level of sophistication and use of advanced custom-built tools or advanced exploits, while others exhibited significantly less sophisticated capabilities.“Sometimes a group might exhibit different levels of sophistication on different operations, based on the group’s needs and reasoning,” he added.Dahan concluded: “Another point to remember: the level of sophistication isn’t always correlated with the success rate of the group’s operation or goals. Sometimes, simple social engineering attacks delivering a known commodity malware can be enough to get the threat actors what they want.”What examples are there of Indian APT groups?Recent attacks by Indian hacker groups:The highly active cyber-espionage entity known as SideWinder has been plaguing governments and enterprises since 2012. A recently released report by AT&T Alien Labs shows most of SideWinder’s activity is heavily focused on South Asia and East Asia, with the group likely supporting Indian political interests.The allegedly Indian state-sponsored group Dropping Elephant has been known to target the Chinese government via spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.Viceroy Tiger has been known to use weaponised Microsoft Office documents in spear-phishing campaigns. Security researchers at Lookout recently went public with research on mobile malware attributed to the threat actors and rated as medium sophistication.?The level of direct Indian government involvement in some of these operations is contested.Cybereason’s Dahan cautioned: “The line between ‘state operated’ or ‘state ordered’ can be rather fine, so it’s not always easy to link certain operations directly to an official government or military institution, especially due to the growing popularity of cyber mercenaries (hackers-for-hire).”How might India expand its cyber warfare capabilities and defences?Through an emerging initiative to provide technology education to 400,000 low-income students, India will significantly increase its cyber “bench strength”, according to Mike Hamilton, former CISO for the City of Seattle and co-founder and CISO of cybersecurity firm CI Security.Hamilton predicted that a “cybercrime population will emerge [in India] and differentiate itself from nationalist motivations”.Other experts reckon the flow of talent will run the other way and allow Indian to expand its cyber-espionage capabilities from the cohorts of cybercriminals.Read more of the latest cybersecurity and hacking news from IndiaSo-called ‘hacking-as-a-service’ (HaaS) enriches and expands the talent pool from which Indian cyber espionage groups recruit, according to threat intel firm IntSights.“Jobs posted on the dark web are usually simpler attacks, such as compromising email passwords,” IntSights’ Prudhomme explained.“Cyber-espionage groups, such as Dropping Elephant, Viceroy Tiger, and Dark Basin have begun to draw upon this talent pool and raised the bar for the sophistication of attacks.”Geopolitical factors have led to an increase in cyber threat activity both originating from and targeting IndiaIs India increasing its cyber capabilities?The Indian military has invested in cyber operations to get ahead of its adversaries.In 2019, India consolidating its cyber forces by establishing the Defence Cyber Agency (DCA), a new tri-service agency for cyber warfare.The DCA is said to have more than 1,000 experts who will be distributed into a number of formations in the Army, Navy, and Air Force.Discover more infosec analysis from around the world“This will almost certainly result in better utilisation of resources, a much clearer objective, and more sophisticated attack techniques through the sharing of best practice,"" according to Talion’s Sedgwick.The DCA’s goal is to become capable of hacking into networks, mounting surveillance operations, and laying honeytraps.“Their capabilities and the scope of their attacks are growing but are not yet on par with those of China or North Korea,” Prudhomme believes.Which foreign threat groups are carrying out cyber-attacks on Indian entities?There are numerous groups targeting Indian entities, many of them publicly reported.Some groups that the Lookout Threat Intelligence team and others have tracked in the past include Stealth Mango and Tangelo, Transparent Tribe APT, and APT30, among others.Just as Indian cyber-espionage groups target Pakistan’s government, military, and other organizations in search of political and military intelligence, Pakistani cyber-espionage groups do likewise against equivalent Indian targets for much the same reasons.“Chinese cyber espionage groups also target India as a political, military, and economic rival and in support of the alliance between China and Pakistan,” according to IntSights’ Prudhomme.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/indian-cyber-espionage-activity-rising-amid-growing-rivalry-with-china-pakistan,"['Cyber', 'Warfare', 'India', 'China', 'Network', 'Security', 'North', 'Korea', 'Phishing', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Coronavirus', 'Government', 'Industry', 'News', 'Asia', 'Analysis', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Legal', 'Privacy', 'Malware', 'Ransomware', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks']"
no,H2C smuggling named top web hacking technique of 2020,‘We anticipate some serious carnage in future’,"A novel alternative to traditional HTTP request smuggling that spotlighted an obsolete, hitherto obscure protocol has been recognized as 2020’s top web hacking technique.Unveiled by Bishop Fox researchers in September, HTTP/2 cleartext (H2C) smuggling “abuses H2C-unaware front-ends to create a tunnel to backend systems, enabling attackers to bypass frontend rewrite rules and exploit internal HTTP headers,” explains James Kettle, head of research at PortSwigger Web Security*, in the company’s rundown of 2020’s most impressive web hacking techniques.BACKGROUND HTTP request smuggling: HTTP/2 opens a new attack tunnel“Conceptually similar” to, but “significantly more practical” than, last year’s WebSocket smuggling, “request tunnelling exploitation is an emerging art so this one may be a slow burn, but we anticipate some serious carnage in future,” continues Kettle.Claiming silver medal in the top 10 web hacking techniques, which landed today (February 24) following a community vote and final verdict by an expert panel, is research from fellow PortSwigger researcher Gareth Heyes that breaks new ground in PDF exploitation.In Portable Data exFiltration, Heyes “tackles the format and stretches PDF parsers to go from PDF link injection to document theft, JavaScript execution and SSRF”, says Kettle, who noted that he did not vote for his colleague’s technique, given the obvious conflict of interest.READ MORE XSS for PDFs – New injection technique offers rich pickings for security researchersBronze position was taken by British bug hunter Sam Curry, who exploited the “entangled mess of proxies, load balancers, and micro services” powering modern websites in his research, ‘Attacking secondary contexts in web applications’.Kettle said Curry’s “exceptional clarity” and “numerous case studies make this an outstanding, must-watch presentation for newbies and experts alike”.Farewell SQLi?“Once again we’re seeing a nice overview of novel techniques discovered by quality research, showing that despite significant improvements in secure development practices and supporting frameworks there are still numerous ways in which applications fail,” Wim Remes, founder and CEO of Belgian infosec firm Wire Security, tells The Daily Swig.While countless other sectors have had to adapt their business model in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, offensive web security research is continually being forced to evolve in response to ongoing improvements to application security.Micha? Bentkowski, chief security researcher at Polish cybersecurity outfit Securitum, tells The Daily Swig: “Most of the entries don’t present a completely new or novel attack technique but rather an improvement to an already known one.“I think that this proves that ‘classic’ web application vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XXE etc. are getting rarer and rarer, thus attackers and researchers need to come up with more and more sophisticated methods to exploit the vulnerabilities.”Bishop Fox researchers unveiled their H2C smuggling research in September 2020While applications themselves are becoming more secure, the increasingly multifaceted layers below are creating opportunities for innovative researchers.“Most attacks don’t touch the web application directly but the layers below it: reverse proxies, caches, routers, TLS, HTTP/2, etc,” explains Bentkowski. “I believe that this trend is going to continue, given the complexity of webapps is increasing.”Remes makes a similar point: “The cloud makes everything easier, or so it seems,” he says.“With the advent of serverless computing, we risk [losing] insight into the extremely abstracted layers that allow our applications to run. This includes proxies, load balancers, web application firewalls, and all of the very complex functions they provide.“Understanding what those components do, how they impact our applications, and – most importantly – what they do not do, is critical to developing a threat model for your application or infrastructure.”The top 10 web hacking techniques of 2020H2C smuggling: Request smuggling Via HTTP/2 cleartextPortable data exFiltration: XSS for PDFsAttacking secondary contexts in web applicationsWhen TLS hacks youNAT slipstreamingSmuggling HTTP headers through reverse proxiesUnauthenticated RCE on MobileIron MDMImageMagick – Shell injection via PDF passwordAttacking MS Exchange web interfacesWAF evasion techniquesDevOps sandboxAccording to Remes, the emergence of DevOps as “the preferred way of running software factories” is reflected in the top 10’s composition.“Some of the weaknesses have moved from the code to the infrastructure and supporting components,” he says. “Managing how your code interacts with all the different components and how they contribute to your attack surface should be of the utmost priority.”Catch up on the latest secure software development newsLooking ahead to the rest of 2021, Bentkowski notes the inclusion of only one client-side attack, Heyes’s ‘XSS for PDFs’ piece.“These attacks seem to be undervalued, especially in a world where almost all sensitive data is processed via the browser! I hope that this year will see more novel attacks in this area.”Remes adds: “I’m impressed that in a year like 2020, where everybody has been put under extreme stress, the output from our community, that is so committed to sharing knowledge, has been exemplary.“We should always remember that the best defenders out there rely on this information to continuously improve their protective mechanisms.“It is much too easy to see the disclosure of novel techniques as counterproductive.

no,The criminal element: Cybercrime cases in the Netherlands more than doubled in 2020,"Threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, warns one of the country’s top legal experts","Cybercrime cases in the Netherlands more than doubled in 2020, according to official figures.According to the Netherlands’ public prosecutor’s office (Openbaar Ministerie), criminal cases with a “cybercrime element” were 127% higher last year than in 2019.The impact on victims increased, too. WhatsApp-related fraud cost individuals an average of €2,800 ($3,400), while spoofing attacks targeted against users’ bank accounts cost €10,000 ($12,200).The Openbaar Ministerie also reported an increase in cyber-attacks against hospitals, with an increase in both ransomware and DDoS attacks.The chairman of the Netherlands’ Board of Attorneys General, Gerrit van der Burg, warned that cybercrime is becoming increasingly sophisticated.Combating this will need increasing investment by law enforcement agencies, he said.EU-wide trendThe latest cybercrime figures from the Netherlands align with trends across Europe. Europol’s Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) found that increases in phishing, social engineering, and malware attacks are being echoed across the continent.“There is increasing concern about cybercrime in Europe for two reasons,” Chris Dimitriadis, executive adviser at Intralot and past board chair at ISACA, told The Daily Swig.“Europe is accelerating digital transformation across many industries. And the pandemic has seen a lot of people working from home. Their productivity is based on network and information infrastructure. Both trends make us more vulnerable to online crime.”RELATED Universities struggle to defend against surging cyber-attacks during coronavirus pandemicThe Dutch cybercrime figures could even be on the low side, suggests Jon Shamah, chair of EEMA, a European cybersecurity think tank.“The environment is getting more and more dangerous for citizens,” he told The Daily Swig.Governments need to do more to make online crime less attractive, he suggested, and improve international co-operation.SMEs at riskAccording to Marc Vael, global CISO at Esko and chair of ISACA’s cloud security task force, small and medium-sized businesses are also being targeted through fraudulent invoice campaigns, and ransomware.“Larger organisations have the ability to better protect themselves,” Vael told The Daily Swig. “Medium-sized businesses are not large enough to have those defensive systems, but they are large enough to pay out €10,000, €20,000, or €30,000 to fraudsters.”Read more of the latest European cybersecurity newsHe also cautions that organizations where staff are working from home need to take steps to maintain security.“Firms should make sure devices are being updated, even if they are not connected to the network, and that you have the same security for people working from home as you would expect at work,” he recommends.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/the-criminal-element-cybercrime-cases-in-the-netherlands-more-than-doubled-in-2020,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Netherlands', 'Europe', 'Healthcare', 'Ransomware', 'Social', 'Media', 'Finance', 'Fraud', 'Cybercrime', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'DDoS', 'Malware', 'Coronavirus', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Mobile']"
no,Nginx: Server misconfigurations found in the wild that expose websites to attacks,Widely used web server’s flexibility means mistakes all too easy to make,"Security researchers at Detectify have discovered a series of middleware misconfigurations in Nginx that could leave web applications vulnerable to attack.Lightweight, modular, open source, and with a user-friendly configuration format, Nginx is one of the most widely-used web servers, powering one in three websites globally.However Detectify, which maintains an automated web application scanner, says this very flexibility makes it easy to make mistakes that could leave a site open to attack.Late last year, the Detectify team analyzed almost 50,000 unique Nginx configuration files downloaded from GitHub with Google BigQuery, finding a number of possible misconfigurations that could leave web applications open to attack.These issues included issuing root location, unsafe variable use, raw backend response reading, and merge slashes set to off.Proof of conceptsAnd, says Frans Rosen, the company’s co-founder and security advisor, many similar misconfigurations have been spotted in the wild.“A lot of companies nowadays use bug bounties as a way for external security researchers to report security bugs to the company,” Rosen told The Daily Swig.“This allowed us to identify some of these misconfigurations on live targets and make proof of concepts showing how we utilized the misconfiguration to serve our own content on their main domain.”Catch up on the latest security research newsThe team says it has seen an increasing number of hosts using proxy solutions for static content against Google Cloud Storage and AWS S3 on /media/, /images/, /sitemap/, and similar locations, with weak regular expressions allowing HTTP splitting to happen.This bug, says Detectify, was found in the wild multiple times on bug bounty programs.Dangerous variablesThe team also examined other possible misconfigurations that allowed for controlling of a proxied host, accessing internal Nginx blocks, and accessing localhost-restricted Nginx blocks.Rosen says many of these issues weren’t picked up by Gixy, the Nginx configuration static analyzer created by Yandex, when scanning the configuration files.So how safe is middleware generally, and Nginx in particular?“The main idea is that it allows a lot of flexibility and control by utilizing the webserver like this. However due to the fact that it’s really common, these misconfigurations will happen,” says Rosen.“There are some things when configuring Nginx that makes it easy to do wrong. For example, using the variable $uri is dangerous, but $request_uri is safe.“Those things are very easy to do wrong, and it’s not clear when using one or the other if you are okay or not.”READ MORE ServiceNow admin creds among hundreds of passwords exposed in cloud security blunder",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nginx-server-misconfigurations-found-in-the-wild-that-expose-websites-to-attacks,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Google', 'GitHub', 'Cloud', 'Security']"
no,Bad education: Universities struggle to defend against surging cyber-attacks during coronavirus pandemic,Number of ransomware attacks against the sector doubled between 2019 and 2020,"Cash-strapped universities worldwide are struggling to defend against a surging number of cyber-attacks, according to a report that lays bare the impact of Covid-19 on the sector.Published today (February 23), a detailed threat analysis from cybersecurity services provider BlueVoyant found that ransomware attacks against higher education institutions doubled between 2019 and 2020, as cybercriminals sensed the industry’s vulnerability.The 2019 attack against Monroe College, which was ransomed for $2 million, was the sector’s first instance of ‘big game hunting’, say the authors, while universities have been falling prey to ‘name and shame’ extortion schemes since April 2020.Punishing costsThe average cost of remediating ransomware infections in 2020 was $447,000, a sum universities can ill afford amid postponed enrolment applications, refund demands, and the wholesale loss of revenues from international students.Data breaches, which accounted for half of all cybersecurity events affecting the sector in 2019, exacted even more punishing costs – averaging $3.9 million, according to a 2020 IBM study.John Farley, managing director for AIG’s cyber practice, told BlueVoyant that “the most prudent risk managers” were protecting their bottom line by “deploying cyber risk transfer mechanisms via both contracts and cyber insurance”.Expanding attack surfaceAs well as absorbing unprecedented financial losses, higher education institutions have had to reorient their business model in a way that expands an already considerable attack surface.“Forced to abandon teaching in person,” there is “an ever-increasing reliance on mobile devices, remote learning, and third-party education partners”, says the report.RELATED Universities urged to review remote learning software in order to minimize security risksAn open source analysis found that one in three data breach events over the past two years were related to remote or blended learning tools.BlueVoyant also highlighted the serious risk posed by the widespread use on university networks of personal devices and torrenting, a large-file-sharing technique that is often abused to smuggle malware into networks.Security researchers linked data breaches against more than 200 institutions to nation-state actors, which have also targeted universities involved in vaccine research and conducted large-scale phishing campaigns against the sector.Credential stuffingUniversities appear to be the juiciest of credential stuffing targets, with students using university emails to log into a widening range of services, even long beyond graduation.Students at the top 10 Ivy League schools had an average of 13 unique university credentials each, researchers found.With student credentials “among the most voluminous and highly trafficked PII [personally identifiable information] data” on the dark web, universities were hit by an average of 10,000 brute-forcing attacks per week – far outstripping the proportion of inbound adversarial activity seen against other sectors.Predictable passwordsDemonstrating the impact of such attacks, Boston University temporarily disabled more than 1,000 compromised student email addresses last year after the accounts were used to flood the institution’s email servers with spam.An analysis of .edu passwords arising from a huge breach that led to those account takeovers – the 2018 attack on online textbook rental service Chegg – also suggests that cybercriminals could readily customize their password permutations to the profile of their targets.For instance, ‘sex’ (such as ‘sexy!teacher1’), ‘professor’ (‘kill_the_Professor’), and grades (‘aplusgrades’) recurred frequently, as did ‘book’ (featuring 20,984 times), ‘smart’ (3,139), and ‘beer’ (3,408).Catch up on the latest education security newsAll too predictably, ‘password’ outnumbered them all with 65,420 instances.An analysis of email/password ‘combolists’ leveraged for credential stuffing attacks found that nearly 9% of passwords associated with .edu domains were found among the 14 million most commonly-used passwords contained within the RockYou.txt password dictionary.Unique risksStuart Panensky, partner at FisherBroyles, told BlueVoyant that “the education and learning sciences sectors face unique privacy and cyber risks due to the combination of sensitive data they traffic in, the nature of how technology is deployed throughout the sector, and the myriad of state and federal laws and regulations that govern these issues”.Despite this, 66% of more than 2,700 universities analyzed across 43 countries lacked basic email security configurations, 38% had open or unsecured database ports, and 22% had at least one open RDP port. Some 86% showed evidence of inbound botnet targeting.Universities at least appear to recognize the importance of bolstering their human defenses, with around three quarters of CIOs and senior campus officials surveyed in 2019 citing “hiring and retaining IT talent” as the top institutional priority.However, around the same proportion said uncompetitive salaries and benefits were a major barrier to achieving this goal – and that was before the pandemic decimated revenues.RecommendationsBlueVoyant does not envisage a return to the pre-Covid status quo. “The attack surface for schools has metastasized, and there is no going back,” it says.With this in mind, the authors have urged higher education institutions to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all email and sensitive accounts, mandate 15-character password minimums, and block password reuse and simple passwords.They are also advised to monitor email accounts, networks, and cloud services for authentication anomalies and screen passwords against blacklists containing commonly used and compromised credentials.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/bad-education-universities-struggle-to-defend-against-surging-cyber-attacks-during-coronavirus-pandemic,"['Education', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Coronavirus', 'Ransomware', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Passwords', 'Network', 'Security', 'Research', 'Cybercrime', 'Malware', 'Phishing', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Email', 'Security', 'Mobile', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hardware', 'Authentication', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'UK', 'Europe']"
no,Popular Node.js package vulnerable to command injection attacks,Developer of ‘systeminformation’ library addresses moderate severity flaw in security update,"The maintainers of systeminformation, a popular Node.js package, have patched a bug that left applications vulnerable to command injection attacks.Systeminformation provides dozens of functions for retrieving detailed hardware, system, and operating system information from servers hosting Node.js applications.The library has more than 850,000 weekly downloads on NPM, the main online repository for Node.js packages.Command injection attacks happen when a malicious actor manipulates an application to send system-level commands to the host server.For example, if a function inserts user input strings into system commands without sanitizing them, malicious actors might be able to exploit the loophole to cause the function to execute arbitrary system-level commands.Edge caseIn general, systeminformation is not meant to be used in conjunction with user input, Sebastian Hildbrandt, the maintainer of the software, told The Daily Swig.“Systeminformation is a package intended to be used at the backend. What I personally was expecting was that developers use this package carefully,” he said.READ MORE Dependency confusion attack mounted via PyPi repo exposes flawed package installer behaviorBut Hildebrandt added that there are some use cases where developers open some of the library’s functions to their end users, making it possible to pass parameters that will then be forwarded to the systeminformation package.“The systeminformation package comes with a set of sanitizing functions to provide a basic parameter check, but of course I am not aware of the context the package is used,” Hildebrandt says.‘Improper parameter checking’Four functions in systeminformation were found to be vulnerable to command injection.According to Hildebrandt, the vulnerability was caused due to a special case of improper parameter checking and array sanitation.Catch up on more of the latest security vulnerability news“If the input was not sanitized and users had the possibility to pass a JavaScript array as a parameter to the given functions, this could lead to executing malicious code like [a denial of service] DoS on the machine where systeminformation is running,” he said.String input is not affected by the bug.Secure developmentThe vulnerability – classified as ‘moderate’ on GitHub – was fixed in the latest version of systeminformation. The maintainers advise all developers to upgrade their version of the package.They have also provided the names of the functions for which developers should perform manual sanitation of parameters, a workaround check that can be used in cases where they can’t readily upgrade to the latest version of systeminformation.The bug was discovered by a user of the systeminformation package, Hildbrandt said.“For me as a developer (and also user of other packages), I am happy to see that other developers help to make packages more secure,” he concluded.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE ServiceNow admin credentials exposed in cloud security blunder",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/popular-node-js-package-vulnerable-to-command-injection-attacks,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Node.js', 'Research', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'JavaScript', 'GitHub', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hardware', 'IoT', 'Secure', 'Development']"

RDP [remote desktop protocol], access enables an attacker to take over a victim’s computer and is the most common type listed, at 17% of the total.Compromised RDP credentials are often a vector of ransomware attacks.Domain administrator access is also sought after and makes up 16% of the listings with an average price of around $8,200.Listings of VPN access have increased, as more and more organizations have moved to remote working.The average access price for compromised VPN setups comes in at around $2,900, according to Digital Shadows.This constitutes 15% of the total dark web broker listings, although ads claiming to offer access to compromised Citrix environments, enterprise control panels, and web content management systems also feature heavily.Digital undergroundMiscreants are cashing in for breaking into corporate networks, with a combination of increased remote working and the success of ransomware driving the growth of the marketplace.If ransomware distributors have partnered with particular initial access brokers then they are not advertising this fact, Digital Shadows told The Daily Swig.Catch up on more of the latest cybercrime news“Digital Shadows has observed several ransomware operators actively recruiting initial access brokers (IABs) for their operations,” Stefano De Blasi, threat researcher at Digital Shadows, explained.“However, no threat actors have publicly advertised a successful ongoing partnership with an IAB.”“Therefore, while it is highly likely that ransomware operators use IABs to gain an initial foothold in a target, there is no publicly available intelligence to indicate who is working with whom,” he added.Misfortune 500Estimating the number of initial access brokers actively at work, much less how they are organized, is a tricky business.“Our analysis of more than 500 listings published in 2020 indicate that more than 150 active IABs were operating in that timeframe,” De Blasi told The Daily Swig.“These threat actors typically work as middlemen, providing other cybercriminals the initial access needed to conduct their operations.”De Blasi concluded: “Technical sophistication levels can vary broadly among IABs, making it difficult to paint a uniform picture of their internal organizational structure and business model.”Enterprise network defenders are far from powerless in combating the threat.Digital Shadows has proposed mitigation strategies against each of the most exploited vulnerabilities.

no,Tackling UK cyber fraud requires greater collaboration between public and private sectors – report,Paper calls for increased knowledge sharing between government and businesses,"An independent report has stressed the importance of collaboration between UK law enforcement and private sector industries in tackling cybercrime.The paper (PDF), from think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), has laid out a list of recommendations to curb cyber-enabled fraud within the UK.It was released today (February 22) in the lead up to the revision of the National Cyber Security Strategy, which is slated for publication in 2021.The report was written based on insight from interviews with experts, literature reviews, and surveys undertaken with various stakeholders including law enforcement, cybersecurity industry professionals, and financial services workers.It concludes that greater collaboration between all stakeholders and a “strong central direction” are paramount to defeating cyber-enabled fraud.‘Leadership vacuum’The report’s authors claim that cyber fraud does not receive the appropriate level of coordinated response from acrossunits, financial sectors, and government agencies.Responsibilities for tackling the issue are unclear, they say, creating a “sizable leadership vacuum at the policy level.“The current model suffers from contrasting levels of prioritization of cyber fraud acrossdifferent stakeholders,” the paper reads.“Some financial institutions see cyber fraud as a high priority due to the risk of reputational damage, while others are more likely to think of it as just another cost of doing business.”Meanwhile, for most law enforcement agencies, “it is not always considereda high priority compared to violent or drug-related crimes due to its less visible and lessphysically harmful nature”.In order to tackle this growing problem, the report suggests that information sharing practices across public and private sectors need to improve.Read more of the latest news about computer-enabled fraudDespite the existence of numerous information-sharing partnerships and industry forums, the authors claim that there are still “significant limitations”.Therefore, the authors set out 11 key recommendations for businesses, government, and other institutions to follow.These include a more preemptive approach to tackling cybercrime from The National Crime Agency and City of London Police, the publication of comprehensive guidance on how private sector organizations can share information with law enforcement, and the creation of a pilot initiative focused on integrating cyber policies, anti-money laundering and fraud data, and dissemination of “sanitized examples of best practice”.More recommendations can be found in the report (PDF).Coronavirus pandemicThe paper also details how the coronavirus pandemic, and particularly the widespread switch to remote working, has affected cyber fraud cases.When asked whether they thought Covid-19 has had an impact, 61% of respondents said the number of fraud attempts they have seen have “greatly increased”.Indeed, coronavirus scams and phishing attacks have plagued both the public and private sector since the UK first went into lockdown in March 2020.Read more of the latest news about coronavirus scams and phishing attacksThe report’s authors expressed concern over the number of respondents who said their company has not taken adequate measures to protect employees working from home.“It is concerning that the majority of the survey respondents for this research (70%) felt thatthe increase in remote working has not been matched by increased efforts from businesses to improve their cybersecurity and anti-fraud protection,” the report reads.‘Blind faith’The authors also stressed the importance of upskilling workers to understand how to defend themselves against attacks, given that cybersecurity knowledge is “often concentrated in a select few individuals in a company, typically in the IT department.“Great amounts of trust are put on these individuals to maintain the security of their business devices, as they would do in an office environment.“As a result, people often exhibit blind faith in the safety of the systems they use. This presents an opportunity that criminals may seek to exploit and therefore requires significant upskilling of employees.”Speaking to The Daily Swig during a press briefing last week, co-author Sneha Dawda said that they looked to various other reports and countries for inspiration.The Netherlands in particular stood out, Dawda said, citing its “extremely innovative model of tackling cybercrimes”.She also looked to the current UK National Cyber Security Strategy and its emphasis on understanding “overall national priorities and values” when tackling cybercrime.“It aligns perfectly [with] that notion that we need to tackle cybercrime and we need a more innovative model to do so,” said Dawda. “In the last five years we’ve pumped a lot of money into cybercrime but we’ve kind of left fraud out a bit.”Co-author Ardi Janjeva added that while the report was influenced by various inquiries that include elements of computer-enabled fraud, “there has been no comparable inquiry that would focus specifically on cyber fraud, and that’s part of the rationale for this paper”.READ MORE Fake websites and false cures: Interpol warns of Covid-19 vaccine scams",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/tackling-uk-cyber-fraud-requires-greater-collaboration-between-public-and-private-sectors-report,"['UK', 'Fraud', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Cybercrime', 'Phishing', 'Research', 'Organizations', 'Government', 'Netherlands', 'Coronavirus', 'Legal', 'Europe', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Compliance', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,Center of excellence established to fight DNS abuse,Malware slingers and spammers targeted by cross-industry institute led by industry veteran,"The launch of a new institute to combat abuse of the Domain Name System (DNS) by phishing, spam, and malware campaigns has been welcomed by an independent expert.The DNS Abuse Institute was launched last week by Public Interest Registry (PIR) as a way to bring together leaders in the anti-abuse space to fund research, publish recommended practices, share data, and provide tools to identify and report DNS abuse.The initiative is an extension of PIR’s previous efforts to fight abuse of the cornerstone internet technology by malware slingers, spammers, and other ne’er-do-wells. Two years ago, the organization set up the ‘Framework to Address Abuse’, a guideline for both registries and registrars when it comes to addressing DNS abuse.Catch up on the latest DNS security newsPIR launched its new institute to support the broader DNS community as part of its non-profit mission.Graeme Bunton, who has more than a decade of experience working in DNS abuse policy, will serve as the DNS Abuse Institute’s inaugural director.‘Pervasive’ problemCricket Liu, chief DNS architect at Infoblox, welcomed the establishment of the body.“Infoblox does research into DNS abuse, too, but the problem is so pervasive that having PIR join in is most welcome,” Liu told The Daily Swig. “I'm particularly hopeful of the role they could play in education and coordination.”In response to our questions, PIR said that it has always sought to lead in the anti-abuse space and implement best practices for .org and other top-level domains to address DNS abuse. It characterized the establishment of the DNS Abuse Institute as the logical next step on this journey.“Our objective for the Institute is to combat DNS Abuse, and not just for .ORG but the entire DNS,” according to Graeme Bunton, director of the newly formed institute. “To do that, we know it will take the collaboration of large and small organizations, security researchers, and other stakeholders.”Bunton added: “The Institute will serve a number of key functions: as a gathering point for interested organizations to share their best practices and to collaborate on tools – improving approaches across the entire industry, as well as to conduct research that helps the community understand the issues so we can come together to address them.”DON’T FORGET TO READ Brave browser’s Tor feature found to leak .onion queries to ISPs",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/center-of-excellence-established-to-fight-dns-abuse,"['DNS', 'Malware', 'Phishing', 'Industry', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations']"
no,ServiceNow admin credentials among hundreds of passwords exposed in cloud security blunder,Vulnerability that could lead to full environment compromise has now been patched,"UPDATED More than 600 enterprises, universities, and government agencies may have inadvertently exposed their ServiceNow login credentials – many with administrator privileges – due to a vulnerability in the IT support platform.Now patched, the security flaw centered on how the platform’s ‘Help the Help Desk’ feature requested information from endpoints and left unencrypted passwords publicly viewable on all ServiceNow instances that used the feature.‘Entire environment compromise’Gaining administrative access to a ServiceNow cloud instance would give an attacker free rein over customer support tickets, employee data, internal documentation, internal IT tickets, internal HR tickets, and other potentially sensitive customer information.“Other ServiceNow features can even provide command execution on servers and workstations enrolled in various ServiceNow integrations,” said security researcher Jordan Potti in a blog post documenting his discovery.RELATED ServiceDesk Plus vulnerability could give attackers full access to IT support systems“Given the amount of information and access ServiceNow has in many environments, this can lead directly to entire environment compromise.”Hinder the Help DeskServiceNow, a cloud computing platform used by enterprises to manage digital workflows, has more than 17,000 customers.Enterprise users can configure the Help the Help Desk feature to collect information, via a WMI script, from the endpoints of employees and customers.According to Potti, however, “the credentials for the request were stored in a public JavaScript file on all ServiceNow instances” that used the feature.The file was readily accessible at https://<customername>.servicenow.com/HelpTheHelpDesk.jsdbx, and the credentials were visible “at the top of the script for anyone’s viewing pleasure”.Worse still, the base64-encoded passwords were not encrypted, even if the prefix encrypt: misleadingly indicated otherwise.Potti added: “How this hadn’t been found before is interesting.”Amplifying the riskMany ServiceNow users exacerbated the security risk by using their administrator credentials when using SOAP [Simple Object Access Protocol] authentication for running the WMI script, overlooking the official documentation that outlines a process for creating an unprivileged role for the job.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsAs a result, the researcher discovered numerous administrator-level usernames such as sn_admin, admin, and servicenow-admin among the exposed credentials.“In more than one case, credentials provided full admin access to ServiceNow instances that were used by global companies with bug bounty programs,” noted Potti.Simple to GETThe researcher said simple GET requests were sufficient to determine when a host was exposing credentials.“Using some open source reconnaissance, a list of ServiceNow subdomains was collected and each one was issued a request for the HelpTheHelpDesk script,” he continued.“If the httpUsername and httpPassword values were filled, the request was logged.”The researcher unearthed the problem on August 15, 2020, and alerted ServiceNow on August 20.The developers released a patch on October 8 and the vulnerability was publicly disclosed yesterday (February 21).A ServiceNow spokesperson told The Daily Swig: “ServiceNow is committed to protecting its customers and, like many software companies, runs a program to catch and patch bugs before they are exploited. In this case, as soon as the bug was identified by a security researcher a patch was created to correct it.”The Daily Swig has also contacted Jordan Potti for further comment.

no,Dependency confusion attack mounted via PyPi repo exposes flawed package installer behavior,Novel supply chain attack detected in the wild just days after security researcher disclosed the technique,"UPDATED The default behavior of pip, the Python package installer, leaves the software development process vulnerable to ‘dependency confusion’ attacks, a software vendor has discovered.Use of the novel supply chain attack technique has been detected in the wild only a week after it was disclosed by its architect.Pip’s insecure behavior highlights a “major problem in the way code is being shared and reused through node package manager [NPM], PyPi, and other online repositories”, says Henri Terho, chief R&D evangelist at Qentinel, in a blog post.RELATED Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowInfiltrating the build processThe attack came to light on February 16 when a developer at the automated software testing specialist reported the mysterious failure of a build pipeline when fetching internal libraries.The company then traced the problem to suspicious packages in the Python Package Index (PyPi) repository.With the help of Python’s security team, these packages were blocklisted the next day (February 17) in order to prevent them from infiltrating any more builds.Qentinel also “registered the domains that the packages were supposedly registered from” to themselves to prevent the rogue libraries’ creator from abusing them to spoof emails.Dependency confusion: A growing threatAs reported by The Daily Swiglast week, security researcher Alex Birsan fashioned and successfully deployed the ‘dependency confusion’ technique against more than 35 organizations, including Apple, Microsoft, and PayPal.BACKGROUND Researcher hacks Apple, Microsoft, and other major tech companies in novel supply chain attack“As described by Alex, dependency confusion attack exploits misconfigured build scripts and one-off mistakes of developers to pull the malicious library from the public repository and not the actual library from a private one,” says Terho.“The publicly released package then contains malicious code which phones home and even allows for remote code execution.”The attack surface for such attacks is enormous, given how routinely private and public dependencies are pulled into applications’ source code.“These package indexes are constantly growing in their role as an attack vector against companies,” Terho tells The Daily Swig, noting the progression from ‘typosquatting’ techniques to “more advanced attack vectors”.And as “more software is being developed on top of shared libraries – for example a quick web project I did only had about 100 lines of own code but over 10 libraries from NPM – this leads to growing risk for everyone,” he adds.“I think the community now has to start taking a more proactive stance on ‘LibSec’, [the] security of imported public libraries, and there are now even companies operating on that space, such as Snyk.Wake-up callAs with Birsan’s NPM packages, the PyPi packages thankfully seemed to contain no malicious code – giving the software development ecosystem a salutary wake-up call about the threat.The packages “were empty placeholder libraries”, found Qentinel.“For us it was lucky,” says Terho. “Seems like it was a trial run by somebody, but I can easily see an automated script scanning for private packages and deploying public malicious packages to these ecosystems as a way to access a lot of companies who are not as awake on the infra security side.”Quentinel identified three rogue libraries created by an unknown PyPi account that were being used by four of its products: Qentinel Pace, QWeb, QVision, and QMobile.Since pip defaults to fetching libraries from PyPi, “those external libraries were fetched, but not the actual libraries from our private repositories, explains Terho.“The newly created public repositories did not contain our source code, so the dependencies failed in build.”Insecure by defaultPip’s insecure behavior centered on the –extra-index-url parameter, which checks whether the library exists in the specified and public package indexes, then, if more than one version is found, installs the package with the highest version number.All the PyPi attacker had to do was upload a library with a very high version number.“This problem has to be solved at the build pipeline level in updating” the “default behavior of pip and other tools,” says Terho.In the meantime, developers can mitigate the problem by only using -index-url to specify the pip’s custom repository address, thereby retrieving the package from the custom, rather than public, repository.Terho advises “clients to purge all caches in their build pipelines which might contain the fake repositories and check that their build scripts are configured correctly.”He also recommends that anyone who has updated or installed Pace Connect between February 15-17 reinstall the packages.This article was updated on February 22 with additional comments from Henri Terho of Qentinel.RELATED Centris: New tool helps prevent software supply chain

no,"‘In security, every problem is different’ – Offensive Security’s Ning Wang on training the next generation of infosec pros","Curious, creative problem-solvers required – and ‘the 10,000-hour rule does not skip security’","“We train people with things they will see in the real world,” says Ning Wang, CEO of infosec and pen test training firm Offensive Security (‘Offsec’).Almost a year on since we spoke to Wang about her first year at the helm, The Daily Swig caught up with the former Hacker One COO/CFO again to discuss Offsec’s recent revamp of much of its course library in response to community feedback and technological changes.In this wide-ranging interview, she also discusses creating viable career paths for security novices, the acquisition of VulnHub, and ramping up the development of Kali Linux, the popular Debian-based Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and pen testers.How has your second year as CEO gone, and how has the pandemic affected your modus operandi?The first year was just getting some basic things in place, and the second year was about really building the muscle to scale, whether on the people, processes or system side.The pandemic did not hurt us from a demand perspective, especially on the consumer side. And most of our training is self-paced, so we’re already a perfect fit for remote learning.We can’t obviously do our in-person training, so we introduced a new product called Offsec Academy, a 13-week, instructor-led, synchronous training course with self-learning in between lectures, demos, and one-on-one time.It’s had tremendous feedback and is here to stay post-pandemic.And [our workforce was] already more than half ‘distributed’ before the pandemic, so it was almost business as usual, and we had toolkits ready to deploy to help employees with the additional mental stress, the lack of normalcy.Why do you think your training and certification programs have become so widely adopted – now buy up to more than 4,000 companies worldwide, including more than 90% of the Fortune 100?The support from the community, the fact we listen to the community, and the fact the quality is optimized for learning things you need to do your day-to-day job is paying off.We are not just building CTF machines; we train people with things they will see in the real world.I think more companies recognize it’s really hard to find, train, and retain good security professionals. Those skills you can’t get easily just by reading a book; you really have to do it hands-on and [the fact that] our certification is increasingly required for jobs is a testament to that.It’s not about how to use this tool or that scanner. It’s about being able to think creatively and critically, about solving problems – and in security, every time the problem is different.We recently launched an ETBD advanced pen test course and Windows exploit [and reverse engineering] course.We completely rewrote our flagship course, penetration testing with Kali Linux [PWK], which hadn’t been upgraded for several years. We added an Active Directory and our PWK labs grew from around 40 machines to more than 70.Read more interviews with leading security prosThe overwhelming community feedback was: “you guys actually addressed all my complaints”.[Our approach] is very much bottom-up: we came from the community, the community really loves us, and they tell each other that the best way [to get trained] is go get an OSCP [Offensive Security Certified Professional].We launched the AWAE [Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation] based on community demand.A user recently posted a YouTube video about getting his ETBD certification – you could not pay for such a good testimonial.We want our training to evolve with the technology. We came out with a pretty major refresh of AWE in 2020, and [replaced the] CTP course with three courses because defense has gotten so much better.And when I joined, Offsec didn’t even have a dedicated sales and marketing team, so we really stepped up our sales and marketing effort.Have you made any progress in providing viable career paths for aspiring infosec professionals with little to no technical knowledge?When Offsec first started, it was targeted at people who were already doing the job and had quite a bit of prerequisite needed to do the PWK.As OSCP became more famous, we saw more people who were still in school [who wanted to do the course]. But you need sufficient prerequisites – whether on Linux, networking or scripting – to take PWK sufficiently well to earn your OSCP.So last year we launched a lab-only product called ‘Proving Grounds [PG] Play and Practice’, which makes it easier for people to get into security, [but is also] another way [experienced] people can keep their skills sharp and current.Offensive Security funds and maintains the Kali Linux projectHave you noticed any recent progress on shrinking the cybersecurity skills gap globally?All the numbers I see, it [the skills gap] is roughly the same. Depending on which source you look at, it may even be bigger.The demand for security talent is increasing and training people takes time. Many [organizations] want somebody who is already very skilled with lots of experience – but there’s a very limited number of people like that.So last year I took on two speaking opportunities and tried to promote a different approach: if we don’t have people already in security with everything we need, we should look in adjacent spaces, whether it’s a software developer, network engineer or system admin.To be a successful cybersecurity professional you need curiosity, creativity, and to be a problem solver, and you have to put in the time – the 10,000-hour rule does not skip security.RECOMMENDED ‘Train the basics’ – Bug bounty hunter ‘Xel’ on forging a lucrative career in ethical hackingWe have talent at Offsec who studied philosophy, or worked in the mail room, or were system admins, and after going through the OSCP journey they are [among the] best security talent [around].My own journey is where I realized that there is another way to fill the talent gap.I did a PhD in physics and transitioned to doing business at McKinsey. They put me through a mini-MBA. So I tell people not to be too narrow-minded.Anything to say on the latest Kali Linux developments?We formed a dedicated Kali team when I joined, and we are investing more in that team in 2021.We have had quarterly releases since 2019. We are partnering with some open source tool developers who will release their latest tools exclusively on Kali for a period of time.Whether it’s the Python 2 [end-of-life] or ZSH [becoming the default shell], not everything is very popular. People are used to how Kali had been before, but it’s necessary to position Kali into the future.We’re not slowing down [Kali’s development]; if anything, we’re going to accelerate.Last summer you acquired VulnHub, a provider of offline, open source, virtual machines for sharpening hacking skills. How do you plan to develop and, alongside your Exploit Database, leverage this?One of the first things we did was leverage the VulnHub submissions and made some of them free machines on our ‘PG Play’ tier.To practice with those machines, you had to download it onto your hardware. To make it easier, we hosted them on our servers, so all you need is a browser to practice. We also supplied hints and walkthroughs.VulnHub and Exploit Database, another open source project that has the most publicly disclosed exploits, are great resources and we'll continue to invest in both.What's on the agenda for the rest of 2021?You’re going to see new content in a variety of different ways. We will continue to scale and reach more students, [with a wider range of] backgrounds and learning preferences.And we continue to innovate on how to work well as a 100% distributed company during a tough time – just last week we had a sleep expert talk to us about the importance of sleep [for instance].You really have to trust your employees and give them the flexibility to allow life and work to commingle. When they are happy with their life, everything else takes care of itself.READ MORE Censys: How a university project became a major commercial security platform",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/in-security-every-problem-is-different-offensive-securitys-ning-wang-on-training-the-next-generation-of-infosec-pros,"['Education', 'Interviews', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Windows', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Compliance', 'Certification', 'Coronavirus', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Linux']"
no,Brave browser’s Tor feature found to leak .onion queries to ISPs,Developers are issuing hotfix,"UPDATED Brave, the privacy-focused web browser, is exposing users’ activity on Tor’s hidden servers – aka the ‘dark web’ – to their internet service providers, it has been confirmed.Brave is shipped with a built-in feature that integrates the Tor anonymity network into the browser, providing both security and privacy features that can help obscure a user’s activity on the web.Tor is also used to access .onion websites, which are hosted on the dark net.Earlier today (February 19), a blog post from ‘Rambler’ claimed that Brave was leaking DNS requests made in the Brave browser to a user’s ISP.Read more of the latest privacy newsDNS requests are unencrypted, meaning that any requests to access .onion sites using the Tor feature in Brave can be tracked – a direct contradiction to its purpose in the first place.The blog post reads: “Your ISP or DNS provider will know that a request made to a specific Tor site was made by your IP. With Brave, your ISP would know that you accessed somesketchyonionsite.onion.”Following the disclosure, well-known security researchers including PortSwigger Web Security’s James Kettle independently verified the issue using the Wireshark packet analysis tool.“I just confirmed that yes, Brave browsers Tor mode appear to leak all the .onion addresses you visit to your DNS provider,” Kettle tweeted, providing a screenshot for evidence.Security researcher James Kettle independently verified the Brave browser privacy issueUser responseConsidering that the Tor Browser was specifically built to hide a users’ internet browsing from their ISP, the news has provoked a vociferous response online.“Privacy my ass,” wrote Twitter user @s_y_m_f_m, while other called the findings “appalling”.The issue has been present in the stable release since November 2020, and was reported “in mid January”, a Brave developer told The Daily Swig.A fix has since been issued and is available for download here.INSIGHT Tor security: Everything you need to know about the anonymity networkA spokesperson for Brave told The Daily Swig: “In mid-January 2021, we were made aware of a bug that would allow a network attacker to see DNS requests that were made in a private window in Brave with Tor connectivity.“The root cause was a new adblocking feature called CNAME adblocking which initiated DNS requests that did not go through Tor in order to check if a domain should be blocked.“This bug was discovered and reported by xiaoyinl on HackerOne. We responded immediately to the report and included a fix for this vulnerability in the February 4, 2021 in the nightly update.“As is our usual process for bug fixes, we have been testing the changes in nightly to make sure that they didn't cause regressions or other bugs before releasing to the stable channel.”They added: “We encourage people to continue to report bugs like this on HackerOne so we can fix them as quickly as possible.“We also want to remind our community that using a private window with Tor connectivity through Brave is not the same as using the Tor Browser.“If your personal safety depends on remaining anonymous, we highly recommend using Tor Browser instead of Brave Tor windows.”This article has been updated to include comment from Brave and further information.

yes,BIND implements DNS-over-HTTPS to offer enhanced privacy,DNS server technology gets experimental upgrade,"Developers of the widely used, open source BIND DNS server software have added preliminary support for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to the technology.Support for DoH has been added to the BIND 9 nameserver 9.17.10, a development version of the technology. A backport to the stable (mainstream) is 9.16.x, planned after the current build dependency on the nghttp2 library is made optional.RELATED A guide to DNS-over-HTTPS – How a new web protocol aims to protect your privacy onlineNeeding DoHDoH is a foundational technology for building greater privacy into surfing the web and other activities on the internet. Application of the DoH protocol involves enclosing DNS traffic inside HTTPS packets.This layer of encryption guards against snooping on the websites consumers are visiting, blocking some aspects of ad tracking as well as protecting against message modification – a benefit in defending against manipulator in the middle (MitM) attacks.DoH is also a stepping stone in the deployment of Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), a technology that encrypts the handshake between clients TLS servers so that sensitive metadata is kept secret.Read more of the latest privacy newsBIND – which is developed by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) – already supports DNS-over-TLS (DoT), an alternative to DoH that offers similar privacy-enhancing benefits.Following the latest (experimental or prototype) release, a BIND server can accept conventional DNS queries as well as those based on either DoT or DoH.“Which transport is used for an individual client query depends on what the client uses to contact BIND,” a blog post by the ISC explains. “Starting from this release we have a specialised HTTP/2 server built into BIND specifically to serve DNS-over-HTTPS queries.”Server-side onlyBIND’s support for DoH remains server-side only at present, though work on client side technology is already underway. The server-side release was tested using Mozilla Firefox among other DoH clients.The DoH implementation from BIND already boasts some unique features including the ability to offload TLS encryption to another server.BIND’s blog post goes on to explain the benefits of this feature as well as how to set up DNS-over-HTTPS using its technology. The post also offers a good summary of the overall benefits of DoH as well as dealing with some of the criticisms of the technology.And another thing…The latest BIND release for developers also includes a fix for a buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2020-8625).BIND’s implementation of SPNEGO, a negotiation mechanism used by GSSAPI, the application protocol interface for GSS-TSIG, is flawed.The vulnerability creates a mechanism to crash the process and, although unproven, the possibility to trigger remote code execution.“Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers,” ISC advises.GSS-TSIG is an extension to the TSIG protocol that designed to support the secure exchange of keys.Users are advised to upgrade to the patched release most closely related to your current version of BIND, such as BIND 9.11.28 or BIND 9.16.12.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Encrypted Client Hello: Upcoming Firefox 85 rollout builds momentum for ESNI successor",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/bind-implements-dns-over-https-to-offer-enhanced-privacy,"['DNS', 'Encryption', 'Privacy', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'MitM', 'Industry', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities']"
no,CDPA: Virginia’s new Consumer Data Protection Act heralds start of another busy year for US privacy legislators,"Soon-to-be enacted privacy bill will go further to protect Virginia residents, writes attorney David Oberly","UPDATE Governor Ralph Northam signed the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act into law on March 2. The law will go into effect on January 1, 2023.ANALYSIS State legislatures wasted no time in the beginning of 2021, introducing a myriad of privacy bills aimed at providing greater regulation over the collection and use of consumers’ sensitive personal data.Virginia sped through the legislative process after introducing its Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) at the start of the year, the first consumer privacy bill passed into law in 2021.With the CDPA, Virginia would become the second state in the nation to put in place a comprehensive consumer privacy law. It follows California’s 2018 enactment of its game-changing California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect in early 2020.Importantly, the overwhelming support received for the enactment of the CDPA provides a strong indication that 2021 may bring with it greater regulation over the use of consumer data across the US.Who is impacted by Virginia’s CDPA?The CDPA applies to any entity that conducts business in Virginia or produces products or services targeted to Virginia resident, and either controls/processes the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers, or controls/processes the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and derives over 50% of its gross revenue from the sale of personal data.The CDPA classifies entities that process personal data as “controllers” and “processors”, and mandates different requirements for each. Controllers are those entities that determine the purpose and means of processing personal data, while processors merely process data on behalf of a controller.Read more of the latest data privacy newsWhat counts as ‘personal data’?‘Personal data’ in this instance means any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person.Importantly, the CDPA classifies certain types of data as ‘sensitive data’, which are subject to additional requirements and restrictions not applicable to other types of personal data.Under the law, ‘sensitive data’ includes: biometric data; precise geolocation data; data of minor children; and data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual orientation, or citizenship or immigration status.Consumer rightsThe CDPA affords consumers five fundamental rights:Access: The right to confirm whether a controller is processing the consumer’s data, and access to such data.Portability: The right to receive data that the consumer previously provided to the controller in a portable and readily-usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hinderance.Opt-out: The right to opt out of the processing of personal data for targeted advertising, certain profiling activities, and “sales” (as defined by the CDPA as the exchange of personal data for monetary consideration by the controller to a third party).Correction: The right to correct inaccurate personal data.Deletion: The right to delete personal data concerning the consumer.BACKGROUND CCPA regulations go live, ushering in tighter data privacy controls for California residentsLike the CCPA, the CDPA requires controllers to comply with consumer rights requests, including informing the consumer of any action taken in response to a request, within 45 to 90 days of receiving a request from a consumer.To facilitate consumer requests, controllers must also establish one or more means for consumers to submit requests to exercise their consumer rights, as well as an internal appeals process for consumers to challenge refusals to take action in response to their requests.Privacy noticesAlso like the CCPA, the CDPA requires controllers to provide notice to consumers containing, at a minimum, the following information: the categories of data processed; the purposes for processing such data; how consumers can exercise their CDPA rights; the categories of data shared with third parties; and the categories of third parties with whom the controller shares personal data.Virginia’s CDPA is expected to come into effect in 2023Data security measuresControllers must first obtain consumer consent before processing any sensitive consumer data, as well as before processing data that is not reasonably necessary or different from the purposes originally disclosed to the consumer.Controllers must maintain reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data that are appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue.Significantly, the CDPA requires controllers to complete data protection assessments (DPA) with respect to certain processing activities. The DPA must identify and weigh the benefits flowing from the processing of personal data against the associated potential risks to the rights of consumers, and may be restricted in engaging in some processing activities depending on the outcome of the assessment.Read more of the latest cybersecurity news from the USProcesser obligationsThe CDPA also sets forth a range of requirements for processors of personal data, which include entering into a written contracts with controllers that set out the instructions to which the processor is bound, assisting controllers with fulfilling their obligations to respond to consumer requests, deleting or returning personal data to a controller upon request, and maintaining reasonable security procedures and practices to protect personal data.Liability and enforcementFortunately for organizations that handle the data of Virginia consumers, the CDPA does not provide a private right of action for individuals to pursue litigation against entities for alleged violations of the law.Rather, enforcement authority rests exclusively with the Virginia attorney general.Companies that violate the CDPA can be subjected to civil penalties of up to $7,500 for “each violation” of the law.Importantly, however, the CDPA includes a cure provision that provides the opportunity for companies to avoid enforcement actions if all violations are corrected within 30 days after receiving notice of non-compliance.Compliance tipsWhile it is almost certain that the CDPA will be enacted in the immediate future, the law will not go into effect until January 1, 2023.With that said, companies should still nonetheless begin to take proactive action at this time to enhance their data privacy programs, especially as other states continue their concerted campaign to enact consumer privacy laws of their own in 2021.In particular, organizations should consider implementing the following actions:Complete a data mapping and inventory exerciseImplement a publicly-available privacy policyProvide written notice to all individuals at or before the time personal data is collectedDesign and implement processes and procedures for responding to consumer requestsImplement data security measures to protect and secure personal dataComplete a data protection assessmentConsult with experienced privacy counsel to ensure compliance with today’s constantly-evolving privacy legal landscape.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE US Supreme Court hears Van Buren appeal arguments in light of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ambiguity",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cdpa-virginias-new-consumer-data-protection-act-heralds-start-of-another-busy-year-for-us-privacy-legislators,"['US', 'Privacy', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Legal', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Government', 'Analysis', 'Biometrics']"
no,Security researchers warn of critical zero-day flaws in ‘age gap’ dating app Gaper,‘We identified that it was possible to compromise any account on the application within a 10-minute timeframe’,"Critical zero-day vulnerabilities in Gaper, an ‘age gap’ dating app, could be exploited to compromise any user account and potentially extort users, security researchers claim.The absence of access controls, brute-force protection, and multi-factor authentication in the Gaper app mean attackers could potentially exfiltrate sensitive personal data and use that data to achieve full account takeover within just 10 minutes.More worryingly still, the attack did not leverage “0-day exploits or advanced techniques and we would not be surprised if this had not been previously exploited in the wild”, said UK-based Ruptura InfoSecurity in a technical write-up published yesterday (February 17).Despite the apparent gravity of the threat, researchers said Gaper failed to respond to multiple attempts to contact them via email, their only support channel.GETting personal dataGaper, which launched in the summer of 2019, is a dating and social networking app aimed at people seeking a relationship with younger or older men or women.Ruptura InfoSecurity says the app has around 800,000 users, mostly based in the UK and US.Because certificate pinning was not enforced, the researchers said it was possible to obtain a manipulator-in-the-middle (MitM) position through the use of a Burp Suite proxy.This enabled them to snoop on “HTTPS traffic and easily enumerate functionality”.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsThe researchers then set up a fake user profile and used a GET request to access the ‘info’ function, which revealed the user’s session token and user ID.This allows an authenticated user to query any other user’s data, “providing they know their user_id value” – which is easily guessed since this value is “simply incremented by one each time a new user is created”, said Ruptura InfoSecurity.“An attacker could iterate through the user_id’s to retrieve an extensive list of sensitive information that could be used in further targeted attacks against all users,” including “email address, date of birth, location and even gender orientation”, they continued.Alarmingly, retrievable data is also said to include user-uploaded images, which “are stored within a publicly accessible, unauthenticated database – potentially leading to extortion-like situations”.Covert brute-forcingArmed with a list of user email addresses, the researchers opted against launching a brute-force attack against the login function, as this “could have potentially locked every user of the application out, which would have caused a huge amount of noise…”.Instead, security shortcomings in the forgotten password API and a requirement for “only a single authentication factor” offered a more discrete path “to a complete compromise of arbitrary user accounts”.The password change API responds to valid email addresses with a 200 OK and an email containing a four-digit PIN number sent to the user to enable a password reset.Observing a lack of rate limiting protection, the researchers wrote a tool to automatically “request a PIN number for a valid email address” before rapidly sending requests to the API containing various four-digit PIN permutations.Public disclosureIn their attempt to report the issues to Gaper, the security researchers sent three emails to the company, on November 6 and 12, 2020, and January 4, 2021.Having received no response within 90 days, they publicly disclosed the zero-days in line with Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy.“Advice to users would be to disable their accounts and ensure that the applications they use for dating and other sensitive actions are suitably secure (at least with 2FA),” Tom Heenan, managing director of Ruptura InfoSecurity, told The Daily Swig.As of today (February 18), Gaper has still not responded, he added.The Daily Swig has also contacted Gaper for comment and will update the article if and when we hear back.RELATED Grindr fined $10m for ‘grave’ GDPR violations by Norwegian privacy watchdog",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-researchers-warn-of-critical-zero-day-flaws-in-age-gap-dating-app-gaper,"['Zero-day', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Mobile', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'MitM', 'Privacy', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Authentication', 'Passwords', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Social', 'Media', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Research', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security']"
no,IT services firm Centreon downplays reports of backdoor software vulnerabilities linked to Russian hacking group Sandstorm,Company says victims were using outdated versions of its monitoring software,"French IT monitoring company Centreon has downplayed reports of backdoor vulnerabilities in its open source software that were allegedly linked to Sandworm, a Russian hacking group.France’s National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) released a report (PDF) this week (February 15) detailing how several French corporate entities have been impacted by vulnerabilities in Centreon’s eponymous open source IT monitoring product.ANSSI reported that the software contained two backdoors that have impacted several customers for as long as three years.However, the vendor has massively downplayed the issue, which it says is only present on outdated versions of its open source infrastructure monitoring product.‘Misleading’In response to ANSSI’s, Centreon said the report “could mislead individuals to believe that the solutions provided by Centreon would present security flaws”.Centreon said that the flaws were present in obsolete software versions, and in a statement appeared to distance itself by stressing that only users who did not upgrade their builds weren’t protected.It also said that none of its customers had been impacted by the malicious hacking campaign, and that it did not propagate any malicious code.YOU MAY LIKE Centris: New tool helps prevent software supply chain attacks by flagging modified open source componentsThe statement reads: “The ANSSI report and our exchanges with them confirm that Centreon did not distribute or contribute to propagate malicious code.“This is not a supply chain type attack and no parallel with other attacks of this type can be made in this case.”Sandworm linksThe cyber agency, however, believes the campaign could be linked to Sandworm, a group of Russian hackers blamed for blackouts across Ukraine and the 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony cyber-attack.A report reads: “On compromised systems, ANSSI discovered the presence of a backdoor in the form of a webshell dropped on several Centreon servers exposed to the internet. This backdoor was identified as being the P.A.S. webshell, version number 3.1.4.“On the same servers, ANSSI found another backdoor identical to one described by ESET and named Exaramel.“This campaign bears several similarities with previous campaigns attributed to the intrusion set named Sandworm.”Combined, the two vulnerabilities could allow for complete takeover of the software, which could enable hackers to move laterally across a victim’s network.Further technical details can be found in the ANSSI report (PDF).Read more of the latest cyber-attack newsANSSI also released a number of recommendations to protect against the campaign, including keeping all software up to date and limiting the external exposure of IT monitoring systems.“Monitoring systems such as Centreon need to be highly intertwined with the monitored information system and therefore are a prime target for intrusion sets seeking lateralisation,” the report reads.“It is recommended either not to expose these tools’ web interfaces to [the] internet or to restrict such access using non-applicative authentication (TLS client certificate, basic authentication on the web server).”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE SQLite patches use-after-free bug that left apps open to code execution, denial-of-service exploits",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/it-services-firm-centreon-downplays-reports-of-backdoor-software-vulnerabilities-linked-to-russian-hacking-group-sandstorm,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Russia', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Secure', 'Development', 'France', 'Europe', 'Government', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Network', 'Security', 'Research', 'Malware']"
no,From ‘Forbes 30 under 30’ to jail – Nigerian phishing fraudster gets 10 years in US prison,Obinwanne Okeke sentenced for masterminding transatlantic BEC scam,"A Nigerian national has been jailed in the US for 10 years after he was convicted of masterminding a long-running business email compromise (BEC) scam that grossed an estimated $11 million.Obinwanne Okeke, 33, operated a group of companies known as the Invictus Group based in Nigeria and elsewhere.From approximately 2015 to 2019, Okeke and his cohorts systematically scammed hundreds of victims through a fraud that relied on hacking into the email accounts of prospective marks.Compromised access to corporate email accounts was used to message victims with targeted instructions on how to make payments into accounts controlled by the fraudsters on a variety of pretexts, such as payments for fictitious invoices.INSIGHT A guide to spear-phishing – how to protect against targeted attacksOne particularly successful BEC scheme targeting the chief finance officer of Unatrac Holding Limited, the export sales office for Caterpillar heavy industrial and farm equipment, as a US Department of Justice (DoJ) statement on the case explains:In April 2018, a Unatrac executive fell prey to a phishing email that allowed conspirators to capture login credentials. The conspirators sent fraudulent wire transfer requests and attached fake invoices.Okeke participated in the effort to victimize Unatrac through fraudulent wire transfers totalling nearly $11 million, which was transferred overseas.Okeke also engaged in other forms of cyber-fraud, including “sending phishing emails to capture email credentials, creating fraudulent web pages, and causing other losses to numerous victims”, according to the DoJ.Invictus gamesUp until his arrest by the FBI in August 2019, Okeke was seen as an entrepreneur with investments in a wide variety of sectors including oil and gas, alternative energy, telecoms, agriculture, construction and real estate.These assets were held by Invictus Group, which operated in Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia.Okeke was named on the Forbes Africa 30 under 30 list in recognition of his supposed entrepreneurial achievements on the continent and in no doubt partial recognition of his inspiring backstory, as relayed by Forbes:Okeke could not fail his mother. A promise meant hard work and dreaming big. He was raised in Ukpor village, 790 kilometers from Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, as the 17th child of a polygamous father.??He went to boarding school aged 10, lost his father at 16, and moved from one relative to another.??He named his company Invictus after one of Nelson Mandela’s favorite poems by William Ernest Henley, about the undefeated and unconquerable soul of a hard worker from an impoverished background who will not give up.Awards for the Invictus Group itself followed, as well as community charities (Invictus Foundation scholarships), and a profile by the BBC’s Focus on Africa program.All that fell apart after Okeke was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport while leaving the US, and days after a warrant for his arrest was put together in August 2019.Read more of the latest cybercrime news from around the worldHe was quickly charged with two counts of computer fraud and wire fraud and remanded in custody.Follow the arrest, a Nigerian court froze Invictus Obi’s local bank accounts.After initially contesting the charges, Okeke admitted his guilt as part of a plea bargaining deal agreed last year.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/from-forbes-30-under-30-to-jail-nigerian-phishing-fraudster-gets-10-years-in-us-prison,"['Cybercrime', 'Fraud', 'Phishing', 'Email', 'Security', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Africa', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Legal', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Organizations']"
no,Centris: New tool helps prevent software supply chain attacks by flagging modified open source components,"Tackling vulnerability propagation and license violation, one scan at a time","Centris, a new tool developed by a global team of researchers from Korea University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, is designed to make the reuse of open source software components more manageable and secure.Centris uses a novel approach to track open source components in software projects, even when the integration is partial and under a modified structure. It has already managed to root out old vulnerabilities in hundreds of GitHub projects, the developers say.The DevSecOps-friendly tool was introduced in a paper on the arXiv preprint server earlier this month and will be presented at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) conference later this year.The challenges of managing open source softwareThe reuse of open source software (OSS) has many advantages, including slashing the time of software development and opening applications up to public scrutiny, which can help improve security.OSS reuse, however, does have its own challenges, especially when components are not used in their original form.Many programs integrate part of an OSS project or use OSS components in a nested format, where one component contains part of another open source project.To further add to the complication, some developers change the file name and hierarchy of the open source projects they integrate into their code. All this makes it hard to keep track of changes in OSS components.RELATED Dependency confusion: Researcher hacks major tech companies in novel supply chain attack“We discovered that modified OSS reuse accounts for 95% of the total OSS reuse in the popular OSS ecosystem,” Seunghoon Woo, lead author of the Centris paper, told The Daily Swig.Traditional tools used for managing OSS elements in software projects generally miss modified components because they assume the code is being used in its original form. Other tools that use code cloning detection techniques, however, generate too many false positives.“Approaches that considered only unmodified OSS components resulted in missing many modified components (i.e., low recall), or misinterpreted that an OSS, which was actually not reused, was a component (i.e., low precision),” Woo said.Open source security issuesLosing track of OSS dependencies can quickly become a serious security problem. When a vulnerability crops up in an untracked OSS component it tends to remain in an application for a long time.For instance, the researchers found that Godot Engine, a GitHub project with more than 36,000 stars, was reusing a single file from an open source JPEG-compressor that had a vulnerability with a 7.8 CVSS score dating back to 2017.According to the researchers, the exploit “could be reproduced by simply uploading a malicious image file to the Godot project”. And since Godot was using a single file from the JPEG-compressor project, OSS dependency trackers didn’t spot the dependency and vulnerability.“As another example, NMAP reused PCRE with modification, and this modified PCRE has not been properly managed and updated for over 10 years,” Woo said.Centris: A new way to detect OSS modificationCentris has a component database, which is composed of functions extracted from more than 10,000 GitHub repositories and spanning more than 80 billion lines of code.All versions of the projects are processed and distilled to eliminate redundancies and minimize the required space to store the functions.Centris uses this database to spot reused OSS functions and their respective versions in target projects. This granular approach allows Centris to identify OSS components in software projects regardless of whether all or parts of the codebase are reused.According to the researchers, Centris can identify reused OSS components with 91% precision and 94% recall, even when modified OSS reuse is prominent.Centris aims to help solve the ‘dependency problem’ by detecting reused open source components“Centris discovered that 572 OSS projects contain at least one other vulnerable OSS component. Among them, 27 OSS projects are still reusing the vulnerable OSS in their latest version,” the researchers wrote in their paper.Improving vulnerability detectionWoo told The Daily Swig that Centris can be an effective solution to vulnerability propagation and license violation.It can also help the mitigation of software supply chain attacks, in which hackers spread malicious payloads through legitimate software distribution channels.For instance, if attackers manage to upload malicious code into an OSS repository, the vulnerability will be propagated to all software projects that depend on it.INSIGHT Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowIf developers clearly identify and manage the components being reused in their software, a goal that Centris pursues, they will be able to cope with supply chain attacks much faster and more efficiently, Woo says.Doubling downIn the future, the researchers are considering adding more security features to Centris. “We are considering a way to provide alerts when a new vulnerability is detected (this can be checked through crawling public vulnerability database information) in components identified by Centris,” Woo says.The researchers also plan to combine Centris with VUDDY, another vulnerable code detection method they developed in 2017. This will enable developers to resolve vulnerability propagation problems more efficiently, Woo says.Finally, the researchers are planning to integrate Centris with a soon-to-launch vulnerability detection platform.“We plan to provide a public open web service of Centris for free in an automated vulnerability analysis platform soon, so that anyone can identify the components in their software freely to eliminate the potential threats before using open-source software,” Woo says.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/centris-new-tool-helps-prevent-software-supply-chain-attacks-by-flagging-modified-open-source-components,"['Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'US', 'Asia', 'North', 'America', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'GitHub', 'Events', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Malware']"

no,"SQLite patches use-after-free bug that left apps open to code execution, denial-of-service exploits","More than one trillion SQLite databases potentially active in myriad operating systems, browsers, and applications","UPDATED SQLite has issued a security patch after the discovery of a use-after-free bug that, if triggered, could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service (DoS).The highest threat to systems running affected versions of SQLite, a C-language library that implements an SQL database engine, is to system availability, according to a Red Hat Bugzilla thread.However, the flaw is only marked as medium severity because exploitation depends on attackers already having “access to query the data in the database”, noted Todd Cullum, senior product security engineer at Red Hat, an open source software vendor.Richard Hipp, who launched the SQLite project in 2000 and remains its architect, didn’t think the vulnerability posed a serious threat.If an SQL injection bug exists on a target system then it might be possible – dependent on other protections in place – to cause SQLite to read a previously freed data structure and potentially cause a crash, he told The Daily Swig. “More likely, it will just cause SQLite to return a goofy answer.”As a read – rather than write – after free bug, “there are no known paths to an RCE”, he added. “So really, this problem allows an attacker to escalate an SQL injection vulnerability in the application into a denial of service.”But in that case, “the attacker already has a more trivial denial of service by simply sending in a (well-formed) SQL statement that runs forever. So it isn’t clear that this bug gives an attacker any new capabilities.”Vast attack surfaceIf the impact of the vulnerability is described as moderate, then surely few other applications present such an enormous attack surface.Open source SQLite “is likely used more than all other database engines combined”, claims the SQLite website, which estimates the number of active SQLite databases at more than one trillion.Catch up on the latest security vulnerability newsThe relational database management system is built into all 3.5 billion active smartphones, as well as all Apple Macs and Windows 10 machines; Firefox, Chrome, and Safari web browsers; Skype, iTunes, and Dropbox; and most smart TVs, among many more applications.Inti De Ceukelaire, head of hackers at bug bounty platform Intigriti, told The Daily Swig that the bug’s moderate severity might instil a false sense of security into some vendors.“The problem with these kind of medium severity vulnerabilities is that vendors will often not consider fixing it until real-world impact is shown,” he explains. “This is a highly contextual vulnerability that would only work in specific situations.“Therefore, I do not expect that vendors will make breaking changes in order to mitigate this vulnerability, which could potentially lead to chained attacks of unpatched systems in the future.”WHERE the flaw was foundFound in SQLite’s SELECT query functionality (src/select.c), the issue arose because of a “problem handling sub-queries with both a correlated WHERE clause and a ‘HAVING 0’ clause where the parent query is itself an aggregate”, according to a vulnerability alert published by Ubuntu, the Linux distribution, on February 5.The problem was apparently introduced by a code change implemented in June 2020.Todd Cullum of Red Hat expanded on this analysis: “The WHERE clause (a=2), uses an aggregate column from the outer query.“If the HAVING term (0) is moved into the WHERE clause in this case, SQLite would at one point optimize (a=2 AND 0) to simply (0). Which is logically correct, but happened to cause problems in aggregate processing for the outer query.”Updates and recommendationsThe security flaw, which affects the SQLite 3 release line, was first flagged in an SQLite bug tracker on January 19, then patched the following day in version 3.341 on January 20.The issue (CVE-2021-20227) was resolved by adding “the ExprAlwaysFalse(pExpr)==0 check to the if statement before the business logic in havingToWhereExprCb() in file src/select.c,” according to Cullum.Ubuntu updated its software accordingly on February 11, while the latest versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux – 6, 7, and 8 – are unaffected as they run SQLite versions that predate the commit that introduced the bug.A security bulletin issued by AUSCert (Australia’s Computer Emergency Response Team), confirmed that the flaw is exploitable on Ubuntu, Windows, UNIX, Linux, and OSX operating systems.“Even though there are no known vulnerabilities due to this bug, it does come close to being an opportunity to escalate an SQLi into something more serious, so it is still good to upgrade, if only for defense-in-depth,” said Richard Hipp of SQLite.This article was updated on January 16 with comments from Richard Hipp and Inti De Ceukelaire.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Measuring risk: Organizations urged to choose defense-in-depth over CVE whack-a-mole",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/sqlite-patches-use-after-free-bug-that-left-apps-open-to-code-execution-denial-of-service-exploits,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Windows', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Secure', 'Development', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'RCE', 'Australia', 'Oceania', 'Industry', 'News', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Organizations']"
no,Measuring risk: Organizations urged to choose defense-in-depth over CVE whack-a-mole,"The number of critical security vulnerabilities reached a record high in 2020, but sysadmins have been warned against focusing solely on high-scoring CVEs in their patch process","Organizations should look beyond CVSS scores when evaluating the threat posed by security vulnerabilities, according to a new report.Based on an analysis of more than 18,000 vulnerabilities logged by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2020, security firm Redscan says it’s important to take so-called ‘low-risk’ vulnerabilities seriously.More security vulnerabilities were disclosed in 2020 than ever before, with an average rate of 50 CVEs per day.BACKGROUND CVE program marks 20th anniversary as registered security vulnerabilities soarOverall, Redscan found that 57% of these were classified as being ‘critical’ or ‘high’ severity under the widely used Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) – and, understandably, it tends to be these that receive the most attention from security teams.However, the number of low complexity CVEs is on the rise, amounting to 63% of vulnerabilities disclosed in 2020.And, says Redscan, many high-severity vulnerabilities are never actually exploited in the real world because they are too complex, or require attackers to have access to high level privileges.Risky business“Just because a vulnerability is classified as high severity doesn’t necessarily mean that it presents any greater risk than one that is medium severity,” George Glass, Redscan’s head of threat intelligence, tells The Daily Swig.“Defence in depth in vitally important, and this is also true when deciding which vulnerabilities to patch, for example a low-scoring exploit on and internet facing appliance could pose a greater risk than a higher scoring vulnerability which would take a much more skilled adversary to exploit.”INSIGHT CNAs and CVEs – Can allowing vendors to assign their own vulnerability IDs actually hinder security?Meanwhile, low risk flaws can be chained, making them more dangerous than might immediately be apparent.“For example, one vulnerability could provide an attacker with a low privilege shell on a host,” says Glass.“The attacker could then move on to exploit another vulnerability to allow them to become root or perform lateral movement and achieve their real objectives, whether that’s installing ransomware or stealing data.”The weakest linkDuring the course of last year, Redscan saw several examples of chaining vulnerabilities in edge networking technology. These included Fortinet and MobileIron devices with the Zerologon vulnerability, which allowed threat actors to pivot from a low privilege account on the network edge to obtain administrator access to an entire domain.But rather more reassuringly for security teams, Redscan found a drop in the percentage of vulnerabilities which require no user privileges to exploit – down from 71% in 2016 to 58% in 2020.Meanwhile, Edgescan's Vulnerability Stats Report reveals that nearly two thirds of the CVEs it found in 2020 were more than three years old, with half of those dating back to 2015 or before.“Malware is exploiting common old vulnerabilities, which could easily be patched,” says the firm.Read more of the latest security industry newsGlass urges caution when using automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify security flaws, warning that without the full context they can give a misleading picture.“To aid decision-making, security teams need a practical understanding of the potential impact vulnerabilities pose and information about how readily they are being exploited in the wild,” he says.“A key way for organisations to improve vulnerability management is to keep up with what’s happening in the threat landscape and use this information to help prioritise the specific vulnerabilities that present the greatest risk to their own organisation at any point in time.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/measuring-risk-organizations-urged-to-choose-defense-in-depth-over-cve-whack-a-mole,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Industry', 'News', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Zero-day', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Research', 'Analysis', 'Browsers', 'IoT', 'Hardware', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Authentication', 'Organizations', 'Enterprise', 'Malware', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software']"
No,UK cryptocurrency exchange EXMO knocked offline by ‘massive’ DDoS attack,Services halted by unknown attacker,"Cryptocurrency exchange EXMO has been knocked offline by a “massive” DDoS attack, the UK-based company has confirmed.The exchange said it suffered a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assault yesterday (February 15), when its website was unavailable for two hours.EXMO said that it experienced an unusual amount of traffic at 16.10 GMT, with the number of connections temporarily disrupting its activity.Read more of the latest DDoS attack newsA spokesperson for EXMO told The Daily Swig that while previous DDoS attacks had affected only the website, this “massive attack” – which drove 30 GB of traffic per second – affected “the whole network infrastructure, including the website, API, Websocket API, and exchange charts”.The spokesperson added: “So, it’s quite natural for any exchange to be down under these circumstances. The attack was repelled with the help of DDoS protection Qurator. We are now also taking additional security measures.“EXMO resumed its work yesterday. So basically, we were down just for a couple of hours.“Unfortunately, with a splash in market activity, which undoubtedly drives a positive change, many negative phenomena are back as well.

The cryptocurrency exchange is looking to determine the culprit behind the incident.The EXMO website was still offline on February 16Multiple attacksThis news follows another security incident on December 21, 2020, which saw attackers steal around $4 million in cryptocurrency from EXMO.Malicious hackers took an estimated 6% of the exchange’s assets. The funds were withdrawn through exchange Poloniex, and therefore cannot be returned.EXMO temporarily suspended withdrawals and deposits, it explained in a security update.The company also said it had reported to incident to UK police and the National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC).READ Hackers demand $34.7 million in Bitcoin after ransomware attack on FoxconnEXMO said at the time: “We have completely separate server infrastructure for cryptocurrency wallets and all other platform data (production servers). The hack didn’t affect the production server. All information about transactions and clients also remained out of reach for the hackers.“At this moment, we did checks for all the logs on compromised cryptocurrency servers. As a result, we assume that the hacker got the private keys.

no,Joker’s Stash closure kicks off competition for a successor,"Market for stolen payment cards will persist, threat intel firm predicts","UPDATED The largest illicit marketplace for stolen payment card data, Joker’s Stash, officially shut down today (February 15).Threat intel experts at Flashpoint predict one of four contenders will step in to fill the vacuum left by the site’s departure from the cybercrime scene.Joker’s Stash closed on schedule, 30 days after its founder announced he was pulling down the shutters on the cybercrime bazaar.BACKGROUND Joker’s Stash demise likely to spawn growth to rival cybercrime forumsIncreased law enforcement scrutiny hastened the marketplace’s demise but not the illicit business model it mined, according to a white paper from Flashpoint.The security firm reckons four cybercrime marketplaces are primed to become the leading exponent of the Joker’s Stash model: Brian’s Club, Ferum, Trump’s Dumps and Yale Lodge.WildcardJoker’s Stash, the longest running stolen payment card shop, launched in 2014 in the wake of several major credit card breaches and the success of other illicit stores such as Silk Road.It successfully sold credit card details stolen from various data breaches for just over six years. Since 2017 the site has hosted shops and associated infrastructure via blockchain DNS, which according to one operator “is perfect bcoz its impossible to abuse and it’s fully resistant to domain locks”.Joker’s Stash operated as a kind of blackmarket equivalent of eBay or Amazon Marketplace, taking a cut of sales proceeds generated by third party vendors.Its unidentified operator may have amassed a fortune of more than $1 billion in Bitcoin, according to an analysis by cryptocurrency technology provider Elliptic.Elliptic reports that the site became inaccessible more than a week ago, some time before its scheduled closure, in a development that annoyed some of its customers.“Joker’s Stash announced that it would cease operations on 15th February, although the site became inaccessible as of the 3rd February, angering many customers, who still had balances to spend,” said the company. “It is one of the few criminal marketplaces to shut down on its own terms, a victim of its own success rather than as a result of any apparent law enforcement operation.”Flashpoint confirmed that the Joker's Stash effectively closed on February 4, nearly two weeks ahead of schedule, a day after ""spokesperson for Joker's Stash card shop across various Russian and English-forums deleted the threads that they have used for communication with their customers and for announcements of upcoming updates"".The shop itself has remained unreachable since February 4.Catch up on the latest cybercrime newsJoker’s Stash appeared to scale back its operations in July 2020 with a noticeable decline in both the quality and response time of its customer support. Numerous theories emerged to explain the drop-off that included possible law enforcement action, health issues of the threat actors, and even a potential exit scam. Shop operators finally announced on January 15, 2021 that it would shut down the shop for good on February 15.Enhancements to the card payment ecosystem such as improved anti-fraud technologies and the move to contactless payments are making life more difficult for carders (payment card data thieves). This will have a knock-on effect for the carding marketplaces seeking to exploit a gap in the market created by the exit of Joker’s Stash, according to Flashpoint.The threat intel firm offers a form book on the four main contenders looking to supplant Joker’s Stash:Brian’s Club: Since news of Joker’s Stash’s imminent closure broke, this platform has significantly increased advertising on carding forums and chat rooms in an attempt to attract new users. It offers extensive support to users on various forums, and has fully recovered from a breach that took down the shop in October 2019.Ferum: Ferum’s administrator maintains a long-standing presence in illicit carding communities. The shop is available on the clear web and Tor, providing easier access for entry-level cybercriminals. However, the relatively small volume of card content has limited broader scale adoption.Trump’s Dumps: This relatively new shop has increased advertising to capture the open market share left by Joker’s Stash’s absence. The shop offers a variety of services, including a self-hosted checker.Yale Lodge: A Tor and clear web card shop with a relatively high degree of customer support, as well as a self-hosted checking service.Ian Gray, director of analysis and research at Flashpoint, said: “Our insights show that what from the outside appeared to be a sudden and unexpected shutdown of Joker’s Stash was in fact a long-term decline.”He adds: “Joker’s Stash was not the first illicit card shop and it certainly won’t be the last. We know from our intelligence that at least four shops are well-positioned to capture the market share left open following Joker’s Stash’s closure.”Forums, rather than private groups on Telegram and the like will remain the main forum for the sale of stolen card data, according to Flashpoint:While Telegram supports chats and conversations, it doesn’t have a native payment system within the application. Some users may conduct peer-to-peer transactions through Telegram, however without an escrow or administrator there is a possibility that the user may be scammed.Bot services like Televend are being used in fraud and drug communities to provide automated payment systems, which provides convenience, although it lacks a shop interface.Shops like Joker’s Stash have gained the trust of their users through the release of large breaches of credit card data, and anonymous and decentralized network infrastructure (e.g., Blockchain-DNS).They have provided customer support on mid and high-tier English and Russian language forums. Furthermore, they have provided guidelines for giving out customer refunds on rejected cards that met a certain criteria.Flashpoint analysts do not foresee any major changes taking place in the structure of card shops. ""The business model on Joker’s Stash was rated highly by users across various cybercrime communities and Flashpoint analysts assess with high confidence that other card shops will attempt to replicate the model Joker’s Stash,"" it said.Flashpoint's Gray concluded: “Financial institutions [need] to remain aware of these fast-paced market changes and have the ability to quickly identify their payment products and customer data when it’s offered for sale on these illicit marketplaces.”This story has been updated with additional comment from Flashpoint.RELATED Imminent Joker’s Stash demise likely to spawn growth of rival cybercrime forums",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/jokers-stash-closure-kicks-off-competition-for-a-successor,"['Cybercrime', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Tor', 'Research', 'Fraud', 'E-Commerce', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Database', 'Security']"

no,Dax-Côte d’Argent hospital in France hit by ransomware attack,"Egregor ransomware gang involved, according to reports","A hospital in southwest France is scrambling to recover from a ransomware attack that has caused significant operational disruption.In a tweet posted on February 11, the Center Hospitalier de Dax-Côte d’Argent revealed that it had fallen prey to a cyber-attack and was trying to restore systems that included the telephone switchboard.ConvalescenceCybersecurity vendor Avast said that patient care had been impaired in a French-language blog post (Avast verified an English translation for The Daily Swig).Phone lines at the healthcare facility had been partially restored, it added, but encrypted data remained inaccessible as of February 12.The attack occurred on February 8 and continued into February 9, according to a report in French daily Sud Ouest.In a press conference held on February 11, the publication continued, senior hospital officials said staff were resorting to pen and paper, and that radiotherapy care was among the most severely disrupted departments.Catch up on the latest healthcare security newsOfficials at the hospital, which has six sites and around 1,000 beds, were quoted as saying that restoration of normal operations could be several weeks away.The Daily Swig has contacted the hospital for an update on its recovery efforts. We will update the article if we hear back.Luis Corrons, a security evangelist at Avast, has urged other hospitals to promptly deploy emergency patches for critical software vulnerabilities, train staff in “digital hygiene” best practices, “regularly back up files”, and “suspend all services directly available from the internet”.He also told The Daily Swig that “IT admins should consider strict whitelisting when it comes to executable files, so that only known and trusted applications can be run on hospital computers.”Egregor implicatedFrance Inter has reported that the attackers used the Egregor ransomware, which was first detected in the wild in September 2020 and is notable for mounting so-called ‘double-tap attacks’ that exfiltrate as well as encrypt files.Other recent Egregor victims have included US retail giant Kmart, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, and Translink, the public transport system of Vancouver in Canada.However, the group’s ability to carry out further attacks has apparently been dented after several Egregor affiliates were arrested in Ukraine last week as part of a joint operation between French and Ukrainian law enforcement – a story also broken by France Inter.DON’T FORGET TO READ Florida Healthy Kids blames health insurance data breach on third-party hackIT Wire has today noted that Egregor’s internet and dark web sites are currently down.France 3 has reported that a hospital group comprising 11 sites in Dordogne, also in southwest France, had successfully thwarted a ransomware attack after an IT supplier detected Cryptolocker malware on its servers.“Right now, hospitals are more likely to fall victim to a ransomware attack because cybercriminals can make a lot of money from targeted ransomware campaigns,” said Luis Corrons.“Also, the introduction of cyber insurance to take care of ransoms is sadly fueling this trend.”RECOMMENDED Telegram for macOS failed to self-destruct messages on local devices",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/dax-cote-dargent-hospital-in-france-hit-by-ransomware-attack,"['France', 'Ransomware', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Malware', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Healthcare', 'Privacy', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Cybercrime', 'Network', 'Security', 'Telecommunications', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Organizations', 'Encryption', 'Authentication', 'Europe', 'Dark', 'Web']"
yes,Palo Alto firewall software vulnerability quartet revealed,Researchers unveil details of security flaws in enterprise firewall technology,"UPDATED Security researchers have unveiled details of a series of flaws in Palo Alto Network’s firewall software addressed by the networking vendor last September.The swarm of four vulnerabilities covers various flaws in Palo Alto’s PAN-OS operating system that were discovered by security researchers at Positive Technologies (PT).PAN-OS is the technology behind Palo Alto Networks’ next-generation firewall (NGFW), a widely-used enterprise-grade firewall.Undesirable consequencesThe vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary OS command execution by an authorized user CVE-2020-2037 and CVE-2020-2038 – denial of service by an unauthorized user (CVE-2020-2039), and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) (CVE-2020-2036).In a technical blog post published on Thursday Positive Technologies’ Mikhail Klyuchnikov and Nikita Abramov explain how these flaws could lead to all manner of undesirable consequences.“Using these vulnerabilities, an attacker can gain access to sensitive data, disrupt the availability of firewall components or gain access to internal network segments,” the researchers warn.Catch up on the latest security vulnerability newsThe flaws were discovered during black box analysis of the firewall web management interface by the two researchers.The CVE-2020-2037 vulnerability stemmed from lack of user input filtering, while the related CVE-2020-2038 security flaw involved insufficient filtering of user inputs.Both could result in remote code execution (RCE) but each was restricted to exploitation only by pre-authorized users, reducing the overall risk.Another vulnerability allowed any unauthenticated user to conduct denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.The firewall is in built with the Nginx web server. The flaw makes it possible to upload multiple files to this server to the point that there is no remaining disc space.Without any disc space resource to make use of the Palo Alto Networks NGFW web management panel become unaccessible - effectively a denial of service since the whole device can’t be used normally in this scenario.“We tried to open the web management interface but could not log in,” the researchers explain. “Most likely, this happened because PHP failed to create a session file on disk, due to the lack of disk space available.As a result, we were able to conduct a DoS attack on Palo Alto NGFW components acting as an unauthenticated user.”‘Easily exploitable’ XSSThe fourth vulnerability involved a reflected XSS vulnerability discovered in the script /unauth/php/change_password.php.“The script makes use of the $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] variable, which is user-controlled,” the researchers explain.“This variable is inserted into an attribute value in the form tag without any filtering, thus making the XSS vulnerability easily exploitable.”All four of the vulnerabilities have been resolved but each affects different versions of PAN-OS so, short of referring readers to PT’s advisory for details, the best advice for sysadmins is to upgrade to the latest version of the supported version of the software.In response to queries from The Daily Swig, Palo Alto said customers should review the advisories it published last September (linked above). It also offered a brief comment on its engagement with researchers.The security of our customers is our top priority.In September 2020, Palo Alto Networks released patches and published security advisories for remediation.

no,Telegram for macOS failed to self-destruct messages on local devices,A vulnerability in the messaging app meant that some conversations were never actually deleted,"A security vulnerability in the macOS version of Telegram has been patched which prevented audio and video conversations set to ‘self-destruct’ from being deleted locally.The researcher who found the issue, Dhiraj Mishra, disclosed his findings on February 11. In a technical blog post, Mishra described the vulnerability as a “failure” in how the secure messaging app handles user data.Mishra first began exploring Telegram in 2018 so had a “clear idea” of how the messaging application works, he told The Daily Swig, and decided to investigate further as the app now accounts for more than 500 million active users.Fuzzy logicThe logic bug, present in Telegram for macOS 7.3’s stable release, prevented self-destructing messages from being deleted during secret chats.The macOS software leaks the MediaResourceData(path://) sandbox path when video and audio messages are sent in normal conversation boxes. If this type of content is set to self-destruct, it is still stored in either .mp4 or .mov format and remains available locally.After making a note of this local address, Mishra then examined secret chat functionality. The URL is not leaked, but recorded audio or video messages are still stored and made available by accessing the same path.RELATED Secure communication: Beleaguered Hong Kong dissidents seek refuge on ‘digital underground’Due to this logic issue, if two people, A an B, communicate using the secret chat option and A sends a message with a self-destruct timer, B could still grab this content by following the sandbox path, leading to a potential privacy failure for A.A proof-of-concept (PoC) video has been published showcasing the exploit in action:The researcher also found that Telegram for macOS stored local passcodes in plain text and without any encryption or protection in place.A JSON file can be queried to display the passcode, potentially allowing an attacker with access to a local system to read conversations on the app.Coordinated disclosureMishra initially disclosed his findings to Telegram on December 26, 2020. A reply was not received until January 6, 2021. After what the researcher describes as “a lot of follow-up emails”, the vulnerabilities were patched on January 30 in version 7.4 of the software.“In my opinion, the responsible disclosure policy for Telegram is average and can be improved,” Mishra commented.A bug bounty reward of $3,000 was awarded by Telegram.Read more of the latest Apple security newsTelegram has not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.“Telegram states it’s one of the privacy-focused messaging applications, but from my past experience, I am a little worried about using Telegram in my day-to-day activity,” Mishra told The Daily Swig.“For people already using Telegram, [they] can at least limit their conversations, but [for] people who are looking to sign up for Telegram it’s better to sign up for Signal.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/telegram-for-macos-failed-to-self-destruct-messages-on-local-devices,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Privacy', 'Research', 'Apple', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Social', 'Media', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Encryption', 'Authentication']"
No,Ukrainian citizen jailed for role in cybercrime spree that leeched $3m from US businesses,Accused recruited mules who thought they were working for a legitimate business,"A Ukrainian man has been sentenced to 87 months in jail for attempting to launder $3 million stolen from US businesses by eastern European cybercriminals.Aleksandr Musienko, 38, of Odessa, Ukraine was also ordered to pay nearly $100,000 in restitution after pleading guilty to wire fraud before a US court yesterday (February 11).Musienko’s co-conspirators are accused of hacking into businesses’ online accounts. They then used the stolen personal data to impersonate victims and withdraw substantial funds from their online bank accounts.Money mulesMusienko was involved in the recruitment and supervision of a network of so-called “money mules” who held US corporate and personal bank accounts that were used to receive stolen funds and send them overseas, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release.Using an alias, the defendant recruited mules by advertising for a financial assistant on legitimate employment websites.The mules, who by all accounts believed they were employed by a lawful business, were instructed by the defendant that their role involved helping clients to transfer funds overseas.Time waits for no scamThe DoJ said the scheme took place between 2009 and 2012.In September 2011, Musienko’s accomplices hacked into online accounts belonging to a North Carolina-based company and transferred $296,000 to two bank accounts controlled by the mules.However, when the mules, following Musienko’s instructions, attempted to wire the funds to several European bank accounts, the company’s bank detected the fraud and “deducted $197,526 from one of the mules before it was wired overseas”.Read more of the latest cybercrime news from around the worldDuring a search of Musienko’s laptop in around April 2019, the FBI found files containing around 120,000 payment card numbers and associated information that proved the accounts did not belong to the defendant.Charges were filed against Musienko in 2016, and he was arrested in South Korea in 2018 before being extradited to the US in 2019.RELATED Russian ‘security researcher’ pleads guilty to running cybercrime e-commerce platform Deer.io",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ukrainian-citizen-jailed-for-role-in-cybercrime-spree-that-leeched-3m-from-us-businesses,"['Cybercrime', 'Fraud', 'US', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Finance', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Industry', 'News', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Government', 'Legal']"
no,Secure communication: Beleaguered Hong Kong dissidents seek refuge on ‘digital underground’,"Assailed by law enforcement and APT groups, activists turn to dark web and encrypted messaging apps","Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have “turned to the digital underground” as authorities wield sweeping new surveillance powers, a new report reveals.Dissidents in the Chinese Special Administrative Region (SAR) are increasingly “using dark web forums and encrypted messaging apps to circumvent digital surveillance by authorities” empowered by a controversial new national security law, according to research by threat intel firm IntSights.Passed in June 2020, the legislation grants law enforcement agencies powers to conduct warrantless searches and covert surveillance, seize travel documents, and compel online service providers to cooperate with requests to remove content.The law was used in January to detain more than 50 pro-democracy activists and politicians, and reportedly block access to an anti-government website on the grounds that it violated separate, anti-doxxing legislation.In a multi-pronged effort to quell dissent, the Chinese government is also linked to various malware and disinformation campaigns designed to demoralize activists and disrupt their activities.For instance, when a UK-based dark web user claimed in November 2020 that at least 13 overseas websites had been blocked in Hong Kong, a pro-China counter-post blamed the incident on defective servers, reports IntSights.Last year, moreover, Twitter removed more than 170,000 accounts that were said to be part of a “manipulative and coordinated” campaign to spread disinformation about pro-democracy protests that have convulsed the SAR for the past two years.Malware and APTsAPT threat groups believed to be backed by the Chinese government have targeted Hong Kong citizens, universities, and news media deemed a threat to “unity” with malware campaigns since 2014.One iOS-optimized malware strain that emerged in 2020, LightSpy, allows an attacker to remotely exfiltrate infected devices’ call history, geolocations, and contact lists.Read more of the latest data privacy newsAn Android version, called dmsSpy, was “distributed through Instagram and Telegram with content designed to get victims to download an app dedicated to the Hong Kong Democracy and Freedom Movement”, says the report.Another, malicious archive campaign, leveraged MGbot malware linked to APT group ‘Evasive Panda’ and embedded a message from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson inviting Hong Kongers to emigrate to Britain.Going darkGrowing numbers of beleaguered activists are paying fees to use dark web services in order “to safely communicate with each other, discuss politics, share information, and inquire about newer and more secure apps through various channels available on the dark web”.Despite exercising such apparent caution, many pro-democracy netizens are nevertheless taking great risks in using generally pro-China, Chinese-language dark web forums to criticize the government and police.Moreover, the ubiquity of nefarious activities on the darknet – such as the sale of stolen data, credit card skimmers, and recreational drugs – threatens to “lure” politically motivated “users into illicit cybercriminal activity”.Un-crackable iPhonesActivists are using myriad messaging apps and communication tools to evade surveillance.These include end-to-end encrypted services Telegram, which claimed it was hit by a DDoS attack originating from China in 2019, and Signal, whose popularity has surged, according to IntSights researchers, in response to controversial changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy.Dissidents have also used Apple’s Bluetooth-powered Airdrop feature to communicate with allies and organize rallies – and the latest iPhones appear to be generally the safest bet for dissidents.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a Hong Kong police officer is quoted by IntSights researchers as stating that law enforcement were “unable to crack newer Apple iPhone models locally” despite finding “ways to compromise Android” devices and access Google Drive files.RELATED Tor security: Everything you need to know about the anonymity networkBluetooth app Bridgefy, meanwhile, is helping activists communicate offline courtesy of its innovative use of mesh networks.However, Professor Alan Woodward, a computer security expert at Surrey University, has pointed out that that authorities could still intercept communications.""With any peer-to-peer network, if you have the know-how, you can sit at central points of it and monitor which device is talking to which device and this metadata can tell you who is involved in chats,” he told the BBC in 2019.Videoconferencing platforms such as Zoom have also become a more useful eavesdropping medium for government agencies since university seminars migrated online due to the Covid-19 pandemic.IntSights expects there to be no let-up in the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to “minimize the reach and impact” of dissidents’ messages, and anticipates “a rise in VPN usage and end-to-end encryption applications, such as Signal, Telegram, and ProtonMail, and related services”.It adds: “While there was no evidence of hacktivist activities by Hong Kongers, we cannot rule out that this is happening on a small scale.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/secure-communication-beleaguered-hong-kong-dissidents-seek-refuge-on-digital-underground,"['Privacy', 'Encryption',

no,Blocked accounts abused in Evolution CMS SQL injection attacks,Details of duo of flaws in management portal made public weeks after fix,"A severe unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability has been patched by developers of the Evolution CMS.Evolution is a PHP-based, open source content management system (CMS) used to manage the backend of websites.On February 8, cybersecurity firm Synactiv publicly revealed the existence of two security flaws in the CMS and how a “blocked account” can be exploited to perform an “unauthenticated SQLi in Evolution CMS using the X-Forwarded-For header”.Written by Synacktiv’s Nicolas Biscos and Thomas Etrillard, the security advisory (PDF) details an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability on the Evolution manager login page.Read more of the latest infosec research from around the worldThis security flaw was caused by how the application processes SQL queries. If a user was to send crafted data, the query could be modified before landing in an Evolution database.As the CMS logs actions in the manager interface and inserts data into a database, the IP field is not scrubbed properly, and so the X-Forwarded-For header can be tampered with.When an account in the manager interface is blocked, a particular function is called upon which can be exploited by an attacker without authentication to extract SQL database records.A threat actor could also choose to trigger an account block, if they so choose, by issuing invalid login attempts.Time-based user enumerationThe second bug found by Synactiv also stemmed from bugs in the management interface. In order to find out if an account exists, attackers can take advantage of behavioral changes during the authentication phase.According to the researchers, “you can determine the presence of a user based on the application’s response time,” and if an account does not exist, the “full authentication process” does not take place.Combining the knowledge of an existing account, and blocking it on purpose, can then be used to trigger the SQL injection flaw.Synacktiv told The Daily Swig that the time-based enumeration vulnerability is not very common, as “this kind of bug depends on time and on the way the server handles it”.SECURITY DEEP DIVES Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to knowThe security issues have been fixed in Evolution versions 1.4.12, 2.0.4, and in 3.0.The researchers submitted their findings to Evolution on December 21. The developer responded quickly and issued a fix on the same day.Synacktiv said that the vendor’s choice to go public with details of the flaw weeks after its discovery was to “give time to people to fix (and time for us to publish).”Evolution CEO Dmytro Lukianenko thanked the researchers for their findings and has urged all users to update their software.RELATED WordPress 5.6 lands with new auto-update UI, Site Health enhancements",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/blocked-accounts-abused-in-evolution-cms-sql-injection-attacks,"['SQL', 'Injection', 'Database', 'Security', 'PHP', 'WordPress', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Authentication', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Vulnerabilities']"
no,Australian research institute confirms ‘likely’ data breach after third-party Accellion hack,Clinical trial files accessed after ‘secure sharing service’ suffers cyber intrusion,"The QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, Australia, is investigating a “likely” data breach after a third-party service was compromised.The medical research institution said its early investigation indicates that certain data stored in file-sharing system Accellion has been accessed.Accellion, a US-based company that offers a secure file sharing system, announced it had been the victim of a cyber-attack on December 25 last year.Read more of the latest data breach newsQIMR Berghofer said it was informed by Accellion on January 4, 2021, to apply a security patch, which it says it did so “immediately”, after also taking the software offline.On February 2, the medical organization said it was told that it had been affected by the data breach. The institute’s investigation revealed that around 4% of its data held by Accellion had been accessed.Nine employees of QIMR Berghofer used Accellion’s service, a press release states.Stolen filesQIMR Berghofer said that it used Accellion’s services to share data related to clinical trials of anti-malaria drugs. However, it confirmed that no personally identifiable information was stored in the files.Instead, the organization said that codes are used to refer to study participants.A statement from QIMR Berghofer reads: “Some of the documents in Accellion include de-identified information such as the initials, date of birth, age, gender, and ethnic group of clinical trial participants, as well as the participant codes.“Some other documents include participants’ de-identified medical histories, along with their codes.”In addition to the clinical trial data, the resumés of an estimated 30 current and former research staff were also stored in Accellion and could potentially have been accessed.QIMR Berghofer also uses the software to share some internal files, and to share documents with the Mosquito and Arbovirus Research Committee, it said.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Tokyo Gas discloses data breach impacting anime-style dating simulation game“We are very concerned that some data appears to have been accessed and I want to say a sincere sorry to our stakeholders, particularly our clinical trial partners and members of the public who took part in our anti-malarial drug trials,” QIMR Berghofer’s director and CEO, Professor Fabienne Mackay, said.Professor Mackay added: “We don’t believe that any of the information in Accellion could be used to identify any of these participants, but nonetheless, I want to apologise sincerely that some of their de-identified information could potentially have been accessed.“Many of these files have to be kept for 15 years. However, they did not need to be stored in Accellion. We are examining our protocols for using third-party file-sharing services and will put procedures in place to try to ensure that files are regularly reviewed and saved in the most secure location.”Zero-day vulnerabilityThe breach at Accellion impacted a number of organizations worldwide after a 20-year-old product that was nearing end of life – Accellion FTA – was targeted.Accellion said that attackers took advantage of a zero-day product in the legacy software during the “sophisticated” hack.All known issues have since been patched, said the company, adding that it has employed “new monitoring and alerting capabilities to flag anomalies associated with these attack vectors”.Last month, New Zealand’s Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te P?tea Matua – announced it had also been the victim of a data breach following the incident.The central bank said that the personal and sensitive information of clients had potentially been accessed after the unknown hackers gained access to files stored in Accellion.Bank Governor Adrian Orr described the breach as “significant” and apologized “unreservedly” for the incident.READ MORE Data breach at New Zealand’s Reserve Bank after third-party service hack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/australian-research-institute-confirms-likely-data-breach-after-third-party-accellion-hack,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Healthcare', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Australia', 'Oceania', 'US', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Zero-day', 'Organizations', 'Encryption', 'Cybercrime', 'Network', 'Security']"
no,Software supply chain attacks – everything you need to know,"The SolarWinds breach brought a dangerous attack vector to the fore, but supply chain attacks are far from a new phenomenon","In December 2020, with much of the world distracted by a Covid-19 resurgence and the aftermath of the US presidential election, security researchers were busy tracking a new malware campaign – UNC2452 – which had grave implications for cybersecurity in the western world.Subsequently linked with Russian state-sponsored cybercrime gang APT29 (or Cozy Bear) the attack ‘trojanized’ software updates to Orion, an IT monitoring and management application from SolarWinds.Researchers from FireEye, the campaign’s first high-profile victim, discovered that hackers had turned part of Orion into a back door that communicated with third-party servers. FireEye named the Trojanized plug-in – a standard Windows installer patch file – ‘SUNBURST’.READ MORE Upstream attacks on open source ecosystem up 400% as criminals compromise apps at scaleWithin days, dozens of global businesses and government departments were reporting Sunburst infections, including Microsoft and the US Department of Homeland Security.Sunburst delivered multiple payloads, with some launching Cobalt Strike Beacon via the Teardrop loader. According to FireEye, “post compromise activity following this supply chain compromise has included lateral movement and data theft”.More worrying still, the Sunburst trojan first started to infect networks potentially as far back as March 2020.The world had just witnessed its largest ever software supply chain attack.What is a software supply chain attack?A software supply chain attack happens when hackers manipulate the code in third-party software components in order to compromise the ‘downstream’ applications that use them.Attackers leverage compromised software to steal data, corrupt targeted systems, or to gain access to other parts of the victim’s network through lateral movement.The 2013 attack against US retail giant Target is perhaps the best-known example of lateral movement. Hackers compromised systems at Target’s heating and ventilation supplier, then used the application’s trusted status to gain access to the retailer’s sensitive data.Read more of the latest hacking techniquesAny other ‘upstream’ part of an organization’s supply chain can be thus targeted, including application developers, publishers of off-the-shelf software like SolarWinds, API providers, and the open source community.“In a software supply chain attack, a malicious actor targets an organization or individual by compromising the most insecure element of their software supply chain,” Paolo Passeri, cyber intelligence principal at Netskope, told The Daily Swig.“The attackers tamper with the development process of the software to inject a malicious component, such as a remote access tool, that will let them establish a foothold into the targeted organisation or individual.”SolarWinds revealed it was hit by a high-profile supply chain attack in December 2020Recent supply chain attacksDependency confusion, 2021 – A security researcher breached systems belonging to the likes of Microsoft, Apple, Uber, and Tesla using a novel attack technique. Leveraging dependency/namespace confusion, Alex Birsan successfully sent counterfeit (but benign) packages downstream to dozens of high-profile targets with no social engineering required.Mimecast, 2021 – Cloud security firm Mimecast reported that attackers had compromised a certificate used by the vendor to authenticate its services on Microsoft 365 Exchange Web Services. Around 10% of Mimecast customers use applications that rely on the compromised certificate, but Mimecast said that only a handful were affected.SolarWinds, 2020 – The most far-reaching supply chain attack yet stemmed from a backdoor, SUNBURST, which was injected into the Orion IT management application’s update tool. In filings to the SEC, SolarWinds said 18,000 customers had downloaded the backdoor. Microsoft, in turn, notified 40 customers of the attack.ASUS, 2018 – An attack dubbed ShadowHammer targeted owners of ASUS computers in 2018. Researchers at Symantec believe the attack, which saw malware delivered via ASUS’ automatic update feature, ran from June to October and affected up to 500,000 systems. Other vendors might also have been affected.event-stream, 2018 – A 2018 attack on a GitHub repository in which malware was injected into the disused flatmap-stream dependency, which was part of event-stream. The number of applications that pulled the compromised dependency into their code remains unknown.What makes supply chain attacks so dangerous?It’s a daunting problem to tackle.“From the evidence we’ve seen from the recent SolarWinds attack, IT security teams have a limited grasp of the risks posed by software supply chains,” Kevin Bocek, VP security strategy and threat intelligence, Venafi, told The Daily Swig.Modern software is invariably built from readymade components: proprietary code, open source components, and third-party APIs. No one developer can build a modern application on their own, and software reuse is the norm.Writing before the SolarWinds attack, GitHub security researcher Maya Kaczorowski cited data suggesting that 85-97% of enterprise software codebases come from open source components. The average project now has 203 dependences, according to GitHub’s State of the Octoverse survey.Catch up on the latest open source software security newsBut while code reuse simplifies and accelerates application development, it creates some very serious security problems – not least the fact that compromised off-the-shelf components can leave countless organizations vulnerable to attack.Vendors of software components “serve multiple customers, so if their systems are compromised, it’s a much wider issue”, Scott Nicholson, director at security advisors Bridewell Consulting, told The Daily Swig.“Many organisations are complacent about supply chain risks – our recent research showed less than one fifth (18%) of critical national infrastructure organisations viewed third-party suppliers and partners as the biggest risk to their organization.”Although supply chain attacks have been around for some time – some researchers claim since the 1980s – many CISOs are only now becoming aware of the gravity of the threat, especially to enterprise applications.“We are becoming much more aware of it,” Professor Yehuda Lindell, security researcher and co-founder of Unbound Tech, told The Daily Swig.“We have seen quite a few [incidents] in the not-too-distant past: SolarWinds, Mimecast, ASUS, where attackers managed to sign a legitimate key on malicious version of firmware infecting millions of computers.” It is, he warns, a “very effective attack vector”, not least because hackers can compromise a wide range of organisations in one hit.Software supply chain attacks are a persistent threat to organizations of all sizesSoftware versus hardware supply chain attacksWhether it’s routers, servers, IoT devices, or mobile phones, hardware manufacturers also outsource the provision of certain components to a myriad of organizations and, like, software developers, often have limited visibility of the security risks this incurs.According to Microsoft, hardware and its firmware is harder to tamper with than software, since it requires either interception while devices or their parts are en route to the factory, or factory floor manipulation. But the consequences can be serious.Once achieved, malicious changes are “extremely difficult to detect and fix, giving the perpetrator long-term access”, says Microsoft, not least because “because they bypass traditional software-based security detection tools”.Can you prevent or mitigate supply chain attacks?At the technical level, increasing security awareness among DevOps teams is the first and – many experts argue – most critical step.Teams need to incorporate security into the entire development process, have a comprehensive map of the dependences used by their applications, be alert to vulnerability disclosures, and have a robust system for patching security bugs.Project leaders could also look at software bills of materials (SBOMs) to track components, and audit their own controls to keep software secure.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/software-supply-chain-attacks-everything-you-need-to-know,"['Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Windows', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Research', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Secure', 'Development', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Mobile', 'Malware', 'IoT', 'Hardware', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Coronavirus', 'GitHub', 'Microsoft', 'Analysis', 'Apple', 'Deep', 'Dives']"

no,"Researcher hacks Apple, Microsoft, and other major tech companies in novel supply chain attack",Bug hunter rewarded with $130k payout for ‘dependency confusion’ vulnerability,"A security researcher has detailed how he was able to hack into systems belonging to Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, and other major tech companies in a novel software supply chain attack.Bug hunter Alex Birsan detailed in a blog post published yesterday (February 9) how he gained access to his targets’ internal systems by exploiting a vulnerability dubbed ‘dependency confusion’.Dependency confusion is the name given to a vulnerability that can allow an attacker to execute malware within a company’s networks by overriding privately-used dependency packages with malicious, public packages of the same name.Many companies use both private and public dependencies in their source code. Public dependencies can be uploaded to open source depositor GitHub by anyone, meaning that they could potentially contain malicious code.What’s in a name?Birsan said he came up with the idea for dependency confusion when studying a Node.js file meant for internal PayPal use, which was shared by his researcher friend Justin Gardner.The code contained both private and public dependencies, said Birsan. Under further inspection, he realised that some of the private package names did not exist on the public NPM registry.“What happens if malicious code is uploaded to NPM under these names?” Birsan wrote. “Is it possible that some of PayPal’s internal projects will start defaulting to the new public packages instead of the private ones?”Read more of the latest secure software development newsBirsan tested his theory, uploading malicious code to public NPM dependency registries under the names of private packages he found on GitHub, package hosting sites, and online forums. None of these private packages were already listed as public.The researcher found that if a dependency package was listed under the same name on both public and private repositories, the public version would be given priority and would be used instead.Worryingly, the attack did not need any interaction from the developer to be successful, automatically replacing private packages with Birsan’s malicious public one.“Thankfully, NPM allows arbitrary code to be executed automatically upon package installation, allowing me to easily create a Node package that collects some basic information about each machine it is installed on through its preinstall script,” Birsan said.He then sent the information back to himself using DNS exfiltration in order to evade detection by developers.Other targetsThe researcher later carried out the same technique by creating public RubyGems and Python packages, porting his malicious code into the dependencies and recreating the attack.Birsan was able to exploit this vulnerability to breach the internal systems of the above mentioned organisations as well as Shopify, Netflix, Yelp, Tesla, and Uber – earning at least a $130,000 bug bounty in the process.The vulnerability was detected inside more than 35 organizations across all three tested programming languages, he wrote, adding that the “vast majority of the affected companies fall into the 1000+ employees category, which most likely reflects the higher prevalence of internal library usage within larger organizations”.Birsan wrote: From one-off mistakes made by developers on their own machines, to misconfigured internal or cloud-based build servers, to systemically vulnerable development pipelines, one thing was clear: squatting valid internal package names was a nearly sure-fire method to get into the networks of some of the biggest tech companies out there, gaining remote code execution, and possibly allowing attackers to add backdoors during builds.Protecting against the attackThe issue has since been confirmed to have been fixed by Apple, Yelp, and Microsoft, the latter of which has released an in-depth advisory (PDF) on how to mitigate risk when using private packages.Microsoft, which awarded its highest bug bounty payout of $40,000 for the vulnerability, told users to ensure all private packages are unavailable on public feeds, or make sure they are accessed through a single feed that safely merges public and private views. More information on how to safely use private dependency packages can be found in the advisory (PDF).YOU MAY ALSO LIKE WordPress security flaws: 800,000 sites running NextGen Gallery plugin potentially vulnerable to pwnage",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researcher-hacks-apple-microsoft-and-other-major-tech-companies-in-novel-supply-chain-attack,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Node.js', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'DNS', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Organizations', 'Research']"
no,Call for comments: European Data Protection Board lays out data breach notification guidelines for organizations,Regulator asks for industry feedback as it develops breach notification examples for a range of cyber-attacks,"It’s the stuff of nightmares: your organization has fallen victim to a cyber-attack, and you need to work out how to handle your response.The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets out basic requirements for notification but leaves room for maneuver, with data controllers required to assess risks and make decisions themselves on whether notification is required, and if so to whom.However, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has acknowledged that GDPR doesn’t go into enough detail – and the regulatory body has now published a set of data breach notification examples and called for comment from the industry.Making an exampleThe 18 examples in the Guidelines on Examples Regarding Data Breach Notification (PDF) include everything from ransomware attacks to mis-sent emails, with detailed suggestions of how the breach could have been prevented or mitigated, and on how it should be dealt with.In one case study, for instance, a computer used by an agricultural company is exposed to a ransomware attack, and its data encrypted by the attacker. No electronic backup is available, only paper records.RECOMMENDED Ransom-related DDoS attacks rise from the dead as attack vectors diversifyThe document lists the measures that should have been taken to avoid the problem – primarily, backups and encryption – and recommends that in this particular case, both the authorities and the data subjects should be notified.Other scenarios include data exfiltration, internal human-related risks, lost or stolen devices and documents, post-related breaches and social engineering.For each of these, there’s a discussion of the measures – if any – put in place by the data controller to protect personal data and prevent a breach; the circumstances surrounding the breach, the resulting risk, the mitigating steps that should be taken by the controller, and the controller’s ensuing obligations.Room for improvementThe guidelines are being broadly welcomed by the information security industry.“The data breach notification examples are helpful in that they clearly set out non-binding guidance to organisations in handling some of the most common scenarios,” says Adam Palmer, chief cybersecurity strategist at Tenable.However, some observers say they don’t go far enough, highlighting the lack of detail on handling cloud service breaches.“I would have liked to see the guidelines including 20 examples, so that cloud and third-party supplier breaches were explored in much greater detail,” Neil Thacker, data protection officer and CISO for Netskope, told The Daily Swig.“All that we have in there at the moment is the recommendation of ‘disabling open cloud services’, which shows a lack of understanding of exactly how cloud services are being used in businesses.”Read more of the latest data breach newsBharat Mistry, UK technical director of Trend Micro, agrees.“The shortfall I see in the report is that it doesn’t reference public cloud-based attacks, and in particular where an organisation is leveraging a mix of cloud native services like cloud file storage, serverless computing and containerised runtime for microservices,” he says.“I would have expected to see references and examples to the shared responsibility model, so that controllers know where their responsibility lies.”And, adds Dave Barnett, director of edge protection for EMEA at Forcepoint, “The practical examples cited in these new guidelines will be appreciated by users, but they could go further by offering legally watertight examples of communications that could be issued to the subjects involved should an incident happen.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/call-for-comments-european-data-protection-board-lays-out-data-breach-notification-guidelines-for-organizations,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Europe', 'Industry', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Privacy', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Ransomware', 'Malware', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Analysis', 'Phishing', 'Coronavirus', 'Compliance', 'GDPR', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hardware', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Legal', 'UK', 'Enterprise', 'Authentication', 'Encryption', 'Passwords']"

This means that users would be well advised to tread carefully, Zscaler advised.“As the use of free cloud file-sharing platforms are increasingly adopted by cybercriminals, Discord has no ‘report abuse’ button corresponding to shared file but does have a web link to report abuse which is not so user friendly like other cloud services,” Desai said.“So, users must not download the file from unknown or untrustworthy sources, as this app allows any Discord user to join any chat group and share files.”RECOMMENDED Container security: Privilege escalation bug patched in Docker Engine",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/malware-slingers-step-up-efforts-to-target-gamers-on-discord,"['Gaming', 'Malware', 'Ransomware', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cybercrime', 'Social', 'Media', 'Privacy', 'Email', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security']"
no,"WordPress security flaws: 800,000 sites running NextGen Gallery plugin potentially vulnerable to pwnage",Unpatched sites could get pwned – but admins must fall for social engineering,"UPDATED Users of NextGEN Gallery, the image management plugin for WordPress, have been urged to update their websites after the discovery of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.The most serious of two flaws found by security researchers – each residing in separate security functions – could lead to remote code execution (RCE) and stored cross-site scripting (XSS).As a result, attackers could take control of a website, inject it with spam links, or redirect visitors to phishing domains, according to a blog post disclosing the findings of Wordfence researchers yesterday (February 8).Critical – with caveatsAlthough one flaw (CVE-2020-35942) was assigned a critical CVSS of 9.6, and the other, file upload bug (CVE-2020-35943) was deemed borderline critical (CVSS 8.8), both first required the duping of an administrator into clicking a malicious link.Exploitation of the critical vulnerability was dependent on the user triggering the sending of two malicious crafted requests instead of one, and the existence of at least one image album created by web admins.However, Wordfence threat analyst Ram Gall, who discovered the flaws, told The Daily Swig that they managed to send “both requests required to achieve RCE with a single visit”, while “most sites using Nextgen gallery are going to have a published album because that’s the primary use case for the plugin.“In other words, this is as easy or hard to exploit as any other CSRF. The social engineering aspect is the only restriction, and the CVSS score takes into account that user interaction is required.”However, Mike Weichert, chief architect at Imagely, added further caveats. The vulnerable function is maintained “for backwards compatibility”, in a rarely used feature, he told The Daily Swig. “As such, we were achieving security-via-obscurity in this regard till now. We should make it clear too – these vulnerabilities require admin access” and successful social engineering.”Published by Imagely, NextGen Gallery is an open source extension with more than 800,000 installations.CSRF via file upload or LFIThe critical flaw resides in the settings-safeguarding security function is_authorized_request.A logic flaw in a function that consolidates capability and nonce checks meant the nonce check permitted requests where the “$_REQUEST[‘nonce’] parameter was missing, rather than invalid”, explained Gall in the blog post.As a result, it was possible to upload CSS files with double extensions (for example file.php.css) and achieve RCE.“These files would only be executable on certain configurations, such as Apache/mod_php with an AddHandler directive,” said Gall.Catch up on the latest WordPress security newsHowever, RCE, along with local file inclusion (LFI), could be achieved with other configurations via the soon-to-be-deprecated ‘legacy templates’ feature, which also uses is_authorized_request.“Thus, it was possible to set various album types to use a template with the absolute path of the file uploaded in the previous step, or perform a directory traversal attack using the relative path of the uploaded file, regardless of that file’s extension, through a CSRF attack,” explained Gall.The uploaded file would then be “executed whenever the selected album type was viewed on the site”, and, if armed with JavaScript, result in XSS. However, site takeover would only follow “if a logged-in administrator visits a page running a malicious injected script”.Gall also told The Daily Swig: “It’s possible to set every legacy template to use the relative path to the uploaded file in a single request, so no reconnaissance is necessary to determine what types of album are published or to gain knowledge of the site’s file structure in order to include the uploaded file.”CSRF leading to file uploadThe validate_ajax_request security function shared the same $_REQUEST[‘nonce’] flaw as is_authorized_request, which enabled attackers to trick “an administrator into submitting a request crafted to upload an arbitrary image file” containing a hidden webshell or other executable PHP code.The two flaws could also be chained to set the image file as a ‘legacy template’, thus unleashing the malicious code – but again, only once an administrator clicks a malicious link.‘Fast and professional’Imagely received the vulnerability report on December 15, and released the patched version, 3.5.0, two days later on December 17. All previous versions are affected.Wordfence’s Gall praised Imagely’s “fast and professional response” and urged site owners to “immediately update to the latest version”.Said Mike Weichert of Imagely: “We take all security reports very seriously. When a report comes in, it’s all hands on deck to patch the hole and push a release as soon as possible,” although he added that many are “for issues we’ve found and addressed already”.Plans to deprecate “rarely used functionality” were now being accelerated, he continued, while ageing components of the plugin – one of the WordPress ecosystem’s oldest – would be replaced “this year with modern and secure counterparts.”Weichert said Gall “was a pleasure to work with” and expressed gratitude for “a free security audit from the best in the business”.This article was updated on February 10 with additional comments from Wordfence, then on February 11 with comments from Imagely.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/wordpress-security-flaws-800-000-sites-running-nextgen-gallery-plugin-potentially-vulnerable-to-pwnage,"['WordPress', 'Vulnerabilities', 'CSRF', 'Research', 'PHP', 'XSS', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Industry', 'News', 'RCE', 'Path', 'Traversal', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'JavaScript', 'Organizations']"

no,Ransom-related DDoS attacks rise from the dead as attack vectors diversify,DDoS extortion is back…,"ANALYSIS A growth in ransom-related DDoS (RDDoS) attacks has accompanied a growing sophistication and diversity in attack vectors over the last year, according to a range of security vendors quizzed by The Daily Swig.Types of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can include volumetric, protocol-based, and application-based assaults. Many are slung from so-called botnets of compromised computers, mobiles, or IoT devices.Means, motive, and opportunityThe most common motives for launching a DDoS and jamming an adversary/competitor’s web performance include extorting victims for financial gain or to serve as a decoy tactic for another cyber-attack.Bindu Sundaresan, director at AT&T Cybersecurity, told The Daily Swig: “Motives today can include an interest in obtaining a financial reward, making an ideological statement, creating a geopolitical advantage, or exacting revenge for particular government action, corporate campaign, or policy stance.”Pay up or say goodbye to your network resourcesDavid Elmaleh, senior product manager of edge services at cloud and network appliance security vendor Imperva, told The Daily Swig that RDDoS campaigns motivated by financial gain saw a considerable increase in 2020.“We saw RDDoS threats targeting thousands of large commercial organizations globally, not least the financial services industry,” Elmaleh explained.“Of the RDDoS we’ve monitored, the extortionists leverage the names of well-known threat actor groups in their ransom messages to demand payment in bitcoin currency to prevent a DDoS attack on their target’s network.”Read more of the latest DDoS attack newsFor example, Imperva reports that one group using the name ‘Lazarus’ threatened to launch a DDoS attack against an entire network if a ransom was not paid within six days.“Once the attack has started, a payment of 30 bitcoin (approximately $328,000) will stop it, with an additional 10 bitcoin ($110,000) demanded for each day the ransom remains unpaid,” according to Imperva’s Elmaleh.“The extortionist also threatened to begin a small DDoS attack on the company’s main IP address immediately to prove the threat is not a hoax.”DDoS as a smokescreenDDoS attacks can sometimes be deployed as a distraction from even more nefarious activities.Chris Bates, chief information security officer at SentinelOne, warned: “DDoS attacks are a perfect smokescreen: they can be used by sophisticated attackers to divert the attention of security teams while the intruders infiltrate the organization in another way.”For example, in August 2020, a DDoS extortion gang masquerading as the Armada Collective and APT28 (Fancy Bear), conducted an attack that impacted the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) for a number of consecutive days.“This resulted in a shutdown of operations and halting of trading, with the activity also targeting several other financial institutions,” Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows, told The Daily Swig.“Whereas most DDoS extortionists often target their victims’ public websites, this activity saw the repeated targeting of backend infrastructure, API endpoints, DNS servers, and even the NZX internet service providers.”“This shift towards backend systems may explain the prolonged outages associated with these attacks,” he added.Ransomware + DDoS deployed in combination attacksConversely, less sophisticated ransomware operators have also been observed using DDoS attacks as an additional method for extortion.One trend that emerged during 2020 involved ransomware operators leveraging DDoS to force targets back to the negotiation table.“If encryption did not impress the target and the threat of leaking data did not convince the target to pay up, ransomware operators started DDoS attacks to further intimidate their targets and tempt them to succumb to the demand,” Pascal Geenens, threat intelligence director at DDoS mitigation vendor Radware, told The Daily Swig.For example, Avaddon ransomware operators reportedly used DDoS to disrupt a targeted company’s network if the company refused to enter ransom negotiations.This also has a secondary effect of disrupting any remediation activities, like processing backups of impacted data, according to Digital Shadows.Catch up on the latest ransomware attack newsDon Smith, senior director of IT Security at SecureWorks, added that “If the threat of data encryption and exfiltration are not enough to persuade a victim to pay the ransom, then perhaps loss of internet-facing servers and devices through DDoS attacks might be”.Other ransomware operators, including SunCrypt and RagnarLocker, have also been observed mounting DDoS attacks.According to Smith, the last year has seen a diversification in the post-intrusion ransomware landscape, with some players now running ransomware-as-a-service affiliate models.“Ransomware operations conducted by affiliates is reflected in diversifying threat actor playbooks, behaviours; it is reflected in ransom demands, indeed in the professionalism of the criminals,” he told The Daily Swig.Candid Wüest, vice president of cyber protection research at cyber security and data protection vendor Acronis, added that “DDoS services are easily available to rent through botnets on underground sites, making it a simple expansion for the ransomware group.”Natalie Page, cyber threat intelligence analyst at SY4 Security, also pointed out that groups primarily known for cryptomining operations such as TeamTNT and Lucifer are stocking up with DDoS attack tools.TTPsF5 reports that most reported DDoS attacks were volumetric, saturating network bandwidth with junk packets to clog up the connections for legitimate users.Common, low-effort ransom DDoS attacks use amplification vectors such as DNS response, SSDP, NTP or Memcache. DNS amplification attacks, for example, involve spoofing DNS requests in order to flood a victim with junk traffic.“The first half of 2020 also saw a rise in DDoS attacks targeting websites and applications. In 2019, 4.2% of the DDoS attacks reported to the F5 SIRT were identified as targeting web apps. However, this increased sixfold in 2020 to 26%,” according to Raymond Pompon, director at F5 Labs.Neustar notes that back in July the FBI warned that common network protocols like ARMS (Apple Remote Management Services), WS-DD (Web Services Dynamic Discovery), and CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) were being abused by hackers to conduct DDoS reflection and amplification attacks – while cautioning that disabling them could cause a loss in business productivity and connectivity.Radware’s Geenens added: “While there has been a number of new protocols that were weaponised in DoS attack vectors such as RDP, ARMS, WS-DD, CoAP, the fundamental technique is still very much spoofing and amplification.”While WS-DD and CoAP are vulnerable in unsecured IoT deployments and connected devices, RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) became a popular attack vector as organizations hastily deployed remote access solutions to support teleworking during the pandemic, according to Geenens.NXNSAttackSome new techniques, like the NXNSAttack discovered by researchers at Tel Aviv University, take advantage of vulnerabilities in common DNS software.The NXNSAttack technique can cause a DNS server to perform hundreds of thousands of requests every time a hacker’s machine sends just one, effectively amplifying the attacker’s firepower. This means an attacker has to compromise a relatively small number of machines to achieve massive impact – something that previously required the creation of a huge botnet.Short but not sweetThe trend is also towards shorter attack duration but greater packet-per-second attack volume.Alan Calder, founder and executive chairman of IT Governance, a cyber risk and privacy management firm, told The Daily Swig that the “volume of DDoS attacks, and the technical expertise that supports them, has grown significantly over the last 12 months”.“Attackers [are] executing high-speed, short-duration, multi-vector attacks that can be extremely challenging to defend against,” he warned.RELATED DDoS attacks more numerous, diverse, but smaller in Q3 of 2020Alexander Gutnikov, system analyst at Kaspersky’s DDoS prevention service, told The Daily Swig: “In 2020, the average duration decreased by about a third, compared to 2019; while the maximum length increased. At the same time, the share of so-called ‘smart’ attacks – ones that require sophisticated skills and usually target application level – almost didn’t change (39% in 2019, 37% in 2020), as well as their maximum length.“This suggests that short attacks are getting shorter and long ones are becoming longer; and we observed a similar trend in the Q4 2020 as well,” he added.5G futureDDoS attacks are getting more powerful because they’re getting more complex, using many different devices, and targeting other parts of the victim’s network, according to AT&T Cybersecurity’s Sundaresan.The biggest DDoS attacks by volume to date are thought to have been the 2.5 terabytes per second (Tbps) assault against Google in 2017 and 2.3 Tbps attack that targeted Amazon in 2018. The advent of 5G may usher in even more vicious assaults.Bryan Murphy, director of consulting services at security vendor CyberArk, warned: “By increasing the overall bandwidth available, 5G allows an incredible number of IoT devices to be connected. These devices are often easy to compromise and control as part of amassing a botnet army, however, because there is still no standard for IoT security.”READ MORE Artificial intelligence can stop IoT-based DDoS attacks in their tracks – research",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ransom-related-ddos-attacks-rise-from-the-dead-as-attack-vectors-diversify,"['DDoS', 'Denial', 'of', 'Service', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Ransomware', 'DNS', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News', 'Malware', 'Enterprise', 'Encryption', 'Organizations', 'Analysis', 'IoT']"

If “too many” tags are added to the content value, this will render a chat session unresponsive and “fully inaccessible” for both an attacker and victim.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/skype-spoofing-vulnerabilities-are-a-haven-for-social-engineering-attacks-security-researcher-claims,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Microsoft', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Research', 'Organizations', 'Social', 'Media', 'Email', 'Security']"
no,Hack against older Nespresso vending machines facilitates endless free beverage exploit,MOAR coffee!,"A security researcher figured out a way to hack older Nespresso coffee machine smart cards in order to obtain virtually unlimited free drinks.The hack, developed by Belgian security researcher Polle Vanhoof, offers a mechanism to meddle with commercial Nespresso coffee machines by dumping and modifying their custom stored-value cards.The process of cracking the keys and dumping the contents of these prepaid cards is possible because of the inherent security shortcomings of the Mifare Classic smart card technology that comes paired with some Nespresso coffee machines.Shot in the darkThese security shortcomings (PDF) have been understood since at least 2008, even though they’ve never previously been applied in this particular way.Mifare Classic smart cards have long been replaced by more secure Mifare Plus cards.Because of the inherent security weakness of Mifare Classic, however, it is possible to read and write arbitrary data to these cards after cracking any non-default keys.RECOMMENDED CacheFlow: Malware hidden in popular browser extensions went undetected for yearsThis problem is compounded in the particular case of Nespresso because the coffee-maker uses these cards to store the loaded monetary value directly.As a result, a hacker can overwrite the stored value and set the loaded currency to an arbitrary figure, as explained in Vanhoof’s technical write-up.Remote caffeine executionA more robust system would have the cards store only a unique identifier and have the Nespresso machines check what monetary value is associated with that value through a backend server.This approach would only work if every Nespresso machine that accepted smart cards had a network connection.Read more of the latest security research from around the worldIt would also require the coffee machine vendor to provision a backend server to handle these lookups.Nespresso told Vanhoof that it already offered this facility, as well as the option for customers to upgrade to more secure hardware tokens.Vanhoof reported his findings to Nespresso back in September before a lengthy disclosure process that finally permitted him to go public with his findings earlier this week.The Daily Swig asked Nespresso to comment on Vanhoof’s research.

no,CacheFlow: Malware hidden in popular browser extensions went undetected for years,Affected web plugins had more than three million downloads combined,"Data-stealing malware that hid undetected for years shows that even popular web browser extensions can be vulnerable to exploitation, security researchers from Avast Threat Labs have warned.A blog post from Avast Threat Labs researchers contains technical details on how the malware, titled ‘CacheFlow’, went undetected for at least three years.The malware in question, which was hidden in popular third-party web extensions, contained backdoors that downloaded and executed arbitrary JavaScript.It attempted to steal personal information such as birth dates, email addresses, geolocations, and device activity taken from a victim’s Google account, before sending it back to the attacker’s control server.CacheFlow also replaced links from Google, Bing, and other search engine queries with hijacked links serving phishing sites and advertisements.YOU MAY LIKE Browser security briefing: Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a ‘post-XSS world’“Anytime a user clicked on a link, the extensions sent information about the click to the attacker’s control server,” researcher Jan Vojtesek told The Daily Swig.“This can optionally send a command to redirect the victim from the real link target to a new hijacked URL before redirecting them to the actual website they wanted to visit.”Hidden dangerThe malware was spread via dozens of malicious Chrome and Edge browser extensions that had an estimated combined three million downloads. A number of the plugins were available on the browsers’ official stores.Affected extensions included Video Downloader for Facebook, Vimeo Video Downloader, Instagram Story Downloader, and VK Unblock.The blog post published yesterday (February 3) details how the attackers were able to go unnoticed by a victim before the campaign was discovered in December 2020.Interestingly, the malware itself did not trigger until three days after the extension was downloaded to avoid immediate detection.It also avoided detection by assessing whether its victim would have the technical knowledge to spot it on their device.An image shows the various steps undertaken by the CacheFlow malware, courtesy of Avast Threat Labs“First of all, they avoided infecting users who were likely to be web developers,” Avast Threat Labs said.“They determined this either through the extensions the user had installed or by checking if the user accessed locally-hosted websites.”It adds: “When the malware detected that the browser developer tools were opened, it would immediately deactivate its malicious functionality.“CacheFlow also checked every Google search query and if the user was googling for one of the malware’s command and control (C&C) domains, it reported this to its C&C server and could deactivate itself as well.”CacheFlow was notable in particular for the way that the malicious extensions would try to hide their C&C traffic in a covert channel using the Cache-Control HTTP header of their analytics requests, noted researchers.Researchers believe that the malicious authors were also interested in the analytics requests themselves.Widespread problemAvast Threat Labs researchers came across the campaign after Czech researcher Edvard Rejthar from CZ.NIC published this blog post.On further inspection, the team found that “many other extensions were doing the same thing”.Google Play reviews cited issues with extensions such as adware as far back as October 2017, leading the team to believe that CacheFlow has been active since at least that time.Researchers said that the main risk to users is their personal information being exposed.“Moreover, the extensions can download and execute arbitrary JavaScript with access to the browser extension API, even putting the victim’s payment card data at risk,” researcher Jan Rubin told The Daily Swig.Read more of the latest news about malwareGoogle and Microsoft had both taken down all of the malicious plugins in their stores as of December 18, 2020.It is unlikely that the actors will use the same malware since it is now easily detectable, the researchers said, adding that this campaign “has shown that even popular browser extensions installed from official browser stores can contain malware.“To lower the risk of being infected by a malicious extension, we recommend that users review carefully the permissions requested by the extensions they intend to install,” Rubin added.“It is suspicious if an extension requests a permission that is not needed for its advertised functionality.“We also recommend reading user reviews – it might be the case that other users have already noticed that the extension is behaving suspiciously, and mentioned this in the reviews.”READ MORE Sharkcop: Google Chrome extension uses machine learning to detect phishing URLs",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cacheflow-malware-hidden-in-popular-browser-extensions-went-undetected-for-years,"['Browsers', 'Malware', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Edge', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Chrome', 'Privacy', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Social', 'Media', 'Europe', 'Research', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Vulnerabilities', 'JavaScript', 'Fraud', 'Phishing']"
no,"Zeoticus 2.0 ransomware raises stakes with C2-free execution, supercharged encryption","Infections now harder to control, contain, and mitigate","The release of a more versatile and effective version of the Zeoticus ransomware has underlined the growing importance of attack prevention, a security researcher has concluded.Unlike its predecessor, Zeoticus 2.0 can execute payloads without connectivity or remote commands, according to a malware analysis conducted by SentinelOne.The ransomware strain, which first surfaced in early 2020, “will execute fully offline, with no dependence on a C2 (Command & Control)”, writes Jim Walter, senior threat researcher at the cybersecurity vendor, in a blog post.Encryption expressMost Zeoticus 2.0 upgrades “are focused on speed and efficiency”, such as the employment of rapid encryption algorithms, which include the symmetric XChaCha20 algorithm and, on the asymmetric side, Poly1305, XSalsa20, and Curve25519.The latest version can also discover and terminate encryption-disrupting processes, says Walter.The pool and exploitable attack surface of potential targets has broadened too, with the malware now able to discover and infect remote drives compatible with all Windows OS lines and possibly even able to “run on Windows XP and earlier”.Issued since late 2020, malware platform updates have also recently included “updates on file extension-based identification and performance around the prioritization and encryption of extremely large files”, says the researcher.RE: Ransom noteEncrypted files are modified with extensions comprising the attacker’s contact email address and the string ‘2020END’.Zeoticus mounts a new volume containing a ransom note that instructs victims “to contact the attacker via email as opposed to using an onion-based payment portal or similar”.A copy of the ransom note is also dropped into the system drive root (such as C:\WINDOWS\README.html).RECOMMENDED British Mensa website hacked after directors quit over ‘data protection failures’By contrast, v1.0 altered the desktop wallpaper while presenting the ransom instructions instead of mounting a new volume.The malware is designed not to function in Russia, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan, says Walter, with its developers clearly mindful – like many of their CIS-based peers – of the potential “backlash from regional government and law enforcement agencies” in the region.Execution, persistence“Upon execution, pertinent files are identified based on extension”, while “the encryptable-extension list is fully customizable and in the control of the attacker”, notes the researcher.After launching, the malware replicates itself with copies appearing in C:\Windows and %AppData%.Zeoticus then destroys numerous running processes via taskkill.exe, and uses the ping command to redirect command output to >nul & del and facilitate deletion of its own binaries.A WMI query subsequently gathers additional information about the local environment.All Zeoticus samples, both v1.0 and v2.0, create a registry run key to achieve persistence, with the registry entry “set to launch an instance of the Zeoticus payload from C:\Windows”.‘Visibility and education’“Active ransomware infections are getting increasingly difficult to control, contain, and mitigate,” says Walter. This makes infection prevention “more important than ever given the difficulty of recovering from a catastrophic ransomware attack”.“Visibility and education go a long way” in improving security posture, he adds.Read more of the latest ransomware news“A thorough and accurate understanding of the environment is key in prioritizing controls and reducing risk.”End users should also be educated on attackers’ methods and encouraged to report suspicious activity, continues the researcher.“Finally, ensure that all technological controls are installed and implemented properly, and are up to date with the latest patches,” he concludes.The Daily Swig has contacted SentinelOne for further comment.

no,Third mutation XSS bug patched in Mozilla Bleach library,"Coordinated disclosure helps protect more than 100,000 dependencies","Bleach, a Python library that enables web developers to clean HTML input and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, was itself found to have an XSS vulnerability, according to an advisory posted on GitHub by Mozilla, the library’s developer.Mozilla Bleach escapes and removes characters that can otherwise lead to the execution of arbitrary code when rendered on a browser. As of this writing, more than 100,000 GitHub repositories depend on Bleach.The vulnerability, discovered by researchers at Checkmarx, was found in the library’s clean() function, which sanitizes HTML code.“We have no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild,” a spokesperson for Mozilla told The Daily Swig.Mutation XSSDevelopers can control the kind of tags that will be allowed in the HTML code ahead of the cleaning process.A flaw in the way the function handled some configurations of allowed tags made it vulnerable to “mutation XSS”, a special kind of XSS flaw caused by how different browsers interpret HTML code.“Exploiting this vulnerability requires a non-default config, which is why we rated the severity as moderate,” the Mozilla spokesperson said.RECOMMENDED Playing Fetch: New XS-Leak exploits browser redirects to break user privacy“Producing this vulnerability requires satisfying a set of pre-conditions... If those conditions are met, the vulnerability can be reproduced.”Mozilla has patched the vulnerability in the latest version of Bleach. In the advisory, the organization recommends setting up a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate further risks.A growing threatIt is worth noting that this is the third mutation XSS bug found in Bleach in the past year.“Mutation XSS bugs have grown in popularity due to the recent release of detailed research blog posts and useful tools on the subject,” the Mozilla spokesperson said.“We consider a growing focus on specific vulnerabilities to be normal, once such related research is publicized.”Read more of the latest hacking newsIn written comments to The Daily Swig, Erez Yalon, head of security research at Checkmarx, warned that mutation XSS is relevant for every web application, not just those that are Python-based.“[Mutation XSS] is slightly more complex to find and exploit than other XSS attacks because it combines a weakness in the code with a browsers’ tendency to try and fix errors by content manipulations,” Yalon said.He added: “Having the code visible (as it is in open source) makes it a bit easier to execute, as the combination of the attacker’s payload through the code and the browser manipulation causes the harmful effect.”Mutation XSS is becoming more common among researchers and attackers, Yalon noted. “So, we believe it is our responsibility as security researchers to educate developers and try to find these issues in the wild before they are exploited,” he said.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/third-mutation-xss-bug-patched-in-mozilla-bleach-library,"['Vulnerabilities', 'XSS', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Network', 'Security', 'Privacy', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Mozilla', 'Browsers', 'Python']"
no,Multiple new flaws uncovered in SolarWinds software just weeks after high-profile supply chain attack,"Attention ‘provides the sunlight necessary to expose major flaws’, says Trustwave","Security researchers at Trustwave have discovered three new severe security vulnerabilities in the SolarWinds IT monitoring and management platform.The findings – detailed in a technical blog post published today (February 3) – come just weeks after the discovery that other flaws in the platform were exploited in a high-profile supply chain attack.RELATED Microsoft downplays threat after admitting SolarWinds attackers accessed source codeThe latest security issues discovered by Trustwave include two in the SolarWinds Orion Platform and one in SolarWinds Serv-U FTP for Windows. All three were resolved prior to public disclosure.The three vulnerabilities were all flagged as ‘severe’ according to Trustwave, with the most critical bug allowing remote code execution with high privileges.A separate vulnerability could allow any local user, despite privileges, to take complete control over the SOLARWINDS_ORION database.An adversary could steal information or add a new admin-level user to be used inside SolarWinds Orion products.‘Full server takeover’In response to questions from The Daily Swig, Trustwave explained the seriousness and potential impact of the flaws:These are all severe issues that could result in full server takeover. However, the most critical of the three vulnerabilities affects the Orion implementation of Microsoft Message Queue (CVE-2021-25274).This would allow any remote, unauthorized user with access to a vulnerable system the ability to run arbitrary code as LocalSystem.Because the Orion platform is often used for critical network operations to monitor and manage assets, attacks compromising these types of systems often provide the attacker with even more access to critical resources than a typical exploit [would].Users of affected products should apply patches as soon as possible, Trustwave advises.Read more of the latest network security newsAsked to comment on whether or not SolarWinds users should be concerned that other serious flaws were discovered within weeks of a high-profile attack, Trustwave was able to offer a somewhat reassuring response.Karl Sigler, senior security research manager at Trustwave’s SpiderLabs research division, said: “High profile compromises often draw many eyes including those of professional researchers.“Our hope is that the attention (especially among the ‘good guys’) provides the sunlight necessary to expose major flaws and provide the necessary gap closure to secure the technology.”The Daily Swig asked Texas-based SolarWinds to comment on the vulnerabilities. It responded with a statement stating that everything was in hand:Vulnerabilities of varying degrees are common in all software products, but we understand that there is heightened scrutiny on SolarWinds right now. The vulnerabilities announced by Trustwave concerning Orion 2020.2.4 have been addressed via a fix released on Jan 25, 2021. The vulnerabilities concerning Serv-U 115.2.2 have been addressed via fixes released on Jan 21 and 22, 2021.Following the recent nation-state attack against an array of American software providers, including SolarWinds, we have been collaborating with our industry partners and government agencies to advance our goal of making SolarWinds the most secure and trusted software company.We have always been committed to working with our customers and other organizations to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities across our product portfolio in a responsible way. Today’s announcement aligns with this process.Solar stormAPT29 – (AKA ‘Cozy Bear’), a group linked to Russian intelligence agencies – is suspected of compromising the update mechanism of Orion, SolarWinds’ enterprise network management software, and using this as a means to plant malware on the systems of its customers.The supply chain attacks affected numerous US government organizations as well as technology firms including Microsoft and FireEye before it was discovered last December.The ultimate goal of the attacks, which forensic work dates as beginning as early as March 2020, was likely cyber-espionage.DON’T FORGET TO READ Zero-day vulnerability in SonicWall products actively exploited in the wild",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/multiple-new-flaws-uncovered-in-solarwinds-software-just-weeks-after-high-profile-supply-chain-attack,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Research', 'Windows', 'Network', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'Microsoft', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'Government', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Cyber', 'Warfare']"
no,Florida Healthy Kids blames health insurance data breach on third-party hack,Non-profit alleges that web hosting platform failed to apply security patches,"The Florida Healthy Kids Corporation (FHKC), a US provider of children’s health insurance, has traced a data breach affecting thousands of individuals to a cyber-attack on its web hosting platform.“Several thousand addresses” submitted to the FHKC website along with insurance applications were “inappropriately accessed and tampered with”, according to an FHKC press release published on January 28.Other sensitive personal data submitted with the applications was also potentially exposed “over a seven-year period” in which “significant vulnerabilities” were present on a web hosting service and databases maintained by Jelly Bean Communications Design.In a security alert, FHKC alleged that the “web hosting vendor had failed to apply security patches to its software”.‘No evidence’Potentially exposed data includes full names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, social security numbers, secondary insurance information, familial relationships to the child in question, and financial details such as earnings, alimony, and child support.An investigation by FHKC found no evidence that this “personal information was altered, used, or accessed”, or “removed from the system”.FHKC says it temporarily shut down its website and affected databases after being notified of the incident on December 9. The insurance application function “will remain down” until “restored by our new web hosting vendor”, it adds.Read more of the latest data breach newsAffected individuals – anyone who applied for or renewed insurance coverage online between November 2013 and December 2020 – have been advised to sign up to free fraud alerts and credit freezes with credit reporting agencies and to monitor financial statements and credit reports for suspicious activity.FHKC said it would review its “current security practices and policies to identify ways to strengthen them”, and is “accelerating efforts previously underway to transition the website to a new vendor”.Florida Healthy Kids, a non-profit, public-private partnership, provides subsidized health and dental insurance for children aged 5-18 under the state-run Florida KidCare program.FHKC declined to comment further in response to further queries from The Daily Swig, which has also contacted Jelly Bean Communications Design for further details about the breach.READ MORE British Mensa website hacked after directors quit over ‘data protection failures’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/florida-healthy-kids-blames-health-insurance-data-breach-on-third-party-hack,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Database', 'Security', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Healthcare', 'Finance', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Organizations', 'US', 'Hacking', 'News']"

no,Playing Fetch: New XS-Leak exploits browser redirects to break user privacy,Latest addition to family of side-channel attacks offers a new way of detecting redirects cross-domain,"A new way to perform an XS-Leak side-channel attack has been disclosed.According to Luan Herrera, a researcher and bug bounty hunter with a particular interest in client-side, browser, and extension vulnerabilities, redirect hops can be abused to trigger cross-site leaks.Published on January 29, the researcher’s slides, available in Google Docs and named ‘XS-Leaks in redirect flows’, relate to a talk Herrera gave at the XS-Leaks Summit earlier this year.The research focuses on the XS-Leak family of browser side-channel attacks that can be used to glean important information from a system, bypassing existing security measures to leak sensitive user data.XS-Leak methods rely on measuring the network timing of responses to gather data about website visitors by abusing the communication channels which allow websites and services to communicate with each other in order to piece together a profile of a user or system.Playing fetchHerrera told The Daily Swig that while “slightly” redacted in the slides, the “novel” technique “demonstrates how it is possible to abuse a limitation in the Fetch specification”.The Fetch specification is a way for websites to call resources. A limit is set at 20 redirect hops before a network error is displayed.Due to this limit, attackers could count how many redirect hops happen in a cross-origin redirect by triggering redirects before reaching a victim endpoint, measuring network responses and potentially exposing URL list sizes.Browser defensesThere are a number of ways to detect and defend against cross-origin redirects that can be used to trigger side-channel attacks, including using SameSite cookies, COOP, and framing protections.Vendors are also tackling the issue. Google, for example, is working on Site Isolation in Chrome to reduce the amount of information potentially exposed in a side-channel attack.Herrera said that “prevention of this attack happens in the same way of other common XS-Leaks mitigations ¬– [such as] through the use of SameSite cookies in Lax or Strict mode, [or] Fetch Metadata”.A discussion is currently underway on GitHub concerning whether or not to change the Fetch specification and limit values to mitigate this attack vector.Read more of the latest browser security newsIn related news, back in September Herrera described the results of a challenge to trigger an XSS-based attack with limited influence from JavaScript code.Google information security engineer ‘terjanq’ has also performed interesting research into the XS-Leak family.In November 2019, the researcher described how a cache probing attack could be launched against a select group of Google products, leading to the leak of information including email addresses, tokens, and credit card numbers.RELATED Browser security briefing: Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a ‘post-XSS world’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/playing-fetch-new-xs-leak-exploits-browser-redirects-to-break-user-privacy,"['XS-Leak', 'Browsers', 'Privacy', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Google', 'Chrome', 'XSS', 'Side-channel']"
no,Apple debuts privacy-friendly WebKit tech to measure click-through ad campaigns,Cookie cutter,"Apple is rolling out a new mechanism to measure click-through ad campaigns in a manner that better maintains user privacy.The WebKit browser engine technology – dubbed Private Click Measurement (PCM) – is designed to chart ad clicks across websites and from iOS apps to websites with using privacy-threatening cookies.PCM is being trialed in iOS/iPadOS 14.5 beta releases.In a blog post, Apple WebKit developer John Wilander explains the tech firm’s design goals in developing the technology.“Classic ad attribution on the web is done with cookies carrying user or device IDs,” Wilander explains. “Such attribution constitutes cross-site tracking which WebKit is committed to preventing.“Websites should not be able to attribute data of an ad click and a conversion to a single user as part of large-scale tracking.”Wilander added: “At the same time, we want to support measurement of online advertising.“PCM achieves this trade-off by sending attribution reports with limited data in a dedicated Private Browsing mode without any cookies, delaying reports randomly between 24 and 48 hours to disassociate events in time, and handling data on-device.”Click managementPCM supports 8-bit identifier on the click source side and a 4-bit identifier on the conversion side, features than allow separate campaigns and conversion events to be identified.Wilander latter clarified through Twitter that “PCM data should not be attributed to individual users or devices”.A fraud prevention mechanism through unlinkable tokens is in development but not yet available.Apple proposed the technology as a web standard back in May 2019. It has been the topic of discussion among other browser developers but none to date have taken it up, a necessary precondition for the technology to become a recognized web standard.Read more of the latest browser security newsThe technology measures ad clicks across websites (web-to-web) and from iOS apps to websites.The latter measures ad clicks from iOS and iPadOS apps to Safari.It doesn’t yet work in the opposite direction between web-to-app, though Wilander concluded Apple would be interested in enhancing the technology in this direction.Privacy more generally has high up on the agenda for browser developers.

no,Vue to a kill: XSS vulnerability in Vue.js revealed,Flaw in popular developer tool only addressed after researchers spill the beans,"UPDATED Developers of the Vue.js JavaScript framework have addressed a nasty cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Chrome extension, but only acted after researchers went public in exposing the flaw.Jiantao Li of Singapore-based security consultancy starlabs discovered the flaw before notifying developers of the tool, which has more than one million users among the software development community.After more than two weeks of fruitlessly attempting to privately alert the developers by email, starlabs tried a different approach and posted about the issue on GitHub offering details alongside proof-of-concept code. The different approach yielded swift results and the problem was fixed within three hours.In its advisory, starlabs explains the impact of the vulnerability and how attackers might have exploited it before it was resolved.In devtools-background.js, there is a code injection in the toast function. It can be triggered by postMessage from any tab, which results in universal XSS upon opening the browser’s developer tools(F12).An attacker can host a specially crafted web page to exploit this vulnerability, then convince a user to view the web page and open developer tools(F12) in other Chrome tabs.Vue.js is a javascript framework for building web applications (specifically SPAs or Single Page Applications - a type of modern web app). The vulnerability is in one of the helper extensions that hook in to the browser dev tools (F12) to enhance the debugging for these pages.In response to question from The Daily Swig, Li offered his simplified explanation of the cause and impact of the vulnerability.“It’s basically a code injection vulnerability in a popular browser extension,” the researcher explained. “The cause is that untrusted data gets executed as code.“The UXSS will allow an attacker to execute JavaScript from one domain to any other domain if successfully exploited.”Developers of the Vue.js are yet to respond to a request for comment from The Daily Swig but we will update this story as and when more information comes to hand.This story has been updated to include a clearer explanation of the vulnerable componentYOU MAY ALSO LIKE Browser security briefing: Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a ‘post-XSS world’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vue-to-a-kill-xss-vulnerability-in-vue-js-revealed,"['XSS', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Chrome', 'Google', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Browsers']"
no,German armed forces reveals encouraging start to security vulnerability disclosure program,More than 60 valid reports submitted since start of program three months ago,"The German armed forces (‘Bundeswehr’) has reported a promising start to its recently launched vulnerability disclosure program (VDPBw).Despite the absence of paid bug bounty rewards, more than 30 security researchers have submitted in excess of 60 valid vulnerabilities within 13 weeks of the scheme’s launch, a spokesman for the Bundeswehr told The Daily Swig.These have included cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, misconfiguration, data leakage, and open redirect bugs.Launched in October 2020, the VDPBw applies to internet-facing IT systems and web applications belonging to the German armed forces’ various military branches and civil administration authorities.Not for profit‘SecuNinja’, who currently sits 17th on the Open Bug Bounty hall of fame, submitted vulnerability reports to the Bundeswehr before the VDP was even in place.The German security researcher told The Daily Swig they had been “curious about the security posture of federal agencies”, adding: “A good indicator is usually their website so that was where I started and successfully discovered some vulns.”The Bundeswehr’s “friendly and very professional communication” has encouraged the researcher to continue probing its applications despite the lack of a financial incentive.Bundeswehr CISO Major General Jürgen Setzer“Some of us are not only profit-oriented but also [do] hacking out of curiosity or to learn.“I’m in the lucky situation that I can hack for fun and sacrifice my time for the cause. And sure, it’s always more fun if you’re finding technology you’re interested in.”Also undeterred by the absence of bug bounties, Marcus Mengs, creator of Raspberry Pi USB attack framework P4wnP1, has previously praised the Bundeswehr for rapidly fixing the denial-of-service flaw (PDF) he found via web cache poisoning.“This special kind of vulnerability could be tested without doing harm to the system under test (if done correctly),” he told The Daily Swig.“I tested various targets, which either run a VDP or would accept vulnerability reports in order to improve security.”Bug bounty criticismDespite the program’s auspicious start, Christoph Paul, spokesperson at the Bundeswehr’s German Cyber and Information Domain Service headquarters (KdoCIR), said that there had been criticism from some quarters about the absence of bug bounties.“Adequate financial rewards would still have a lot of formal, legal and financial challenges to solve in a very long process for us within the given framework as a public federal organization,” he told The Daily Swig. “We did not want to wait that long”.In contrast, the “formal or legal aspects were minor” in relation to setting up a bounty-free VDP.RELATED Third edition of US Army bug bounty program prepared for deploymentIncidentally, in a recent interview with The Daily Swig, American bug hunter Tommy DeVoss has described the VDPBw’s similarly bounty-free US counterpart, the US Department of Defense’s VDP on HackerOne, as an ideal training ground for novice bug hunters because of the sheer breadth of technologies in use.Paul said the Bundeswehr had leveraged its “broad formal and informal connections into the national and international cyber community” in drafting its policy.The Bundeswehr’s CISO, Major General Jürgen Setzer, has also reflected on the program’s development in a Q&A published on the Bundeswehr website in December.RECOMMENDED ‘Train the basics’ – Bug bounty hunter ‘Xel’ on forging a lucrative career in ethical hacking",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/german-armed-forces-reveals-encouraging-start-to-security-vulnerability-disclosure-program,"['VDP', 'Vulnerabilities', 'XSS', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Privacy', 'Industry', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques']"
no,British Mensa website hacked after directors quit over ‘data protection failures’,High IQ members group suffers intrusion,"The British Mensa website has suffered a cyber-attack following reports from disgruntled employees that the organization failed to protect its members’ data.British Mensa, which has around 18,000 members, fell victim to an unknown actor last week, forcing its website offline.The site is currently serving a 503 Service Unavailable error, while a static page states it is “under maintenance”.AttackForbes reported that the British Mensa site had been accessed using the credentials of one of the organization’s directors.This comes after two directors quit their roles due to concerns that Mensa was not hashing members’ passwords.Eugene Hopkinson, Mensa’s technology director, told the Financial Times that he stood down after the organization failed to properly protect sensitive data records.Read more of the latest data breach newsMensa, a members’ club for those with an IQ of 148 and above, holds data such as the IQ scores of members and failed applicants, instant messaging conversations on its website, payment card numbers, passwords, email details, and home addresses, according to Hopkinson.Hopkinson accused British Mensa of not hashing the passwords, claiming he has been in a battle with the group on the subject since 2018.Emily Shovlar, a fellow British Mensa director, has also quit her role due to data security concerns.A spokesperson told the Financial Times that passwords were encrypted and have never been sent out in plaintext, adding that the hashing of passwords is “being completed”.The Daily Swig has reached out to British Mensa for more information on the cyber-attack.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Grindr fined $10m for ‘grave’ GDPR violations by Norwegian privacy watchdog",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/british-mensa-website-hacked-after-directors-quit-over-data-protection-failures,"['Passwords', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Organizations', 'Authentication', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Encryption', 'Privacy', 'Network', 'Security', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Finance', 'Database', 'Security', 'Hacking', 'News']"
no,NAT slipstreaming reloaded: Twist on new technique exposes all network devices to the web,Researchers develop new approach to original technique that exposed only the victim’s device,"UPDATED A new variant of the freshly minted NAT slipstreaming attack has emerged that could use unmanaged, internal network devices as a bridgehead to – in the worst-case scenario – ransomware infection.‘NAT slipstreaming’, a packet injection technique recently developed by security researcher Samy Kamkar, allows attackers to bypass a network’s firewall and network address translation (NAT) once a victim clicks on a malicious link.In the original technique – covered by The Daily Swig in November – the NAT is inadvertently duped into opening an incoming TCP/UDP port path from the internet to the device used by the victim.BACKGROUND NAT Slipstreaming hack tricks firewalls and routersDiscovered by Armis researchers Ben Seri and Gregory Vishnepolsky, the new variant of the JavaScript-based attack expands the attack surface by creating “incoming paths to any device on the internal network”, reads a technical blog post.Enterprise-grade NATs or firewalls from Fortinet, Cisco, and HPE were confirmed as vulnerable to varying degrees, with others “likely affected as well”.Unmanaged devicesDevices that lack security capabilities such as robust (or any) authentication for accessing administrative interfaces are particularly vulnerable.These ‘unmanaged’ devices can include office printers that are controllable through a default printing protocol or internal web server, industrial controllers controlled by an unauthenticated protocol, or IP cameras whose feed is accessible with default credentials.Armis has produced videos demonstrating the new variant in action within office and, embedded below, industrial environments.“Once the perimeter is breached, these unpatched, unmanaged devices can be easy targets for attackers to take over, preserve a presence in the network, and act as RATs (remote access tools) through which any further attack can take place,” says Ben Seri.Attackers could also exploit known device vulnerabilities, such as the critical URGENT/11 flaws still unpatched in 97% of vulnerable industrial controllers more than a year after disclosure, said the researchers.New primitivesThe new variant uses additional primitives to bypass browser patches that partially mitigated the original technique.Firstly, “unlike most other ALGs, the H.323 ALG, where supported, enables an attacker to create a pinhole in the NAT/firewall to any internal IP, rather than just the IP of the victim that clicks on the malicious link”.Secondly, “WebRTC TURN connections can be established by browsers over TCP to any destination port. The browser’s restricted-ports list was not consulted by this logic, and was therefore bypassed”.Read more of the latest cybersecurity vulnerability newsThe attacker can also reach ALGs “that were previously unreachable due to the restricted-ports list”.Most products tested were “affected at least in some way”, and in most cases “the effect is pretty much a full bypass of the firewall/NATs protection”, said Seri.Subsequent patches issued for Chrome (on January 6), Edge (January 7), Safari (January 14, so far only in beta), and Firefox (January 26) have added TCP/UDP ports of known ALGs to the restricted-ports list and enforced this list on WebRTC connections.Google Chrome has now also blocked access to websites on another seven TCP ports to further protect users.‘Fundamental change’Although browsers have added “restricted-port lists, same-site origin policy, and other mitigation mechanisms” since Kamkar exploited similar security issues in a 2010 bypass, the expansion of functionality has introduced additional, potentially problematic primitives, says Seri.Beyond short-term browser-side mitigations, a long-term solution “will require a fundamental change of” router and firewall vendors’ implementations, he adds.Security was not the main driver “for the creation of NATs” but rather “mainly a by-product of the potential exhaustion of IPv4 addresses”.Legacy requirements such as ALGs still underpin NAT design and bypassing attacks that “are found again and again.”This article was updated on January 31 with the news that Google has introduced additional mitigations to Chrome.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Machine learning offers fresh approach to tackling SQL injection vulnerabilities",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nat-slipstreaming-reloaded-twist-on-new-technique-exposes-all-network-devices-to-the-web,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Ransomware', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Research', 'Authentication']"

no,Machine learning offers fresh approach to tackling SQL injection vulnerabilities,Academics use reinforcement learning to automate the SQLi-exploitation process,"UPDATED A new machine learning technique could make it easier for penetration testers to find SQL injection exploits in web applications.Introduced in a recently published paper by researchers at the University of Oslo, the method uses reinforcement learning to automate the process of exploiting a known SQL injection vulnerability.While the technique comes with quite a few caveats and assumptions, it provides a promising path toward developing machine learning models that can assist in penetration testing and security assessment tasks.Reinforcement learningReinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning in which an AI model is given the possible actions and rewards of an environment and is left to find the best ways to apply those actions to maximize the reward.“It's inevitable that AI and machine learning are also applied in offensive security,” Laszlo Erdodi, lead author of the paper and postdoctoral fellow at the department of informatics at the University of Oslo, told The Daily Swig.“We decided to try machine learning for penetration testing and we found RL (reinforcement learning) to be a very promising approach. As expected it demonstrated that vulnerabilities to SQL injection can easily be exploited with RL.”Catch up on the the latest SQL injection security newsSQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. Attackers use SQLi exploits to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve or to make modifications to the database.For their proof of concept, the researchers posed the problem as a capture-the-flag competition in which the reinforcement learning agent must obtain a piece of information from a target website through an SQLi vulnerability. The agent’s possible actions are the queries it sends to the system, and the reward is the flag token it must retrieve.Deep Q-learning has shown early promise in enhancing SQLi researchThe researchers started by sending a lot of random queries and analyzing the rewards. Gradually, they developed a model in which they could stage a successful attack within an average of 4-5 queries.Existing automated SQLi tools rely on static, predefined rules, Erdodi says, which can limit their application. “The big advantage of using RL for such problems is that the attack logic is not defined and not static.“The agent only has an action set and it learns the optimal strategy through examples. In the beginning, the agent has to learn trivial things, but as the learning advances it can learn non-trivial or hidden characteristics of the SQL injection exploitation or consider additional characteristics for the exploitation such as manipulating the website content.”‘Some limitations’While the results of the research are seemingly impressive, the work is still in its preliminary stages and the researchers had to simplify the challenge to make it possible for the reinforcement learning agent to tackle it.The challenge assumes a static environment that doesn’t change as the attacker sends queries. The agent also knows the SQL vulnerability and the target database schema beforehand and only needs to find the right query to exploit the flaw.“The current solution has some limitations in terms of the assumptions we made,” Erdodi acknowledged. “On the other hand, these assumptions were only introduced to reduce the complexity of the problem for the first approach.“Considering more and more options for the agent, it increases the action space and the state space.”‘Promising results’The researchers tested two variants of reinforcement learning on the problem. First was Q-learning, a simple reinforcement learning algorithm that creates a table of different actions and reward values as the model explores the problem space. The model succeeded in finding a working solution but required several gigabytes of space to store the Q-table with all the possible actions and states.The second technique was deep Q-learning, which combines Q-learning with deep neural networks. Deep Q-learning can tackle tasks with a more complicated set of states and actions.In recent years, scientists have used deep Q-learning to create AI systems that can solve complex problems, such as mastering complicated games like Go and StarCraft 2.Read more of the latest artificial intelligence security newsThe deep Q-learning model reached a satisfactory performance level on the SQLi challenge much faster than the classic Q-learning agent. The final model was also much smaller, reaching no more than a few hundred kilobytes in size.“Deep Q learning showed very promising results,” Erdodi says. “This approach can be used in the future for more realistic simulations, possibly without the limiting assumptions.“We are currently working on these simulations, where the aim is to use RL in real-word pentesting.“Our first approach was only a proof of concept. As the results are promising we think we are able to solve much more complex problems in the future.”Other work in the field includes a machine learning model developed by the cybersecurity firm NCC Group.NCC uses the support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm to detect SQLi vulnerabilities on web pages based on responses received from servers.Erdodi and his co-authors have submitted their paper for review to the 13th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (Cycon 2021). Their work is part of a wider research program at the University of Oslo that aims to develop intelligent agents for both automated pentesting and automated response.“This perspective on the future of cybersecurity can be called ‘cyberwar of algorithms’, where both the cyber-attacks and the defenses become automated,” Erdodi says.This article has been updated to reference other ML models being used to detect SQLi vulnerabilities.RECOMMENDED ‘Triggerless’ backdoors can infect machine learning models without leaving a trace – research",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/machine-learning-offers-fresh-approach-to-tackling-sql-injection-vulnerabilities,"['Machine', 'Learning', 'SQL', 'Injection', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Database', 'Security', 'Industry', 'News', 'Norway', 'Research']"
no,Domain for popular programming website Perl.com stolen in ‘hack’,Hack rumored to be related to other recent domain takeovers,"UPDATED The domain registration belonging to Perl.com, the popular source of news and information about the Perl programming language, has reportedly been stolen.Brian Foy, a Perl expert who has written several books on the subject, revealed today (January 28) that the domain has been taken over by an unknown actor.He wrote on Reddit: “We’re still trying to unravel this and I can’t get into details. However, it looks like there was an account hack.“I don’t know how long that would take to rewind.”Foy added: “The perl.org and perl.com domains are unrelated and have different rightful registrants, so this doesn’t affect perl.org.”(Not) past its sell by dateA message on the website claims that the domain is for sale and lists contact details for the registrar.This suggests that the registration has expired – however the domain, which is listed as being owned by Tom Christiansen, isn’t due to expire until 2030.It isn’t clear exactly how the malicious hacker was able to gain access to the account, though there is speculation online that the takeover is related to a number of other domain takeover attacks.The domains patterns.com, chip.com, neurologist.com, and piracy.com have all reportedly been taken over in similar circumstances, according to Twitter users.Read more of the latest DNS security newsMultiple attackersFoy, who is leading the domain recovering coordination with Christiansen, the rightful registrant, told The Daily Swig that “multiple actors” are behind the attack, which first began in September.“This domain was hijacked in September but they didn’t change the DNS, which is why nobody noticed immediately,” Foy said.They have not yet regained control of the domain, which has been locked by the registrar.Foy added: “We are evaluating all options for better domain security. In particular, we are instituting backup email address for contacts so that the loss of a domain does not prevent communication.“Additionally, we are setting up systems to monitor the registrar so that we can notice unauthorized transfers.”Call for helpFoy has also reached out to the cybersecurity community asking for help in regaining access to the domain.“We’re looking for people who have actual experience dealing with that situation so we can dispute the transfer.

no,Potential remote code execution vulnerability uncovered in Node.js apps,Local file read and RCE errors have been linked to Express.js and Handlebars usage,"A vulnerability in a Node.js web application framework could be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE).Made public by self-described “wannabe” security researcher Shoeb ‘CaptainFreak’ Patel on January 23, the research suggests that Express.js may be susceptible to local file read errors. When combined with an old version of the Handlebars engine, this flaw could also be exploited to remotely execute malicious code.Handlebars is a popular templating engine for web applications.Speaking to The Daily Swig, Patel said that he decided to hunt for vulnerabilities in Node.js, Express.js, and Handlebars due to his familiarity with the code as a developer.‘Dependency hell’In a technical writeup, Patel said that last week, he “stumbled across” a critical local file read security issue which only required a payload of fewer than 10 lines of code to turn it into a potential RCE exploit.The developer said they were “surprised and disillusioned” by the bug, laying the blame on ‘dependency hell’ – a common development issue experienced when software relies on conflicting dependencies.“To be honest, I should not have been that surprised,” Patel said. “The betrayal by in-built modules, dependencies, and packages have been the reason to introduce numerous security bugs. This is a recurring theme in software security.”Read more of the latest remote code execution security newsTo ascertain if his findings were a “known issue” or not, Patel created a Capture the Flag (CTF) competition on Twitter and shared it with associates across web security, CTF competitions, software engineering, and bug bounty groups.Four participants successfully found the flag, a ‘secret’ layout parameter. Upon further investigation of the odd code in Node.js, Patel found that it was possible to read any file with an extension by reading “from the root views directory + layout, and pass[ing] it to handlebars.compile, which gives us the HTML after compiling the given file which we completely control”.It is then possible to trigger RCE with certain prerequisites, including the use of Handlebars versions 4.0.3 and below. A vulnerability in these versions permitted prototype pollution and RCE payload creation, as shown in Mahmoud Gamal’s RCE payload for Shopify. This issue has been patched in Handlebars versions 4.1.2, 4.0.14, and later.Patel says that potential real-world applications include server compromise through RCE, or at the least, information and source code leaks caused by the local file read vulnerability.“I wrote about it so that the whole NodeJs and web development community [would] know about this quirky behavior in this stack,” Patel commented.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Blind TCP/IP hijacking is resurrected for Windows 7",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/potential-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-uncovered-in-node-js-apps,"['RCE', 'Node.js', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'research', 'tools']"
no,Blind TCP/IP hijacking is resurrected for Windows 7,"Retro cyber-attack returns to haunt widely used, end-of-life operating system","UPDATED Windows 7 is still susceptible to blind TCP/IP hijacking attacks via a vulnerability that a security researcher says he reported to Microsoft eight years ago.Adam Zabrocki (AKA ‘pi3’) has recounted in a blog post how in 2008 he fashioned a proof-of-concept of this venerable attack technique with Windows XP the target.Later, in 2012, he warned Microsoft that all subsequent versions up to Windows 7 – the latest version at that time – contained the same TCP/IP stack flaw that made the attack viable.Although Microsoft deemed the bug “very difficult” to exploit and therefore only fixed it in Windows 8, Zabrocki says that he was able to rework the attack for use against Windows 7 – noting that doing so was even easier than setting up an up-to-date version of the operating system (OS).Launched in 2009, Windows 7 reached its end of life a year ago, meaning that users no longer receive security patches.Read more of the latest Microsoft security newsHowever, roughly one in four PCs are believed to still be running the aging OS, leaving them potentially vulnerable to a form of cyber-attack that was famously deployed against a Japanese security researcher back in 1994.Encryption mitigation“At minimum, this bug allows the attacker to use any Windows 7 machine as a ‘zombie host’ to execute an ‘idle scan’” – which is a “sophisticated TCP port scanning technique because there is no interaction between the attacker computer and the target”, and the “attacker is invisible to the target”, Zabrocki, a former Microsoft security engineer, tells The Daily Swig.“At most, attackers can fully hijack any established TCP connection.”Fortunately, most modern protocols implement encryption that limits the attacker’s options unless they can “correctly generate encrypted messages” – an “unlikely” scenario, says Zabrocki.Nevertheless, there remain “widely deployed protocols which do not encrypt the traffic, e.g, FTP, SMTP, HTTP, DNS, IMAP, and more” that would permit an attacker to “send any commands on behalf of the original client”.Critical protocols such as TELNET that are used in many IoT devices could enable “the most critical scenario”, adds the researcher, with hijacked sessions potentially having a “catastrophic impact”.However, a Microsoft spokesperson told The Daily Swig: “The technique described relies on a set of specific conditions that make it very difficult to execute in a real-world scenario. We do not plan to address this with a security update. We recommend customers use Windows 10 for the best protection.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/blind-tcp-ip-hijacking-is-resurrected-for-windows-7,"['Microsoft', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Vulnerabilities', 'IoT', 'Encryption', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Organizations', 'US', 'Research']"
no,"Firefox 85 protects against supercookie tracking, removes Adobe Flash Player",Updates to Mozilla browser include protections against hard-to-block cross-site trackers,"Firefox 85 has cracked down on so-called ‘supercookies’ by introducing cache partitioning that blocks cross-site tracking.Like ordinary cookies, supercookies are small pieces of data stored on a computer by a web browser that can track a user’s internet footprint and remember information such as payment details or items in a shopping basket.However, supercookies are much more difficult to delete and block.“This makes it nearly impossible for users to protect their privacy as they browse the web,” says Mozilla in a blog post.Read more of the latest browser security newsThe latest update to the Mozilla browser will therefore now partition network connections and caches, isolating them to the website they were created on.This will “greatly reduce the effectiveness” of cache-based supercookies by stopping a tracker from using them across websites, adds Mozilla.Firefox 85 partitions all of the following caches by the top-level site being visited: HTTP cache, image cache, favicon cache, HSTS cache, OCSP cache, style sheet cache, font cache, DNS cache, HTTP Authentication cache, Alt-Svc cache, and TLS certificate cache.To further protect users from connection-based tracking, Firefox 85 also partitions pooled connections, prefetch connections, preconnect connections, speculative connections, and TLS session identifiers.”This applies to all third-party resources embedded on a website, regardless of whether Firefox considers that resource to have loaded from a tracking domain.Unwelcome visitorsMozilla cited an example of how the changes will work in practice, pointing to changes in Firefox’s image cache.Previously, Firefox initially loaded website images from the network, but if the same image was used on subsequent websites visited, it loaded the image from the browser’s local image cache rather than reloading from the network.Mozilla wrote: “Unfortunately, some trackers have found ways to abuse these shared resources to follow users around the web.“To prevent this possibility, Firefox 85 uses a different image cache for every website a user visits. That means we still load cached images when a user revisits the same site, but we don’t share those caches across sites.”YOU MAY LIKE Nmap project becomes latest victim of Google’s ‘wrongful blocking’ of cybersecurity resourcesWhile the move is a positive addition for privacy-conscious users, there are concerns that partitioning will affect the browser’s performance.Mozilla claims that its metrics show a “very modest impact” on page load time ¬– “between a 0.09% and 0.75% increase at the 80th percentile and below, and a maximum increase of 1.32% at the 85th percentile”.The company says that the decrease in speed and bandwidth will be similar to that observed in Google Chrome 86 after it rolled out HTTP cache partitioning in October 2020.Gone in a FlashFirefox 85 has also removed Flash, following in the footsteps of Chrome and Microsoft Edge.The Adobe Flash Player plugin will no longer be available for Firefox users in accordance with the industry-wide plan to deprecate the software.Mozilla previously disabled Flash by default in 2019, due mainly to the fact that Adobe itself announced it was ceasing distribution.The move was also made in part due to the fact that Flash is notorious for being riddled with security bugs.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Browser security briefing: Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a ‘post-XSS world’",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/firefox-85-protects-against-supercookie-tracking-removes-adobe-flash-player,"['Mozilla', 'Browsers', 'Privacy', 'firefox', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Industry', 'News', 'Google', 'Chrome', 'Microsoft', 'Adobe', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software']"
no,Grindr fined $10m for ‘grave’ GDPR violations by Norwegian privacy watchdog,LGBT social networking app reprimanded for ‘take-it-or-leave-it consents’ to sharing sensitive personal data,"UPDATED Grindr, the popular LGBT dating app, has been fined €10 million ($12 million) for GDPR violations by Norway’s data privacy regulator because sensitive user data was apparently shared with third parties without valid consent.The preliminary ruling issued by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) centers on the fact that users had to accept a blanket privacy policy to use the app and were not given a separate opportunity to grant or withhold consent to sharing their data with third parties.Users were also not properly informed about how the data was shared, said the Datatilsynet. The data shared included GPS location and user profile data such as sexual orientation.Datatilsynet director-general Bjørn Erik Thon said these were “grave violations” of GDPR requirements around valid consent and added that it was “imperative” that such “take-it-or-leave-it consents” should “cease”.‘Safe space’“We believe that the fact that someone is a Grindr user speaks to their sexual orientation, and therefore this constitutes special category data that merit particular protection,” the Datatilsynet said in a press release issued yesterday (January 26).Grindr is seen as a safe space, and many users wish to be discrete. Nonetheless, their data have been shared with an unknown number of third parties, and any information regarding this was hidden away – Datatilsynet director-general Bjørn Erik ThonSaid Thon: “Users were not able to exercise real and effective control over the sharing of their data.“Business models where users are pressured into giving consent, and where they are not properly informed about what they are consenting to, are not compliant with the law.”A Grindr spokesperson told The Daily Swig: “Grindr is confident that our approach to user privacy is first-in-class among social applications with detailed consent flows, transparency, and control provided to all of our users.”They said “valid legal consent” had been “retained” from all “EEA users on multiple occasions”, most recently “in late 2020 to align with” the GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework v2.0.The allegations “date back to 2018 and do not reflect Grindr’s current Privacy Policy or practices,” they continued, adding: “We continually enhance our privacy practices in consideration of evolving privacy laws and regulations, and look forward to entering into a productive dialogue with the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.”Shane Wiley, Grindr's chief privacy officer, also penned a defense of the platform’s privacy policies in a blog post published on Monday (January 25).Ezat Dayeh, SE manager at data management vendor Cohesity, told The Daily Swig: “It is ironic timing that this matter becomes public 24 hours before Data Privacy Day. “Organizations of all sizes need to be more accountable and deliver greater trust in how they handle consumer data in exchange for more tailored services or commercial gain. The relationship between consumer and brand only works when trust is in place.“From a compliance perspective on privacy, GDPR was merely the start, not the end goal.”Record-breaking fineGrindr is marketed as the world’s most popular location-based social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people with 13.7 million active users.The penalty amounts to around 10% of the company’s worldwide revenues and, if confirmed, will be the highest GDPR fine ever levied by the Datatilsynet.Grindr has until February 15 to respond to the ruling before a final decision is made.Read more of the latest data privacy newsThe investigation, which stems from a complaint filed against Grindr by the Norwegian Consumer Council in 2020, centers on consent mechanisms in place on the app until April 2020.Datatilsynet said it had not yet assessed whether subsequent changes made to Grindr’s privacy policy were GDPR-compliant.The Norwegian Consumer Council also filed complaints against five third parties that received data from Grindr for marketing purposes: Twitter-owned MoPub, Xandr, OpenX Software, AdColony, and Smaato.The Daily Swig has contacted Grindr for comment on the ruling and will update the article accordingly if we receive a response. This article was updated on January 27 with comments from Ezat Dayeh of Cohesity, then on January 28 with comments from GrindrRECOMMENDED Nmap project becomes latest victim of Google’s ‘wrongful blocking’ of cybersecurity resources",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/grindr-fined-10m-for-grave-gdpr-violations-by-norwegian-privacy-watchdog,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Privacy', 'Europe', 'GDPR', 'Compliance', 'Social', 'Media', 'Legal', 'Mobile']"

no,Prominent cybersecurity researchers among those targeted in North Korean hacking campaign,Industry rocked by APT-linked attacks leveraging zero-day browser and OS vulnerabilities,"Security researchers are being targeted in a widespread hacking campaign attributed to North Korea state-sponsored threat actors.Yesterday (January 25), Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) disclosed details of the operation which it said was conducted by North Korean government-backed assailants.Over the past several months, Google says, the group has targeted security vulnerability researchers with the intent to infect their machines with malware.The malware opened up a backdoor that served to facilitate communication between compromised machines and the attacker-controlled command and control server.Google said that the attack was successful even on computers running up-to-date versions of the Chrome browser and Windows 10, fueling concerns that the malicious hackers are exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities.The malware contained techniques previously seen used by APT38, or Lazarus Group, which has ties to North Korea.Behind the veilGoogle detailed how the threat actors, using aliases including ‘James Willy’, ‘Zhang Guo’, and ‘Billy Brown’, used various tactics to lure potential victims.The group hid behind a fake vulnerability research team, ‘BrownSec3 Labs’, and an accompanying technical blog containing write-ups and analysis of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.The blog also featured guest posts from legitimate researchers, who had seemingly been duped into submitting content in order to give the blog more credibility.“In order to build credibility and connect with security researchers, the actors established a research blog and multiple Twitter profiles to interact with potential targets,” Google’s TAG researchers explained..“They’ve used these Twitter profiles for posting links to their blog, posting videos of their claimed exploits, and for amplifying and retweeting posts from other accounts that they control.”Read more of the latest news about malware and attacksIt was through this channel that the group was able to push malware onto devices owned by numerous unknowing members of the cybersecurity community.A post detailed ‘DOS2RCE: A New Technique to Exploit V8 NULL Pointer Dereference Bug’ was uploaded onto the popular /netsec subreddit, which is well known for sharing credible exploits and original security content.A victim would simply have to click a link to the blog, and “shortly thereafter, a malicious service was installed on the researcher’s system and an in-memory backdoor would begin beaconing to an actor-owned command and control server”, said Google.A screenshot of the malicious blog shared on /netsec that contained the malwareUnsociable networkAnother route to compromise saw the attackers reach out to security researchers on social media sites including Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, Discord, and Keybase, asking to collaborate on exploits.The malicious actor would then send them a Visual Studio project file which contained the malware.One such victim, researcher Alejandro Caceres, was contacted by ‘James Willy’ on Twitter, who approached him to help with a fake zero-day vulnerability.Caceres wrote: “After providing a writeup on root cause analysis I realized the visual studio project he gave me was backdoored.”He added: “Anyway, yes I was hacked. No, no customer information was leaked, this was on a private VM [virtual machine] for this exact reason.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Critical zero-day RCE in Microsoft Office 365 awaits third security patchSecurity researcher Richard Johnson was also hit in the widespread attack. He tweeted: “The vulnerability was real and complex to trigger. Fortunately, I only ran it in VM.”Johnson added that in the end that the VM disk he was using was corrupted, and so the file “self-imploded”.Elsewhere, researcher @BushidoToken was targeted by a Twitter user with the alias ‘z0x55g’. He wrote: “I can confirm I was targeted by ‘z0x55g’ via Twitter DMs asking about browser and Windows kernel 0day vulnerability research.“I guess it was because I had commented about the Defender RCE and used to have #0day in my bio. But yikes! Stay vigilant.”Screenshots of two of the accounts controlled by the malicious hackersMultiple targetsUnsurprisingly, news of the brazen and far-reaching campaign has rocked the cybersecurity industry. The /netsec subreddit in which the malicious blog was posted has 399,000 members, and this doesn’t account for anyone who might have stumbled upon blog post via another channel.“This is your regular reminder that to security researchers that you too are a target for APTs,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Freedom Foundation, wrote on Twitter.Google has included a full list of the actor-controlled sites and accounts in the blog post, as well as details about the host IOCs.“If you are concerned that you are being targeted, we recommend that you compartmentalize your research activities using separate physical or virtual machines for general web browsing, interacting with others in the research community, accepting files from third parties, and your own security research,” advised Google.Since the malware potentially exploits zero-days in Google Chrome, the search engine giant reiterated that it offers cash rewards for vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild under its bug bounty program.Google said: “We encourage anyone who discovers a Chrome vulnerability to report that activity via the Chrome [Vulnerability Rewards Program] submission process.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE SonicWall updates users after ‘highly sophisticated’ cyber-attack leverages zero-day vulnerabilities",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/prominent-cybersecurity-researchers-among-those-targeted-in-north-korean-hacking-campaign,"['Zero-day', 'Google', 'Malware', 'North', 'Korea', 'Industry', 'News', 'Windows', 'Microsoft', 'Chrome', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cybercrime', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Phishing', 'Network', 'Security', 'Social', 'Media', 'Asia', 'Research', 'Browsers']"
no,Nmap project becomes latest victim of Google’s ‘wrongful blocking’ of cybersecurity resources,Open source tool was incorrectly labeled as a threat by Chrome’s Safe Browsing program last week,"The Nmap project has been wrongfully labeled as a cybersecurity “threat” by Google Chrome’s Safe Browsing service.The incident is the latest example of legitimate security tools becoming categorized in the same way as malware, phishing code, or malicious exploits.Network Mapper (Nmap) is an open source scanner for network discovery and security audits. The award-winning tool has also been featured in numerous movies.On January 21, the Nmap team said in a tweet that Google Chrome had been warning users that a decade-old version of Ncat software was a ‘harmful’ program.To make matters worse, the entire directory was blocked, containing 458 other files – including the latest Nmap release.A week prior, the browser also blocked 24-year-old source code files in the project’s historical archive.Speaking to The Daily Swig, the developer and maintainer of Nmap, Gordon ‘Fyodor’ Lyon said that the cases highlight Google “wield[ing] such vast power so carelessly […] especially since their warning message tells user our site is ‘dangerous’ and ‘contains harmful programs’ when it is really Google’s own errors”.Digging deeperWhen the block was discovered, Lyon first set out to understand what file had been flagged and why.This can be a time consuming and complicated process as it requires specific DNS TXT records to be added to the domain in question to prove ownership before the tech giant will provide further information.Lyon then had to decide how to respond and whether or not to attempt to appeal the decision while also inundated with meetings and his existing workload.RELATED Learning curve: YouTube’s LiveOverflow brings ethical hacking to the massesThere were two methods – remove a file that was still “useful to many people”, or try to convince Google that its system incorrectly flagged a legitimate cybersecurity resource as malware.In the end, the developer says, he simply “got mad” and tweeted out his frustration to the masses.The tweet was fired to 130,000 followers and an associate at Google Security spotted the message. The issue was then personally escalated, although the developer added that others may have seen the tweet and helped, too.It took less than an hour for the warning to be removed after the tweet was published.“We shouldn’t have to do this and it may have only worked for us due to luck or popularity,” Lyon commented. “Other organizations might have a harder time.”Google’s Safe Browsing program was launched in 2007 to help protect users from malicious contentSecurity pinch pointsThe Nmap warning is the latest in a string of mislabeling incidents by Google Safe Browsing. While the program is intended to alert users to dangerous websites and downloads, others have noted that the tech giant’s algorithms have the power to severely impact innocent businesses and developers.On YouTube, cybersecurity expert and the creator of educational resources Stök has been flagged twice for ‘malicious’ links.Stök told us that to be a YouTube partner you must adhere to the platform’s policies, and due to a “global misunderstanding in the rhetoric that hackers = cybercriminals”, the YouTube ad business and cybersecurity content can clash.READ MORE Burp Suite tips from power user and ‘hackfluencer’ StökIt is possible to avoid certain trigger words or phrases to try and stay clear of algorithms that can prompt takedowns and to stay ad-worthy, but the industry is in a “grey zone [and] sh*t happens”, according to the content creator.“Even though it sucks that channels get taken down and content gets flagged, it’s the game we play,” Stök said.“And to be honest, there really isn’t any true alternative if you want to be able to actually live on your craft and get paid for what you do, without having to charge the end user. There is no free lunch.”On the vendor side, Google Chrome has also incorrectly flagged PortSwigger Web Security’s Burp Suite apps in the BApp Store on more than one occasion.“We have processes in place to monitor how our website is performing and take steps to rectify the errors in mislabeling via Chrome or Google Search as they arise,” commented Kieron Hughes, director of organic performance at PortSwigger*.The Daily Swig has reached out to Google but has not heard back at the time of publication.*PortSwigger is the Daily Swig’s parent companyRECOMMENDED Introducing Malvuln.com – the first website ‘exclusively dedicated’ to revealing security vulnerabilities in malware",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nmap-project-becomes-latest-victim-of-googles-wrongful-blocking-of-cybersecurity-resources,"['Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Industry', 'News', 'Browsers', 'Network', 'Security', 'Analysis', 'Phishing', 'Malware', 'Google', 'DNS', 'Organizations', 'Hacking', 'Tools']"

no,Intel issues earnings report early after sensitive data was ‘inadvertently made publicly accessible’,Chipmaker initially thought its website had been hacked,"UPDATED Chip manufacturing giant Intel has admitted that the data breach which prompted the early release of its quarterly earnings report was due to an internal error, according to reports.On Thursday (January 21), the Silicon Valley company released its fourth-quarter report for 2021 six minutes before the stock market closed instead of afterwards as originally planned.This came after the company was notified that an infographic detailing its findings “was circulating outside the company”, an Intel spokesperson told the Financial Times (FT).Read more of the latest data breach newsIntel initially believed that its website had been hacked. The company’s chief financial officer, George Davis, told the FT that they “put [our earnings] out as soon as we were aware” that “an infographic was hacked off of our PR newsroom site”.However, by Friday (January 22) the company had changed its assessment. “The URL of our earnings infographic was inadvertently made publicly accessible before publication of our earnings and accessed by third parties,” it said in a new statement reported by various outlets.“Intel’s network was not compromised, and we have adjusted our process to prevent this in the future.”In response to a query from The Daily Swig, Intel said: “We are investigating reports that non-authorized access may have been obtained to one graphic in our earnings material. Once we became aware of these reports, we made the decision to issue our earnings announcement a brief time before the originally scheduled release time.”Share warningWhether gained via malicious hacking or by accidental public exposure, cybercriminals who obtain such sensitive financial information can “make a quick profit by selling information to investors, or to use the information for their own benefit,” Hugo van den Toorn, manager for offensive security at Outpost24, told The Daily Swig.“Both the information that is leaked and the breach itself may have a direct impact on a company’s share price. This can be used to an adversary’s advantage by either investing with prior insider knowledge or by leveraging a sudden drop in share prices caused by disclosure of the breach.”The company’s stock price had fallen by more than 9% when markets closed on Friday.Stuart Reed, UK director for Orange Cyberdefense, commended Intel’s prompt response.“Intel has seemingly avoided any legal, financial, reputational, and regulatory consequences that might have ensued as a result of its earnings being in the public domain by detecting the breach early, and responding effectively to minimize the value of the sensitive information in the hands of illicit actors,” he told The Daily Swig.The earnings results themselves had “significantly exceeded our expectations, capping off our fifth consecutive year of record revenue”, said Intel CEO Bob Swan (PDF).This article was updated on January 26 with comments from Intel.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Reserve Bank of New Zealand apologizes for ‘significant’ data breach",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/intel-issues-earnings-report-early-after-sensitive-data-was-inadvertently-made-publicly-accessible,"['Data', 'Leak', 'Intel', 'Finance', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'North', 'America']"
no,KEMTLS: Cloudflare trials new encryption mechanism in anticipation of post-quantum TLS shortcomings,"Devised by a global team of academics, KEMTLS uses key encapsulation instead of signatures for authentication","With quantum computing looming on the horizon, Cloudflare says it has been trialing the KEMTLS protocol and plans to use post-quantum cryptography for most internal services by the end of this year.The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which currently secures most internet connections, consists of a key exchange authenticated by digital signatures used to encrypt data at transport.But, says Cloudflare, with the advent of quantum computing, TLS in its current form will be broken. While various new post-quantum cryptography algorithms have been proposed, their parameters are too large to be used for establishing efficient connections on the web.The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently evaluating potential candidates, but the agency isn’t expected to make its choice until 2023.What is KEMTLS?KEMTLS is an alternative to the TLS 1.3 handshake that uses key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) instead of signatures for server authentication.The protocol was unveiled (PDF) in 2020 by Peter Schwabe of the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, Germany; Douglas Stebila of the University of Waterloo, Canada; and Thom Wiggers of Radboud University, Netherlands.RELATED When TLS hacks you: Security friend becomes a foe“We have so far tested KEMTLS only in a lab setting,” Schwabe tells The Daily Swig.“The next step before any large-scale deployment is to run KEMTLS in a small-scale experiment on confined real-world internet infrastructure to get a better understanding of the benefits and potential problems that come with deploying it on larger scale. Such an experiment is precisely what Cloudflare’s plans are about.”Efficient authentication“Alternative authentication techniques affect performance, and drop-in replacements are not always possible,” Sofía Celi, cryptography engineer with Cloudflare, tells The Daily Swig.“However, KEMTLS is more efficient, as less data that needs to be transmitted as part of the connection.“This does not mean that connections that use KEMTLS will be as efficient and fast as the ones we have today when using TLS 1.3, but it will mean that they will not be catastrophically slow.”KEMTLS offers a post-quantum alternative to the TLS 1.3 handshakePost-quantum visionKEMTLS has a similar structure to TLS 1.3 and, like TLS, allows clients to send encrypted data on the third message of the handshake.“It achieves full post-quantum security for the TLS 1.3 handshake, in the sense that it encrypts the connections and also authenticates them using post-quantum algorithms,” says Celi.“It is worth noting that post-quantum authentication for the entire connection requires more invasive WebPKI changes.”Read more of the latest encryption security newsAnd, says Celi, it achieves full quantum security for the TLS 1.3 handshake as it not only encrypts and secures the connections, but also allows both client and server to be authenticated.“This means that when using KEMTLS in a world with quantum machines, the connection will be secure and the authenticity properties of it are no worse than vanilla TLS,” she says.Positive exchangeCloudflare says it’s currently working to see how efficiently KEMTLS works with regular connections and is prepared to use it once quantum computers arrive.“The fact that post-quantum signatures [are] likely to be the major contributor to increasing the volume of data exchanged means it makes sense to look for authentication mechanisms that do not rely on signatures,” Professor Alan Woodward of the University of Sussex’s Surrey Centre for Cyber Security tells The Daily Swig.DEEP DIVE HTTP/3: Everything you need to know about the next-generation web protocol“It’s already done in some secure messaging apps with end-to-end encryption in the initial key exchange, but they’re not suitable for TLS due to assumptions about who knows about which keys.“Whether this proves to be the right solution is very much why it’s important that organisations like Cloudflare trial it at scale, and it will at least show the viability of using TLS without signatures using alternative authentication schemes based on key exchange mechanisms.”",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/kemtls-cloudflare-trials-new-encryption-mechanism-in-anticipation-of-post-quantum-tls-shortcomings,"['Encryption', 'Privacy', 'TLS', 'Authentication', 'Browsers', 'Research', 'Cloudflare', 'Industry', 'News', 'Analysis', 'Mobile', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security']"

no,Russian ‘security researcher’ pleads guilty to running cybercrime e-commerce platform Deer.io,‘One-stop shopping for criminals’,"A Russian national has pleaded guilty before a US federal court to being the administrator of a website that helped cybercrooks build illicit webstores.Kirill Victorovich Firsov, 29, was charged in relation to his role in the operation of Deer.io, a nefarious equivalent of legitimate e-commerce platforms like Shopify and Magento.Firsov, who submitted the plea yesterday (January 21), “was well-compensated” for his role, according to a press release issued by the Department of Justice (DoJ).Annual sales of $17mDeer.io provided cybercriminals with a channel for selling stolen credentials, payment card details, and other illicit goods and services until it was shut down following Firsov’s arrest in March 2020.During its investigation, the FBI found “thousands of compromised accounts posted for sale, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) files containing full US Social Security Numbers, dates of birth and victim addresses”.Many of the victims were based in the US and Europe.US attorney Robert Brewer said the platform offered “one-stop shopping for criminals”.Launched in October 2013, the e-commerce site hosted around 3,000 digital stores and generated sales exceeding $17 million as of March 2020, said the DoJ.Off-the-shelf cybercrime shopFor a monthly subscription of RUB800 (around $12.50) paid for in bitcoin or via Russian-based money transfer systems, cybercriminals could build their storefront, upload products and services for sale, and configure cryptocurrency wallets to collect payments.Shop owners could choose a store name based on domains such as Deer.io, Deer.st, or Deer.is, or choose a custom name.READ MORE Magecart attacks: Cat-and-mouse game continues between cybercrooks and law enforcementProspective customers could readily access the website over the internet, then browse popular shops or use a search function on the homepage to browse various illicit wares.The FBI found no evidence of legitimate goods or services for sale on Deer.io storefronts, and said Firsov had advertised the service on other cybercrime forums, according to a previous DoJ filing.White hat exploitsThe defendant’s Twitter bio still describes Firsov as a security researcher and web developer.In a trawl of his tweets, security journalist Brian Krebs found that Firsov had uncovered a slew of serious security flaws in Telegram, an encrypted messaging platform popular with cybercriminals, and tweets announcing victories in several capture-the-flag hacking competitions.Read more of the latest cybercrime newsSimilar previous FBI successes, achieved in collaboration with other international law enforcement agencies, include the shutdowns of stolen-data search engine WeLeakInfo.com in 2020, and darknet marketplaces xDedic and ‘Wall Street’ in 2019.“The seizure of the Deer.io website and conviction of Firsov is an example of the FBI cyber program’s investigative prowess and jurisdictional reach in order to identify, locate and bring to justice anyone who attempts to profit from harm to US persons, businesses and infrastructure,” said Suzanne Turner, special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Diego field office.Firsov is due for sentencing on April 12 and faces a maximum jail term of 10 years and a maximum fine of $250,000.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/russian-security-researcher-pleads-guilty-to-running-cybercrime-e-commerce-platform-deer-io,"['Cybercrime', 'Fraud', 'E-Commerce', 'Retail', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Privacy', 'US', 'Russia', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Finance', 'Mobile', 'Cryptocurrency']"
no,Internet industry group i2Coalition throws weight behind illegal VPN crackdown,Advocacy group supports US authorities in deterring cybercrime,"VPN providers should adhere to a minimum standard of ethics to deter cybercriminals from taking advantage of their privacy-enhancing software.That is the stance taken by industry group the i2Coalition, which has declared its support of a government takedown of illegitimate Virtual Private Network services.The US-based i2Coalition – also known as the Internet Infrastructure Coalition – was formed in 2011 to advocate for public policy on the behalf of technology companies.Its members include web hosting companies, data centers, domain registrars and registries, cloud infrastructure providers, managed services providers, and others.The coalition has thrown its weight behind the US government in the drive to clamp down on cybercriminals using IP address-masking services to evade authorities.Working for the clampdownThe announcement came after the US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced it had shut down three VPN services that it said were used to facilitate criminal activity.The international coordinated operation saw three domains, which offered “bulletproof hosting services”, a term the DoJ described as being “intentionally designed to provide web hosting or VPN services for criminal activity”.RELATED Safe-Inet: VPN service for cybercriminals taken down in law enforcement bustA statement from the VPN Trust Initiative (VTI) – a subgroup of the i2Coalition – reads: “The members of the VTI, which include the world’s leading VPN providers, work diligently every day to deter criminal activity.“Any technology can be misused, and the overwhelming majority of VPN usage is for legal and legitimate purposes, and millions of consumers and businesses rely on VPNs for essential online protection.”Best practicesThe VPN Trust Initiative, which was formed in September 2020, developed a set of best practices for vendors to ensure they promote safety and privacy within the online community.Guidelines include having an open approach to transparency regarding the companies’ practices, protecting users’ privacy, and abiding by valid legal requests.Christian Dawson, executive director of the i2Coalition, told The Daily Swig: “One of the reasons we put together this framework for VPN providers is that we realized that not every provider was approaching these problems with the same level of professionalism as well as sensible business and technical practices.Read more of the latest cybersecurity policy and legislation news“The members of our VPN group set out to create a floor, and not a ceiling, that outlined the minimum requirements for being considered a responsible member of the VPN community.“Some of our providers are well above the bar we set, but not every provider out there is above it.”Good people, smart policyLast year “solidified” the coalition’s beliefs that cybersecurity issues do not start and end with technical dilemmas, said Dawson.Multiple risks were highlighted in 2020 that could have had profound consequences on US policy, such as the fears surrounding hacking during the Presidential election race and multiple frauds associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.“In the past year we’ve seen continued increases in ransomware, phishing, social hacking, and many other issues that wreak havoc with people’s lives,” Dawson told The Daily Swig.He added: “Over the course of 2020, our belief that cybersecurity isn’t just a technical problem was further solidified.“Effective cybersecurity responses are managed by good people and smart policy. They preface their reactive responses with proactive planning.“Our work has been centered on building trust [with] the parts of the industry that earn it – but make no mistake, that trust must be earned. That does, and will always, start with good people and smart policy.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Biden administration looks to shake up US cybersecurity policy",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/internet-industry-group-i2coalition-throws-weight-behind-illegal-vpn-crackdown,"['VPN', 'Privacy', 'US', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Government', 'Industry', 'News', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Coronavirus', 'Organizations', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Election', 'Security', 'Encryption', 'Compliance', 'Legal', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Browsers', 'Hardware', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Telecommunications']"
no,KindleDrip: Critical vulnerabilities in Amazon Kindle e-reader gave attackers free rein over user accounts,Researcher reveals how chained bugs resulted in complete e-reader takeover,"A researcher detailed how he chained a series of vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on an Amazon Kindle e-reader.Researcher Yogev Bar-On, of Readlmode Labs, who discovered the now-patched issue, detailed in a blog post published today (January 21) how he was able to access a victim’s Amazon account simply by knowing their email address.Amazon has released fixes for the bugs, which can be found in Kindle firmware version 5.13.4.Drip-down effectThe attack – dubbed ‘KindleDrip’ – relied on three vulnerabilities found in the e-reader, Bar-On told The Daily Swig.The first bug allowed a spoofed email address to bypass authentication checks, enabling a malicious e-book file to be sent to a victim’s device.Amazon’s ‘Send To Kindle’ feature gives users the option to send a purchase directly to their device using a list of pre-approved senders such as their Kindle email address, which is automatically generated by Amazon.Read more of the latest bug bounty newsBar-On, however, was able to spoof a user’s Kindle email address and send an e-book to their device, bypassing authentication checks.There was no indication that the e-book was received from an email message, and the e-book also appeared on the home page of the Kindle with a cover image of the attacker’s choice – “which makes phishing attacks much easier”, Bar-On said.The spoofed email was “specifically the email address Amazon generated for the device”, Bar-On told The Daily Swig. He also noted how this email address can be predicted, since Amazon uses the format name@kindle.com.The chainThe second issue was a vulnerability in the way that the Kindle parses the image format JPEG XR, which can be loaded via a web browser.If the user clicks a link in the e-book, such as one in the table of contents, it will open a browser window that contains the malicious JPEG XR image.The image is parsed and runs arbitrary code under the context of a weak user.A third vulnerability, a privilege escalation bug, is exploited and the attacker’s payload runs as root.Chained together, the three bugs could enable the attacker to achieve RCE and send back the private credentials to themselves.RewardA proof-of-concept video shows how Bar-On was able to carry out the attack, which concluded by successfully accessing the victim’s Amazon credentials and logging into their account:Bar-On was awarded an $18,000 bug bounty payout from Amazon, which patched the bug on December 10, 2020, within a 90-day disclosure timeline.Kindle customers are urged to update to protect against the vulnerabilities.Amazon was “responsive and cooperative”, the researcher said.“Finding the vulnerabilities and exploiting them was not easy, but once it was done the exploitation was very simple to execute,” Bar-On added.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE ‘Train the basics’ – Bug bounty hunter ‘Xel’ on forging a lucrative career in ethical hacking",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/kindledrip-critical-vulnerabilities-in-amazon-kindle-e-reader-gave-attackers-free-rein-over-user-accounts,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Amazon', 'RCE', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Passwords', 'Phishing', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'E-Commerce', 'Organizations', 'Research']"
no,Imminent Joker’s Stash demise likely to spawn growth of rival cybercrime forums,Know when to fold ’em,"Carders, fraudsters, and other cybercriminals will be quick to migrate to other nefarious platforms if infamous darknet site the Joker’s Stash closes as promised next month, according to experts in the fight against cybercrime.Joker’s Stash has grown since its inception back in 2014 to become the dark web’s biggest compromised payment card data sale site. Its operator announced plans to bring down the shutters on the site on February 15.The seizure of proxy servers behind the site by law enforcement last month, as well as unconfirmed reports that its unknown operator was hospitalized with coronavirus in October, may be behind the closure.Villainous hiveAccording to Group-IB threat intelligence data, in 2020 Joker’s Stash accounted for over 40% of all stolen bank card data traded in underground markets.Group-IB’s head of cybercrime research unit Dmitry Shestakov commented: “Maintaining supply chains is essential for carders, hence, they are likely to migrate to other platforms.“It’s of note, however, that Joker’s Stash’s closest rival held just above 15% of the carding market in 2020.”RELATED Safe-Inet: VPN service for cybercriminals taken down in law enforcement bustThe Singapore-based threat intelligence and digital forensics firm has been tracking incidents of cybercrime enabled by Joker’s Stash, such as credit card dumps, for some years.“Joker’s Stash has been one of the most notorious underground cardshops for trafficking in stolen payment data,” Shestakov told The Daily Swig.“It was used by carders to monetize major breaches of the past years – for instance, the biggest single card database ever on sale on dark net, [when] 1.3 million card records of primarily Indian banks [were] uploaded to the marketplace in October 2019,” he added.Business as usualThe demise of Joker’s Stash – assuming it happens – is unlikely to have much on an effect on demand for, and trade in, compromised payment card data.Shestakov predicted: “The demand for stolen bank card data will remain, that’s why other carders, not connected with Joker’s Stash, will naturally shift to new marketplaces themselves, with no need for these venues to attract them.”Cybercrime watchers Gemini Advisory agreed with this assessment, and noted that the “underground payment card economy is likely to remain largely unaffected by this shutdown”.They added that while Joker’s Stash was the largest in the carding space, it “also exhibited a severe decline in the volume of compromised records posted over the past six months”.Read more of the latest cybercrime newsGroup-IB declined to offer the names of specific marketplaces that may be in the ascendency in “order to not advertise them and generate traffic for cybercriminals”.The company did however say that these services all make an illicit income in much the same way as the soon-to-shut Joker’s Stash.Shestakov explained: “Joker’s Stash business model in which the cardshop owners receive interest from the data sold on the marketplace by third party vendors is not unique and [is] quite widespread among other platforms.“Payment data traders have access to a cardshop’s seller panel through which they can upload bank cards and then monitor their profits and how many records have been sold.”RECOMMENDED Magecart attacks: Cat-and-mouse game continues between cybercrooks, law enforcement",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/imminent-jokers-stash-demise-likely-to-spawn-growth-of-rival-cybercrime-forums,"['Cybercrime', 'Dark', 'Web', 'Fraud', 'Finance', 'Legal', 'E-Commerce', 'Research', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Singapore', 'Asia', 'India']"
no,"Pwnable Document Format: Windows PDF viewers outperformed by browser, macOS, Linux counterparts",Security researchers document their exploits in picking apart dozens of PDF software brands,"The vast majority of the most popular Windows-native PDF viewers were vulnerable to multiple attack techniques exploiting standard PDF features, a team of security researchers has discovered.Several PDF software brands were vulnerable to the most serious attacks, which resulted in local file leakage, file write access, and remote code execution (RCE), academics from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany found.PDF viewers built into leading web browsers and applications for macOS and Linux were only susceptible to comparatively trivial attacks such as denial of service (DoS).The viewers incorporated into Safari and Edge, meanwhile, were the only applications among 28 tested to resist all exploits, which targeted features that “directly or indirectly allow access to a file handle”, as a blog post explains.Susceptible to eight of 10 attack techniques, the worst culprits overall were PDF-Xchange Viewer and PDF-Xchange Viewer for Windows.PDFelement and iSkysoft, prone only to DoS, were honorable exceptions to the otherwise unimpressive Windows scorecard.‘Code execution by design’“I was surprised how many viewers did straightforwardly implement ‘code execution by design’ – because they simply followed the PDF reference and thereby introduced a dangerous feature (the ‘Launch action’) without, [for example], correctly asking the user for confirmation,” Jens Müller, one of the researchers, told The Daily Swig.As a result, the blog post describes how a malicious file could successfully “be specified by a local path, a network share, a URL, or a file embedded within the PDF document itself” against six of 18 Windows viewers probed.RELATED ‘Shadow Attacks’ can manipulate contents of signed PDF docsInformation disclosure attacks, meanwhile, could be used to track PDF document use “by silently invoking a connection to the attacker’s server once the file is opened, or to leak PDF document form data, local files, or NTLM credentials to the attacker”.The most dangerous technique, successfully deployed against three Windows viewers and partially successful against another three, exploited various methods defined by the PDF standard for embedding external files or accessing files on the host’s file system.“If a malicious document managed to firstly read files from the victim’s disk and secondly, send them back to the attacker, such behavior would arguably be critical,” reads the blog post.Data manipulation attacksData manipulation attacks involved silently modifying form data, displaying different content depending on the application used to open the document, and exploiting ambiguity in how the PDF standard allows form data submission to external webservers in order to write to local files on the host’s file system.Attackers successfully executed one or both DoS techniques against every single application, bar the Safari and Edge viewers. This included exploiting how document elements reference themselves and other similar elements to cause an ‘infinite loop’, and a twist on the ‘zip bomb’ attack that compresses stream objects rather than zip files.Read more of the latest information security research from around the world‘A better choice’Müller said the “more severe issues should be fixed by now”, while “less impactful issues such as form modification are basically features”, and will therefore not likely be remedied.He suggests that applications built into browsers, which offer sandboxing protections, “may be a better choice for a suspicious document than a native third-party PDF viewer”.The research also highlights an education gap around the risks posed by what Müller refers to as “a quite complex data format with tons of interesting features”.“For example, people are aware that Office files (e.g in email attachments) can contain macros, but public knowledge of similar functionality in PDF documents is less widespread,” he noted.The other researchers involved are Dominik Noss, Christian Mainka, Vladislav Mladenov, and Jörg Schwenk.RECOMMENDED XSS for PDFs – New injection technique offers rich pickings for security researchers",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/pwnable-document-format-windows-pdf-viewers-outperformed-by-browser-macos-linux-counterparts,"['Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Microsoft', 'RCE', 'Windows', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'Browsers', 'Apple', 'Linux', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Network', 'Security']"
no,‘Train the basics’ – Bug bounty hunter ‘Xel’ on forging a lucrative career in ethical hacking,Switzerland-based security researcher shares the secrets of his success,"INTERVIEW Ranking among the top 10 hackers on bug bounty platform YesWeHack’s all-time leaderboard, Raphaël Arrouas’ methodologies will be of interest to security researchers of all abilities.Arrouas, who lives in Switzerland and hacks as ‘Xel’, started bug hunting in early 2019 and joined Paris-based YesWeHack in October 2019.Speaking to The Daily Swig, he shares the secrets of his success, offers tips for bug hunting newbies, and reflects on the pleasing progress of Europe’s crowdsourced security market.How did you get into cybersecurity and hacking in particular?I first started looking into computer security when I was 14, but it wasn’t until I majored in cybersecurity at the Centrale Supélec engineering school, where I had the project to become a penetration tester, that I started to learn a lot about offensive security.My hacking expertise was first self-learned in parallel with my training at the engineering school, and sharpened during my career as a penetration tester.After three years’ working as a penetration tester I quit my job to do bug hunting full-time, as it appeared to me to be an opportunity that I shouldn’t miss out on.DON’T FORGET TO READ Bug bounty leader Clément Domingo on cybersecurity in Africa, hacking events, and chaining vulnerabilities for maximum impactYou’re counted among the top 10 hackers on YesWeHack’s leaderboard, so you’re obviously making good returns, but did it feel like a big gamble at the time?It was a bit of a gamble because I had only done three months of bug hunting before I quit my job.But in the computer security fields, you know that if you’re looking for jobs you’re going to find one anyway [given the skills shortage], so it’s not that much of a gamble.I started making good money pretty fast. I dedicated some time at first to the Swisscom program, which was the first major bug bounty program in Switzerland.I felt this was a good opportunity to invest time in local companies and it really paid off in the end.Swiss hacker Xel is ranked on YesWeHack’s top 10 leaderboardHow do you account for your success?I have no commuting time so I can work at any hour of the day and it really focuses my efforts.My training as a general engineer really helps me too, because I have confidence in knowing how parts of a system are connected and where I should conduct my research.Read more of the latest hacking newsI also benefit from my experience as a penetration tester, because I’ve been able to interact with a lot of corporate applications, which you don’t get a lot of practice with through learning platforms.When I start working on a bug bounty program I am often familiar with the type of technologies deployed in the scope.Are there particular types of bugs that tend to favor?I tend to focus on complex web applications, which have a lot of entry points for exploitation, and critical bugs.When a new program is published, I tend not to search for low-impact bugs immediately, because a good proportion of hunters go for the low-hanging fruit first, and there is more competition.Instead, I prefer to investigate the application in depth, and would rather spend time working out the details of an exploit with a critical impact.Focusing on impact rather than quantity allows me to dedicate more time to researching vulnerabilities in depth and learn something in the process. And it is worthwhile considering the payout scales, which usually greatly favor high and critical impact vulnerabilities.I don’t only focus on critical vulnerabilities, though; I report all kinds of bugs.   I have no commuting time so I can work at any hour of the day – XelHow do you choose your programs?Usually, I estimate whether the scope seems to be well secured already or whether there are a lot of things to find. Therefore, I can estimate the number of bugs I can detect in a short time versus the bounty payouts and make my choice.I like Java applications as well because these are usually treasure troves for critical bugs in my experience.I also like building relationships with the teams that operate programs and the bug bounty platforms themselves. I believe it is important to build trust with the program owners, which sometimes encourages them to include more of the infrastructure within the scope.What was the biggest bounty you’ve ever earned?I found a series of zero-day RCE [remote code execution] vulnerabilities on the same product over one weekend, which netted me CHF32,000 ($35,000).The highest amount for an individual bug I had was CHF10,000 ($11,000). I reached that amount several times for various vulnerabilities, including another remote code execution vulnerability.The biggest impact I can think of is an unauthenticated RCE I identified last year on a product called Tufin SecureChange. This is a firewall orchestrator, so you can imagine the kind of impact it could have if exploited.What hacking tools do you tend to use?Mainly Burp Suite. And I select tools that allow me to exploit specific vulnerabilities, but my tests are done manually in general.RECOMMENDED ‘As long as people are the ones writing code, there’s going to be insecure code’ – Tommy DeVoss on his post-jail bug bounty exploitsHave you encountered any problems with the coordinated disclosure process? If so, what happened?I’ve encountered issues with programs that were not willing to pay what was advertised, without understandable justification. When this happened, I usually immediately stopped working with the program.Companies that have been introduced to the bug bounty philosophy and have regular contacts with the platform generally treat researchers more fairly.YesWeHack introduces companies to the philosophy of bug bounty hunting and they point out the importance of working with the researcher and so on, and this builds trust and long-term relationships. This environment and the variety of available scopes are part of the many reasons I enjoy working on this platform.They are also very supportive of researchers and help companies specify safe harbor policies.It’s an important point because here in Switzerland the law is very narrow in regards to [good faith] hacking. I’ve never had any legal issues but in in theory it’s important.RELATED Intigriti launches EU-backed bug bounty program for Matrix secure communications toolTo what extent do you think the European bug bounty industry is catching up with its more established US counterpart?I think the European bug bounty industry is catching up with the US.For example, YesWeHack, which has done a great job introducing crowdsourced security to European companies, has been actively expanding outside of Europe, notably with programs coming from Asia. They have more than doubled their number of program launches this year, so I would say the industry is in full swing.In Switzerland, where bug bounty hunting was not well established until recently, I also see more and more programs springing up.The European bug bounty market has become more established over recent yearsWhat advice would you give to someone who wants to become a bug hunter or has recently started bug hunting?Train the basics about networking, development, frameworks, OS, cryptography, authentication, and network protocols to gain a deeper understanding of each scope.Then train to exploit each category of vulnerability. Many labs are available online, such as PortSwigger’s excellent Web Security Academy. If you're bored by training, do some bug bounty for a while, until you feel like you need to get back to training.Read a lot of security articles – vulnerability disclosures, PoCs – and save them whenever you feel they are interesting. It is important to understand the core of each vulnerability, so that you may adapt your PoC if, for example, a WAF prevents you from exploiting the vulnerability.RELATED ‘I thought it was a complete fluke’ – Katie Paxton-Fear on her bug bounty baptism and why AI will never fully replace security researchersEveryone is different, but I would recommend not to write down notes – except report templates or select cheat sheets – because you need to train your memory at recognizing familiar frameworks, applications, and environments, and know where you can find the information you need.Your goal is to speed up your analysis of the scopes so that you can focus on areas worth investigating.Analyze source code whenever available. Do not hesitate to deploy elements of the scope on your own machine, if available, to get a better understanding of attack vectors. Spend some time on the reconnaissance.Try not to report vulnerabilities you find ASAP, but attempt to increase criticality by combining them with [other bugs]. Spending time to bypass a WAF is often worthwhile.And finally, don’t give up – bug bounty hunting takes practice, and it is hard at first not to have duplicates.The hard thing with bug bounty is knowing how to organize your week because there are constantly new things to test and it’s pretty stressful, so it’s also important sometimes to take a break, do some sports, things like that.Do you expect to continue doing bug hunting for a long time? Any plans to do anything else?I love my job, so I plan to do this for quite some time. At the moment I have no plan of doing anything else.READ MORE Collaborative bug hunting ‘could be very lucrative’ – security pro Alex Chapman on the future of ethical hacking",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/train-the-basics-bug-bounty-hunter-xel-on-forging-a-lucrative-career-in-ethical-hacking,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Interviews', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'RCE', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Organizations', 'Industry', 'News', 'Europe', 'Switzerland', 'France', 'Research', 'Zero-day', 'Network', 'Security', 'Encryption', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Education']"
no,Details of YouTube viewing history exposure bug made public,Embedded risk,"Opening a website with an embedded YouTube video potentially allowed miscreants to access a user’s viewing history, favorites, and playlists.The security bug – which earned a modest $1,337 bounty from Google – was uncovered by security researcher David Schutz, who went public with his findings earlier this week through a detailed technical blog post.Schutz explained that he uncovered the vulnerability by connecting two things together in a somewhat “unexpected” way.Read more of the latest security vulnerability newsYouTube (YT) has an embedded player that allows website developers to embed videos into their own site. This player also has an API, which enables users to control and obtain information about the player.This allows a user to, for example, play/pause the player, load a new video/playlist, and list the contents of the currently playing playlist.“This is of course, working as intended,” Schutz told The Daily Swig. “On YT everyone also has a few special private playlists, like (at the time) the playlist with the ID ‘HL’ contained the user’s watch history, the ‘WL’ the user’s watch later, and so on.”There was also a special uploads playlist which, “when viewed by the channel owner, listed all uploaded videos, including unlisted ones”.Stolen historySchutz explained the flaw: “Since the YT embedded player is also logged in to YT, a malicious website could have embedded a player, instructed it to play e.g. the ‘HL’ playlist (which would start playing the currently visiting user's watch history), and get the contents of the playlists using the API the embedded player has, thereby stealing the watch history of the user who opened the website.”He continued: “The attacker could also have prepared a page for a specific victim, which when opened by that victim, would steal the victim’s unlisted videos (which otherwise would require knowing the ID to watch).”Schutz’s blog post goes on to list other ways to exploit the bug.“The main issue was that you were able to load private playlists into the player in the name of the victim, and later steal the contents of those private playlists,” he concludes.The Daily Swig asked Google to comment on Schutz’s findings but we’re yet to hear back.Schutz has previously disclosed two other YouTube security flaws, including one enabling the theft of any private YouTube video if you knew its ID.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/details-of-youtube-viewing-history-exposure-bug-made-public,"['Privacy', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'YouTube', 'Google', 'Research', 'API', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Industry', 'News']"
no,"Magecart attacks in 2021: Cat-and-mouse game continues between cybercrooks, researchers, law enforcement","Under-resourced webstores urgently need our help, say security researchers","The discovery of Magecart card skimming infrastructure lurking behind a ‘bulletproof’ hosting service is just the latest example of how the notorious e-commerce heisters mask their activities.RiskIQ research published last week revealed that Magecart groups, which plant JavaScript skimmers on website checkout pages to hoover up payment form data, were hiding thousands of malicious domains on ‘cybercrime-friendly’ hosting service Media Land.Obfuscation techniquesMagecart skimmers, which can gain a foothold on websites via malicious or compromised third-party JavaScript libraries, use obfuscation to keep infections undetected for long periods.BACKGROUND Magecart: How a single skimming case evolved into widespread credit card theftJacob Pimental, incident response analyst at T Rowe Price, observed a marked shift in obfuscation techniques used during 2020 alone, as attackers capitalized on the online shopping surge precipitated by Covid-19.ObfuscatorIO, a free, open source JavaScript obfuscator, was preeminent initially, but “recent trends have been hiding code in images or legitimate CSS files,” he tells The Daily Swig.Shape-shifting skimmers can evade detection with modest, unoriginal adaptations, according to malware analyst Max Kersten.Magecart attackers exploit vulnerabilities in e-commerce website backend systems“Techniques change over time, but change does not always mean that a technique is new,” he tells The Daily Swig, citing scripts obfuscated with radix loaders, notably deployed by highly active newcomers Magecart 12.“We learn from the past, as we do in all fields, but small alterations from the attackers (and the pressure that security software should not alert false positives) make it hard to continually keep up,” says Kersten.“The major players in this business are able to do that, but small shops generally do not have such a license.”Mom and popular targetsAttackers do occasionally claim high-profile victims, such as Macy’s, British Airways, and several unidentified, high traffic domains infected via a ‘spray and pray’ attack dissected by RiskIQ in 2019.However, both Pimental’s and Kersten’s Magecart research demonstrates that small ‘mom and pop’ web shops are much easier to compromise.“Many small shops are installed by an IT professional as a one-time job, after which the shop owner takes over,” says Kersten. “The shop owner might not know credit card skimmers exist, nor be aware of best practices in IT security in general.”RELATED Magecart gang bypasses iframe protection on hosted payment site?Many consequently fail to apply software updates – more than 200,000 web shops had failed to upgrade from Magento 1 a week after it reached end of life in June 2020, for instance.Pimental believes Magecart researchers should improve communication channels with “shop owners, as most of them won't respond when I or other researchers reach out to them.”The “helpful spirit” encountered in the security community by Kersten bodes well for the prospect of achieving such goals: “During my research I met a lot of great people who offered their help and service without expecting any payment,” he says.Reasons for optimismAlthough “2020 saw Magecart actors engaged in continual innovation to hide both their skimming code and their exfiltration channels and continued successful attacks on a large scale”, RiskIQ threat researcher Jordan Herman believes “there is reason to feel optimistic as we kick-off 2021”.“A substantial increase in awareness generally and focused analysis and reporting from security researchers” is exposing “new techniques as they are implemented, uncovers new skimmer domains and infrastructure, and connects the dots between them to correlate the gathered data and attribute it to a criminal group,” Herman tells The Daily Swig.Undertaken over several years, this painstaking work bore fruit in the arrest in January 2020 of three suspects linked to a large-scale Magecart campaign.While Pimental expects Magecart attacks will continue to become more sophisticated and “harder to spot”, Herman anticipates that 2021 will “see more pressure on these groups from various law enforcement agencies and disruption to their activities, as well as a continued commitment from a varied group of security professionals to tracking and exposing the ongoing criminal activity”.RECOMMENDED Introducing Malvuln.com – the first website ‘exclusively dedicated’ to revealing security vulnerabilities in malware",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/magecart-attacks-in-2021-cat-and-mouse-game-continues-between-cybercrooks-researchers-law-enforcement,"['Magecart', 'Cybercrime', 'Fraud', 'Finance', 'E-Commerce', 'Retail', 'Browsers', 'JavaScript', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Research', 'Coronavirus']"

Vulnerability in popular music app could leak your location data with a single malicious URL,Application patched against privacy-slurping bug,"A vulnerability in music-recognition app Shazam could allow an attacker to steal a user’s precise location data using a single malicious URL.UK security researcher Ash King discovered the bug in the popular application, which is available for both Android and iOS users, back in December 2018, but finally disclosed his findings on Sunday (January 17).How deep is your link?The Shazam app can identify the names of music tracks, movies, and TV shows based on listening to a short segment of audio via the device’s microphone.It uses deeplinks throughout the app as part of its navigation, King explained. The privacy flaw arose because one exported deeplink which loaded websites in a WebView (app-embedded browser) was not validating its parameter, potentially giving attackers control of external resources.Read more of the latest mobile security newsAn attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by sending a malicious URL that opens in Shazam when the user clicks the link.Shazam then opens a WebView and executes the payload, which sends the location data back to the attacker.King has provided a more detailed explanation of how the exploit works on his blog.Bum noteAt the time, the vulnerability affected more than 100 million users, he said. It was eventually fixed in March 2019.King reported the issue three months after Apple acquired the Shazam app. He explained, however, that Apple did not deem the vulnerability eligible under its bug bounty program.“I came across an article back in 2017 where someone found a Heartbleed vulnerability on a few Shazam servers,” King told The Daily Swig.“He reported it and was awarded a bounty within two weeks. The payout was a key selling point for me to spend time looking at this app.“This app was also in scope for Google Play Security Rewards Program so finding a mobile issue would have resulted in a double bounty, or so I thought.”King said that Google did not deem location data as “a big enough security risk”, but warned that the privacy-conscious could be at risk if they do not update their Shazam app.He said: “If a user has enabled the location permission for Shazam, their precise location could be stolen at any time.“Whilst some companies don’t see your location data as a privacy issue, users who rely on being anonymous are the ones most at risk.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Security researchers earn $50k after exposing critical flaw in Apple travel portal",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/shazam-vulnerability-in-popular-music-app-could-leak-your-location-data-with-a-single-malicious-url,"['Bug', 'Bounty', 'Mobile', 'Apple', 'Google', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Privacy', 'UK']"
no,Incoming Biden administration looks to shake up US cybersecurity policy,‘I would like to see a pivot from cyber warfare back to risk mitigation and personal privacy’,"ANALYSIS Cybersecurity issues – not least allegations that Russian interference brought him to power – loomed large over the presidency of Donald Trump.With cyber-attacks against the US public and private sector at an all-time high, as evidenced by the recent SolarWinds supply chain hack, the incoming Biden administration has a huge amount of work to do in the cybersecurity arena.Cyberwar – what is it good for?Experts polled by The Daily Swig agreed that the Trump administration ushered in a much more aggressive approach to cyber offense compared to previous US governments. There was, however, disagreement on whether this policy should be changed after Joe Biden is sworn into office tomorrow (January 20).Over the past four years, the US carried out cyber operations to shut down Russian troll farms and Iranian military targets.BACKGROUND Global governments issue alert after FireEye hack is linked to SolarWinds supply chain attack“That shouldn’t change under the Biden administration,” Jay Kaplan, CEO of crowdsourced security firm Synack, told The Daily Swig. “The SolarWinds hack is a clear sign that we must be more aggressive when it comes to hitting back against adversaries who attack us in cyberspace.”“We can’t just sit back and accept breaches, hacks, and digital extortion,” he added.Chris Morales, head of security analytics at Vectra, an AI-based attack detection technology vendor, disagreed with Kaplan and argued that the Trump administration’s belligerent approach was rooted in outdated Cold War thinking and was ill-suited to combating contemporary cyber threats.Joe Biden will be sworn in as US President on January 20, 2021“For enterprise, the goal has always been to ‘mitigate risk’,” Morales explained. “That was the posture of the federal cybersecurity strategy prior to the Trump administration, last defined in 2015.”“In 2018, the new posture was ‘assertively defend our interests’ which is more active and risk accepting. The strategy used terms like ‘win’ and ‘pre-empt’, which is a lot like the same language used during the Cold War,” he continued.Read more of the latest security policy and legislation newsThese enhanced military cyber capabilities were enacted through policy initiatives including unified cyber command, legislation clarifying DoD (US Department of Defense) authority to wage cyber war, “defend forward” cyber strategy, and offensive cyber operations.“I would like to see a pivot from cyber warfare back to risk mitigation and personal privacy,” Morales concluded.“While going on the offensive sounds like a deterrent, it is not aligned with how cyber-attacks truly occur, as witnessed in the latest SolarWinds breach.”Restorative measuresThe incoming Biden administration plans to elevate the importance of many cyber issues.Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy, commented: “President Biden will restore two White House posts to prominence that were all but ignored during President Trump’s time in office, which are Homeland Security adviser and cybersecurity advisors.”Hauk added: “Biden is also likely to confront Russia over its cyber-attacks, such as its alleged attempts to disrupt elections in the West.” Synack’s Kaplan said: “Unlike Trump, the Biden administration will work with our allies to form alliances to improve cybersecurity and develop international standards to establish global norms of behavior in cyberspace.”Bridging the digital divideBoth the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration are trying to bridge the digital divide between rural and urban Americans by making high-speed broadband more widely available.Speaking during a session at the CES trade show, Brian Deese, director designate at the National Economic Council, described broadband rollout at “essential” to the Biden administration’s post-Covid “Build Back Better” agenda, adding that partnership with the private sector will be key.RELATED CES 2021: Cybersecurity talent pool must expand to take advantage of quantum computingEarly on in Trump's presidency, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) infamously repealed two major internet regulations: broadband privacy and net neutrality.“I expect Biden to restore those consumer protections during his term,” commented Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech, a consumer-focused security and technology comparison service.Net neutrality ensures that internet service providers treat all types and sources of internet traffic equally, essentially classifying the internet as a utility. Broadband privacy rules ensure that internet service providers could not collect and sell customer browsing histories, communications, location data, and other private information without consent.End-to-end encryptionBack in the security sphere, the Trump administration previously attacked end-to-end encryption amid claims that the technology can subvert national security.Comparitech’s Bischoff commented: “I’m not sure where Biden will come down on this, but during his time as Vice President under Obama, the administration engaged in no small amount of cyber-spying and bulk data collection, as revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013.RELATED Western governments double down efforts to curtail end-to-end encryption“His past policies would indicate that Biden wouldn’t be opposed to banning end-to-end encryption, but pressure from other lawmakers and his constituents might persuade him otherwise,” he added.John Petrie, counsellor to the chief information security officer (CISO) at IT giant NTT, looked forward to a greater degree of post-Trump cyber policy continuity than many might imagine.“The cybersecurity structure within the Trump administration, although with a reduced White House presence, has actually been mostly bipartisan and politics has been generally set aside,” Petrie explained.“The dismissal of Chris Krebs is where this happy situation began to deteriorate a bit. But when we talk about the initiatives, I don’t think we’ll see a lot of change.”For example, the emphasis of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) becoming a cybersecurity hub will remain.“In terms of funding, I don’t expect there to be budget cuts,” Petrie said. “In fact, NSA funding may even increase.”A more liberal Biden regime may well usher in more regulation.“From a regulatory perspective, most of the Trump administration has been focused on deregulation across the board,” Petrie said. “The Biden administration is expected to increase regulatory requirements.”Petrie continued: “In the cybersecurity world, that means more scrutiny in terms of limitations and reporting for both private and public sectors.”Will the incoming Biden-Harris administration signal a change of direction for US cybersecurity policy?Embracing open sourceIn related news, the Biden-Harris administration has appointed David Recordon as the White House director of technology.Vectra’s Morales praised the move, saying: “Recordon is best known for his contribution to open standard authentication protocols and methods, which is precisely the type of technology the industry and federal government needs.“He has a proven track record as a technologist and will most likely continue his previous efforts around modernisation of the federal government.”Derek Weeks, vice president and DevOps Advocate at Sonatype, added: “In appointing David Recordon as the White House director of technology, the Biden-Harris administration rightly recognises how integral open source software and application security are to the modern enterprise.”Sam Curry, chief security officer at Cybereason, an attack detection and response company, told The Daily Swig that which, if any, of Trump administration’s initiatives will be preserved will remain unclear until the Biden administration settles into power.“Until we hear from President-elect Biden himself on the new policies which will be determined for the most part in the first 100 days, it's hard to say,” Curry commented.“President-elect Biden has to complete the transition of power for the executive branch, which involves a lot of people and processes to go right.”“There’s no guarantee that there won’t be landmines and scorched earth from the Trump administration making that difficult,” he added.American Rescue PlanThe Biden-Harris administration's American Rescue Plan of early economic policies pledges to modernize federal IT systems to defend against cyber-attacks, such as the recently discovered SolarWinds assault.The administration wants Congress to allocate $9 billion to expand and improve the Technology Modernization Fund, authorize a separate program for hiring, and allocate an addition $690m to improve security monitoring and incident response.Independent experts warned that the administration should be careful to avoid falling into the trap of defending against the last big threat.Sean Sullivan, a security advisor at F-Secure and political science graduate, told The Daily Swig: ""I hope the Biden administration doesn’t fall into the all-too-common trap of defending against the last known threat.""Sullivan explained that a great deal of effort and resources was focused on defending the 2020 US election, which was ""definitely important, but I can’t help but think that it took away from other areas"".""And now, because of the SolarWinds snafu, too much over correction will kick in and the system will focus on supply chains to the exclusion of many other threats,"" Sullivan said.""It feels similar to when Sony’s PlayStation Network was hacked in 2011. Sony companies then focused on protecting customer data. But then in 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment learned (the hard way) that its own data was also important to secure. We’re probably due another Sony hack of some kind."" This story was updated to add information about the Biden-Harris administration's American Rescue Plan and comment from F-Secure's Sean SullivanREAD MORE National security concerns raised as Trump loyalists storm US Capitol",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/incoming-biden-administration-looks-to-shake-up-us-cybersecurity-policy,"['Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'US', 'Government', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Russia', 'Analysis', 'Enterprise', 'Organizations', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'North', 'America', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Coronavirus', 'Telecommunications', 'Critical', 'Infrastructure', 'Privacy', 'Hardware', 'Encryption', 'Legal', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps']"
no,Mind the (skills) gap: Cybersecurity talent pool must expand to take advantage of quantum computing opportunities,Experts at the CES 2021 conference stress importance of security education,"The “second age” of quantum computing is poised to bring a wealth of new opportunities to the cybersecurity industry – but in order to take full advantage of these benefits, the skills gap must be closed.This was the takeaway of a discussion between two cybersecurity experts at the CES 2021 virtual conference last week.Pete Totrorici, director of Joint Information Warfare at the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center, joined Vikram Sharma, CEO of QuintessenceLabs, during a talk titled ‘AI and quantum cyber disruption’.New ageQuantum computing is in its second age, according to Sharma, meaning that the cybersecurity industry will soon start to witness the improvements in encryption, AI, and other areas that have long been promised by the technology.BACKGROUND Quantum leap forward in cryptography could make niche technology mainstream“Quantum-era cybersecurity will wield the power to detect and deflect quantum-era cyber-attacks before they cause harm,” a report from IBM reads.“It is the technology of our time, indeed,” commented Sharma, who is based in Canberra, Australia.QuintessenceLabs is “looking at the application of advanced quantum technologies” within the cybersecurity sphere, says Sharma, in particular the realm of data protection.Governments and large organizations have also invested in the quantum space in recent years, with the US, UK, and India all providing funding for research.Exploring AIThe Joint AI Center was founded in 2018 and was launched “to transform the Department of Defense to the adoption of artificial intelligence”, said Totrorici.A subdivision of the US Armed Forces, the center is responsible for exploring the use of AI and AI-enhanced communication for use in real-world combat situations.“Specifically, we’re trying to identify how we employ AI solutions that will have a mission impact,” he said.“Across the department our day-to-day composes everything from development strategy, policy, product development, industry engagement, and other outreach activities, but if I need to identify something that I think is my most significant challenge today, it’s understanding the department’s varied needs.”As with last year, CES took place virtually in 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemicIn order to reach these needs, Totrorici said that relationships between the center, academia, industry, and government need to be established.“There was a time when the DoD go it alone, [however] those days are long gone.“If we’re going to solve problems like AI employment or quantum development, [it] is going to require partnerships,” he said.Mind the (skills) gapTotrorici and Sharma both agreed that while the future is certainly in quantum computing, the ever-widening cyber skills gap needs to be addressed to take advantage of its potential.Indeed, these partnerships cannot be formed if there aren’t enough experts in the field.Totrorici said: “Forefront in the mind of the DoD nowadays is, ‘How do we how do we cultivate and retain talent?’“I still think the United States does a great job of growing and building talent. Now the question becomes, ‘Will we retain that talent, how do we leverage that time going forward, and where are we building it?’”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Quantum encryption – the devil is in the implementationThe (ISC)2 2020 Workforce Study (PDF) found that the current cybersecurity industry needs to grow by 89% in order to effectively protect against cyber threats.Of the companies surveyed, the study also revealed that 64% current have some shortage of dedicated cybersecurity staff.“Here in Australia we’ve recently established what’s called the Sydney Quantum Academy, and that is an overarching group that sits across four leadings institutions that are doing some cutting-edge work in quantum in the country,” said Sharma.“One of the aims of that academy is to produce quantum skilled folks broadly, but also looking specifically in the quantum cybersecurity area.“So certainly, some small initiatives that [have] kicked off, but I think there’s a big gap there that that will need to be filled as we move forward.”READ MORE Infosec pro Vandana Verma on improving diversity and helping to grow the Indian security community",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/mind-the-skills-gap-cybersecurity-talent-pool-must-expand-to-take-advantage-of-quantum-computing-opportunities,"['Cyber-attacks', 'Education', 'Australia', 'US', 'Government', 'Organizations', 'Encryption', 'Events', 'Oceania', 'Industry', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Research']"
no,VoIP vulnerability: CoTURN patches access control protection bypass,Affected organizations also urged to implement protective configurations,"Attackers can bypass CoTURN servers’ default access control rules and access network services behind the firewall, security researchers have discovered.One researcher speculated that, under certain circumstances, an attacker could go on to achieve remote code execution (RCE) (although he emphasized that the documented vulnerability was not itself an RCE flaw).Berlin-based Enable Security has urged organizations that use the open source servers, which power VoIP platforms, to apply their configuration advice as well as the latest software update.CoTURN “is used in almost all WebRTC and VoIP systems” worldwide, because it is fast, effective, and “the most full-featured STUN/TURN implementation AFAIK”, Mihály Mészáros, the project’s maintainer, told The Daily Swig.Akin to a proxy server, a TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) server permits the relaying of TCP connections and UDP packets to other peers.Bypassing the blockThe specter of attackers abusing TURN servers to connect to local services prompted CoTURN maintainers to, in 2018, block by default connections to loopback IP addresses 127.0.0.1 on IPv4 and [::1] on IPv6.However, security researchers bypassed the IPv4 block (as demonstrated in the video below) after discovering that “the same effect could be achieved by specifying 0.0.0.0 as IP instead of 127.0.0.1” – on Linux systems and “possibly other operating systems” too, a technical blog post explains.The IPv6 block turned out to be flawed too. “Strangely we could still specify [::1] as peer address and get connected to local services without getting the standard 403, Forbidden IP response,” reads the blog post. There was also “no code to protect against [::]”.Worst-case scenarioThe havoc a successful attacker could wreak “greatly depends on what is on the loopback interface”, Sandro Gauci, CEO and founder of Enable Security, told The Daily Swig.“A worst-case scenario would be a network service that does not require authentication (because the loopback interface is often considered to be a trusted network) and allows remote code execution.”RELATED Open TURN proxy granted unauthorized access to Slack’s infrastructureHe added: “If you have the tools, it is not difficult at all to exploit this vulnerability.”“Fortunately, when researchers probed applicable bug bounty programs only one environment permitted “connections to localhost and only on UDP”.This suggests, the researchers believe, that many organizations have implemented recommendations accompanying Enable Security’s June 2020 research documenting the vulnerability’s presence at several WebRTC-based service providers, and their April 2020 disclosure of a configuration flaw in Slack’s TURN servers.Remediation, mitigation, configurationCoTURN maintainers were alerted to the bypass on November 20. The flaw (CVE-2020-26262) affected CoTURN version 4.5.1.3 and was addressed in version 4.5.2, which landed on January 11.Enable Security provided the fixes, which blocked 0.0.0.0/8 and [::] by default and correctly parsed the IPv6 loopback address [::1], at the request of CoTURN’s Mészáros.In addition to applying the update, the researchers recommend using “denied-peer-ip to block special purpose addresses”, or even deploying “TURN servers on an isolated environment” with “no special access to internal systems”.Organizations unable to immediately apply the latest update are advised in the meantime to “set the -L flag or listening-ip configuration with the value of an IPv4 address” (albeit this will prevent relaying of IPv6 traffic too).CoTURN clarion callSandro Gauci said Mészáros Mihály had been “very receptive and helpful”, while Mihály expressed gratitude for Enable Security’s professionalism and patch proposals, and othersecurity teams’ help with the fix rollout and various other issues.Mészáros, who said he didn’t have time to fix the problems himself, implored organizations that depend on CoTURN to get in touch via GitHub and help him and project author Oleg Moskalenko maintain the project.READ MORE CoTURN patches denial-of-service and memory corruption flaws",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/voip-vulnerability-coturn-patches-access-control-protection-bypass,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Network', 'Security', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Research', 'RCE', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'Encryption', 'Authentication', 'GitHub', 'Organizations']"
no,"Security pro seizes expired DR Congo top-level domain, takes over 50% of DNS traffic",The researcher purchased the domain to stop it from falling into the wrong hands,"It’s rare for the top-level domains of countries to fall into the hands of individuals, but in some cases it is the only way to stop cybercriminals from exploiting expired domains.On January 15, Fredrik Almroth, founder and head of engineering at Detectify, described how a general scan on nameserver records used by top-level domains (TLDs) worldwide resulted in the discovery of a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) in immediate danger of becoming vulnerable to attack.Almroth’s scan, performed in December 2020, showed that ‘scpt-network.com’ linked to the nameservers managing the ccTLD used by the Democratic Republic of Congo (.cd) – home to approximately 87 million people – was displaying the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) status code ‘redemptionPeriod’.In a technical blog post, the security researcher described how this was concerning, prompting him to monitor the domain. A week later, he received an alert that the domain was ‘pendingDelete’ – a status usually reserved for when an owner forgets to, or elects not to, renew their domain name.Disaster avertedThe moment the domain expired, threat actors could snap it up and, therefore, would also seize the nameserver capabilities of .cd.Now able to intercept traffic running through the ccTLD, attackers could perform DNS hijacking, surveillance, Manipulator-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, and data theft.Apex .cd domains, too, would be at risk, as attackers controlling the TLD could potentially take them over, perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or infiltrate local networks.Read more of the latest internet infrastructure security news“As an end-user, you would not be able to trust any content seen on any .cd website,” Almroth told The Daily Swig.“If used maliciously a threat actor could leverage the position to issue new SSL/TLS certificates for most websites at will. The same goes for file downloads and the like which could be manipulated while in transit.”To prevent this and to keep the domain “from falling into the wrong hands”, Almroth purchased the domain on December 30. As a result, temporarily, the researcher obtained control of approximately 50% of all DNS traffic for the top-level domain.Returned to rightful ownerOn January 7, the researcher reached out to contacts listed for the .cd domain with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in order to transfer ownership.While no follow-up confirmation was received, the issue was tackled within 14 hours and both nameserver delegations and traffic has now been redirected.Almroth still owns the domain name for scpt-network.com. The incident was also reported to HackerOne’s Internet Bug Bounty on January 8, but as of the time of the writing, the researcher has not been in further contact with the team.Almroth told us that he did uncover interesting data regarding the DNS queries, but this will “require further analysis before doing a statement of any additional findings”.A spokesperson for ICANN told us that the agency has “a very limited role” in regard to ccTLDs as they “operate within their respective countries and [are] accountable to their local communities”.RECOMMENDED NSA advises national security supply chain on replacing deprecated encryption protocols",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/security-pro-seizes-expired-dr-congo-top-level-domain-takes-over-50-of-dns-traffic,"['Internet', 'Infrastructure', 'Africa', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'DDoS', 'MitM', 'Cyber-attacks', 'DNS', 'Network', 'Security', 'Encryption', 'Hacking', 'News']"
no,Security researchers earn $50k after exposing critical flaw in Apple travel portal,Chained exploit leads to shell access,"Security researchers have earned a $50,000 bug bounty after uncovering a critical flaw in Apple’s travel portal.Rahul Maini and Harsh Jaiswal were able to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by stringing together a string of vulnerabilities in order to exploit targeted domains.The bug hunting exercise was inspired by earlier work by Sam Curry and his associates that uncovered no fewer than 55 vulnerabilities in Apple’s web infrastructure, earning a cumulative bug bounty of $288,000.Curry is continuing his work and this week went public with vulnerabilities in Apple’s domain that created a means to get billing data from any Apple user.Lucee in the sky with exploitsIn a detailed technical write-up, Maini and Jaiswal explain how the early stage of their bug hunt narrowed their range of targets down to three hosts running on a content management system (CMS) which was back-ended by Lucee, a Java-based tag and scripting language used for web app development.“We opted to focus on Lucee as it exposed an admin panel and had [a] history of vulnerabilities,” the researchers explain.READ MORE Introducing Malvuln.com – the first website dedicated to revealing vulnerabilities in malwareLucee’s admin panel was accessible on three different hosts on Apple, two of which were running an outdated version of the software.Further investigation by the researchers uncovered Lucee misconfiguration issues that would have allowed an attacker to access authenticated ColdFusion (CFM) files directly, clearing the way for a skilled hacker to carry out admin actions without being authenticated.WAF bypassInitial attempts to exploit this find were blocked by Apple’s web application firewall (WAF).But via imgProces.cfm and admin.search.index.cfm functions the researchers were able to overcome this obstacle and achieve RCE on the facilities.apple.com domain.This attack worked without tripping up the WAF because it could be carried out without attempting a path traversal or other blocked action.The problematic imgProcess.cfm function was not available on the outdated versions of Lucee present on two travel-related Apple domains.Read more of the latest hacking newsThe researchers overcame this hurdle by putting together an exploit based on .lex extensions, which had useful properties in the context of Lucee server exploitation.“A .lex file is actually nothing but an archive or a zip file with [the] '.lex' extension which is actually a format of Lucee’s extensions which we could upload,” the researchers explained. “Also, there’s no check on the contents, so we can set it to anything.”“From playing around [with] Lucee, we knew that it allows using protocol/schemes like zip://, file:// etc. (which we utilized in this exploit chain) so we could specify these schemes wherever a FileSystem function had our fully controlled input (luceeArchiveZipPath in this case).”Poppin’ shellsBy chaining together these various issues it was possible to upload exploit code onto the vulnerable systems and achieve shell access.The researchers conclude: “Apple promptly fixed the issue but requested us to not disclose the issue before they make some other changes.”The developers behind Lucee have also acted to address vulnerabilities in their technology.“[The] Lucee team has also fixed the bug by restricting access to CFM files directly,” the researchers add.The Daily Swig approached Maini and Jaiswal for comment on their Apple bug hunting project.

no,French cybersecurity non-profit Luatix strengthens its open source development capabilities with ANSSI partnership,Freshly inked partnership follows the development of two open source security tools,"The French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) has formally joined Luatix, a non-profit aimed at helping organizations improve their cybersecurity defenses, after helping develop the group’s threat intelligence and crisis management platforms.Created last year, Luatix is focused on conducting research and development in the fields of information security and crisis management.ANSSI’s official membership will see the agency become more heavily involved in product roadmaps and governance; project management and coordination with external entities; features and third-party tooling development; and community animation, according to a press release published by Luatix.Luatix has described ANSSI as a founding member, having been the first organization, along with CERT-EU (the Computer Emergency Response Team for EU Institutions), to be involved in Luatix’s inaugural security projects, OpenCTI and OpenEx.OpenCTI, designed for integrating, storing, organizing, visualizing, and sharing cyber threat intelligence, was initially developed internally at ANSSI to help store and structure the agency’s knowledge on cyber threats.Last spring, it was open-sourced to the wider cybersecurity community.OpenCTI is a free-to-use security and threat intelligence platformMeanwhile, Luatix’s other service, OpenEx, automates the process of planning and carrying out crisis management exercises, with a range of different scenarios, audiences, simulations, and encryption.The platform supports collaborative work, real-time monitoring, statistics, and the management of feedback.Gap in the marketGerome Billois, global cybersecurity partner at French security consultancy Wavestone, says OpenEx fills an important gap in the market.“I think it’s a very good initiative,” he tells The Daily Swig. “Right now, if you look at the cybersecurity tools that we have, there are plenty of tools to protect and secure information systems, but we are still in the process of building efficient tools to respond to and to allay the threat.”RELATED France tops blue-chip cybersecurity maturity indexBillois added: “Right now, cybersecurity drills are often carried out manually. But you reach a limit at some point, and now these large companies are having to train on managing very large cybersecurity incidents… I think it is a very good idea to test them with this tool, which is open source.”Open source developmentsLuatix will continue to develop the tools, with a new version of OpenCTI launched last month.The data schema has been redesigned for more clarity and to align it as closely as possible with the STIX 2.1 standard, while the performance and scalability of the ingestion process have been improved.Real-time synchronization of several OpenCTI platforms and live feeds is now included, and the technology stack has been simplified.

no,Critical zero-day RCE in Microsoft Office 365 awaits third security patch,‘Not all code execution bugs in .net are deserialization related’,"UPDATED A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Online remains unresolved after security researchers bypassed two patches for successive exploits.Rated as critical, the zero-day flaw impacts multiple Software as a Service (SaaS) providers as well as on-premise installations of Exchange Server.The bug in Exchange Online, part of the Office 365 suite, could be exploited to gain “access to millions of corporate email accounts”, said Steven Seeley of the Qihoo 360 Vulcan Team in a blog post published yesterday (January 12).Office 365’s user base is burgeoning along with demand for cloud deployments more generally, reaching 200 million active users by the end of 2019.Read more of the latest Microsoft security newsSeeley said he was motivated to probe the environment for RCEs given that six other such bugs in Microsoft Exchange Server had emerged in the last two years, most notably CVE-2020-0688 and CVE-2019-1373, the latter prompting him to “focus on the powershell remoting interface”.That the vulnerabilities were all authenticated did not diminish the severity “since a malicious tenant can be created with ease and the necessary permissions applied” – a “fundamental” yet often “overlooked” difference between targeting cloud-based versus on-premise environments, said Seeley.Improper validationMicrosoft assigned the initial flaw (CVE-2020-16875) as a high-risk classification (CVSS 8.4), though marked it as having a low attack complexity.As per the security advisory, the vulnerability was found within the New-DlpPolicy cmdlet and arose from improper “validation of user-supplied template data when creating a dlp policy”.Seeley triggered the flaw via both the ecp and powershell interface.To his surprise, targeting outlook.office365.com and outlook.office.com servers proved that he could “execute commands as SYSTEM on Microsoft’s cloud and exfiltrate sensitive data over http without being caught”.He added: “Using your own zero-day found in Microsoft’s own code to attack their cloud servers is quite satisfying!”Triple smart bypassThere were two ways to bypass Microsoft’s first patch, resulting in CVE-2020-171324 with a CVSS of 9.1.Seeley, a 2020 Master of Pwn, bypassed the fix, which addressed the bug in DlpPolicyTemplateMetaData.ValidateCmdletParameters, with powershell call operators, using the ‘&’ symbol to call powershell cmdlets.Another team of researchers – Leonard Rapp, Markus Vervier, and Yasar Klawohn – independently discovered that the patch failed to block execution of inline code in the powershell console.“After looping through the cmdlet list”, Seeley then bypassed the second patch with call operators that circumvented a RestrictedLanguage mode runspace and fulfilled six checks performed by a call to CmdletValidator.ValidateCmdlet that were designed to thwart an attack.Bumper payoutMicrosoft rewarded Seeley “handsomely” for his findings under their Online Services Bounty Program, which pays up to $20,000 for critical RCE flaws.The researcher sent his initial report to Microsoft on May 22, and a security advisory was released on September 8.The final bypass was reported on December 9, one day after Microsoft’s monthly Patch Tuesday. With a final patch yet to (hopefully) land, there remains “no mitigation against this attack”, warned Seeley.A spokesperson for Microsoft told The Daily Swig: “We are aware of the report and will take necessary steps to keep our customers safe.”They also suggested that the risk is somewhat mitigated because “the technique described requires an attacker to have already compromised a target machine and have permission to run malicious code”.However, Markus Vervier, who found one of the bypasses for the first patch, told The Daily Swig, that this was not accurate.“The vulnerability can be exploited by accounts having Data Loss Prevention (DLP) rights. This does NOT mean an an attacker is able to run malicious code on the system and we cannot confirm the statement made by Microsoft.“The vulnerability allows privilege escalation to SYSTEM on the on-prem versions of Exchange. Additionally, the vulnerability allowed a compromise of Exchange Online from a testing organization. X41 could confirm within the limits of the bug bounty program that access to infrastructure and data was possible.”Microsoft later responded: “The technique described has already been mitigated in Exchange Online. For the on premise version of Exchange Server, the attacker would need administrative permissions to leverage the vulnerability.”‘Single point of failure’“Is relying on a cloud providers with a single point of failure system the right approach?” asked the researcher.With relatively new technologies “it’s always wise to re-evaluate the threat landscape”, he added. Attackers may “have more access than you initially thought”.Addressing security researchers, Seeley said: “Not all code execution bugs in .net are deserialization related. It’s easy to fall into the tunnel vision trap so it’s important to remember not to ‘follow the crowd’.”This article was updated on January 14 with comments from Microsoft.

no,Browser security briefing: Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a ‘post-XSS world’,The Firefox and Chrome development teams share their progress in minimizing the impact of classic web attacks,"ANALYSIS New browser security features offer the tantalizing promise of killing – or at least significantly reducing – many of the classic web security attack vectors.Minimizing the potency of classic attack vectors such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) promises to herald what some are calling the ‘post-XSS world’.The improvements represented a culmination of several years of work by many people in the industry, realized in specifications and implementations in Google Chrome 83 and Mozilla Firefox 79.Security improvement rosterA blog post by Google back in July describes a set of security mechanisms to protect its applications from common web vulnerabilities.These mechanisms include Trusted Types, Content Security Policy based on script nonces, Fetch Metadata Request Headers, and the Cross-Origin Opener Policy that collectively protect applications.These features offer protection against injection attacks, alongside improved isolation capabilities.Read more of the latest browser security newsFor example, the script nonce attribute, set to an unpredictable token for every page load, “acts as a guarantee that a given script is under the control of the application”.According to Google, even if part of the page is injected by an attacker, “the browser will refuse to execute any injected script which doesn’t identify itself with the correct nonce”.This mitigates the impact of any server-side injection vulnerabilities including reflected XSS and stored XSS.Content Security Policy refinementsGoogle has implemented these improvements through refinements in its Content Security Policy (CSP).“CSP has mitigated the exploitation of over 30 high-risk XSS flaws across Google in the past two years,” the tech giant said.“Nonce-based CSP is supported in Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers. Partial support for this variant of CSP is also available in Safari.”Elsewhere, Fetch Metadata request headers, which the browser attaches to outgoing HTTP requests, offer applications with trustworthy information about the provenance of requests sent to the server.The mechanism offers a defense against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and a new family of web-based privacy-leaking techniques known as XS-leaks.READ MORE What is Fetch Metadata? How to protect your web resources from information-stealing attacksCross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP) allows developers to lock down their web applications to restrict interactions with browser windows belonging to other applications, a feature that can result in information leak vulnerabilities.COOP debuted in Chrome 83 and Firefox 79.A blog post by Mozilla web security expert Anne van Kesteren offers a technical background on the non-profit’s implementation of COOP, placing it in the wider context of efforts to improve browser security and memory management.“With Chrome’s Site Isolation and Firefox’s Project Fission, browsers will isolate each site into its own process,” van Kesteren writes. “This is possible due to the web platform’s retrofitted same-origin policy.”Project Fission: New Firefox security featuresProject Fission was central in Mozilla’s effort to improve browser security last year, a Mozilla spokesperson told The Daily Swig:In 2020, Mozilla has worked hard to make the internet safer for all users. The Firefox security team played a major role in making this happen. A primary focus for this group has been Project Fission, Mozilla’s implementation of Site Isolation in Firefox, which can currently be tested in the Nightly version of the browser.Along with Cross-Origin Opener and Embedder Policy, it is part of Mozilla’s mitigations against Spectre-style attacks.Additional work includes prototyping and helping design Fetch Metadata request headers and the HTML Sanitizer API. These will likely be rolled out in Firefox once they are standardized.As part of our privacy efforts we’ve also worked on network partitioning, ensuring websites do not share network state. This also happens to address a class of security attacks known as XS-Leaks. It can be tested in Nightly now and will soon make it to release.Start your enginesSupport for these security mitigations is first added to browser engines that underpin today’s search experience. Chrome and all Chromium-based browsers inherit everything the Blink rendering engine and V8 JavaScript engine have to offer. Browsers like Firefox and Tor Browser are powered by Gecko.Finally, Apple Safari and a handful of gaming console browsers (including the PS4 and Nintendo Switch) inherit their security improvements via the proprietary WebKit engine.All browsers on iOS must run with WebKit under the hood.RELATED Sony awards $10,000 bug bounty for PlayStation 4 kernel exploitGoogle is positioning all of these security features as building blocks in the development of a more secure web ecosystem.The Daily Swig spoke to Santiago Diaz, an information security engineer at Google, about the latest wave of browser enhancements.The security pro explained that the problem can be divided into two buckets – injection vulnerabilities and isolation issues.“The solution is a number of mitigations to address each bucket. On the injection side of things, we have Trusted Types and CSP3.“On the isolation side of things, we have Resource Isolation, Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP), Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP), Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP), and Origin Isolation,” he added.‘Battle-tested mitigations’ for DOM-based XSSAccording to Diaz, on the injection side, CSP3 and Trusted Types are “battle-tested mitigations that make the vast majority of DOM-based XSS unexploitable when used correctly”.“Only Chrome supports both,” he explained. “Firefox supports CSP3 and is working towards Trusted Types, and unfortunately Safari, the renegade browser, supports neither Trusted Types nor CSP3.“CSP3 (nonce-based policies) is a pivotal part of the puzzle that Safari seems to completely neglect.”Browser red team exercisesThe Daily Swig asked Diaz if Google has carried out analysis on the browser security features from the perspective of an attacker.“Defects have been found through research on how security mitigations can enable attacks,” he said.“I can’t provide details on the research and unfortunately much of this is still undisclosed, but @shhnjk [Jun Kokatsu] from Microsoft has published their attacks. Rest assured, there’s been research on both bypasses and unintended side effects caused by new features.”Many of the enhanced security features are being deployed by default, but this varies between browser engine developers.For Google, SameSite cookies, Trusted Types enforcement (when a policy is present), CORB, resource isolation headers, and site isolation are enabled by default in Chrome.INSIGHT Will the coronavirus pandemic impact browser security?Diaz said: “Firefox is working on Project Fission to enable some of these, but it hasn’t been released to production yet. Safari has released Intelligent Tracking Prevention, a mitigation somewhat similar to SameSite cookies.”And finally, are there any plans to change the behavior of features such as document.write (the source of a lot of XSS holes and performance issues)?Diaz responded: “While changing this behavior would generally break backward compatibility, we hope direct string assignments will be highly discouraged in the future.“document.domain is one of the APIs that is still a major blocker to do this. Trusted Types is one way in which we’re trying to achieve a future of a web that uses types and not strings.”RELATED Websites that use mix of HTTP, HTTPS schemes may break under new Chrome SameSite rules",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/browser-security-briefing-google-and-mozilla-lay-the-groundwork-for-a-post-xss-world,"['Browsers', 'XSS', 'XS-Leak', 'CSRF', 'Google', 'Chrome', 'Mozilla', 'firefox', 'Apple', 'Research', 'Industry', 'News', 'Edge', 'Interviews', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Mobile', 'Gaming', 'Analysis', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Windows', 'Secure', 'Development']"
no,Misconfigurations in Spring Data projects could leave web apps open to abuse,"Flaw allowed attacker to view, modify, and delete data","A security researcher has detailed how a “critical” bug in the Spring Data project could be abused to expose and modify web application user data.The issue lies within Spring’s Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS) feature. ALPS is defined as “a data format for defining simple descriptions of application-level semantics”, similar to an API definition.ALPS is used in a number of applications including Spring Data, an umbrella project from the Spring programming framework that features several data access modules.One of the key features of Spring Data is the ability to expose a discoverable REST API. The feature uses ALPS as a way to describe the semantics of the RESTful application.Read more of the latest cybersecurity vulnerability newsUnderstanding these semantics can enable a threat actor to determine how to communicate with the exposed APIs, as well as identify common misconfigurations such as unauthenticated access, or methods being accidentally exposed, the researcher, known as Niemand, wrote in a blog post.By identifying the API’s misconfigurations, an attacker could then abuse them.Niemand wrote how he was able to exploit ALPS in Spring Data in order to view, edit, and delete data within a web application.Unauthenticated exploitThe security consultant was able to find, view, and leak all user information, as well as add new elements (such as admin users), and delete objects, as detailed in the blog post.The ALPS definition itself is not malicious, Niemand explained. “However, it helps attackers to obtain information about the REST API and easily validate misconfiguration issues on them,” he told The Daily Swig.“Endpoints that are not protected by the @pre and @post Spring security features will allow attackers to have full access to the REST API depending on the vulnerable endpoints.RECOMMENDED Facebook flaw meant attackers could create posts on any verified page“Some common cases are [the ability to] list all object instances for the entire repository, modification of existing entries, creation of new ones, and even deletion of the data being stored on the application.”Niemand added: “In my case, the application was exposing two profiles to unauthenticated users – users and companies.“I was able to access to a full detailed list of all the accounts and companies that were part of the application, as well as create, modify, or delete any information that belongs to both profiles.”No REST for the wickedTo protect against the misconfigurations, Niemand pointed to Spring Security’s PreAuthorization model which provides a detailed model for protecting Spring Data repositories.Spring Security annotations can also allow developers to create Spring Security SpEL expressions, that provide authentication, authorization, and protection, he said.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE This NXP side-channel attack can clone Google Titan 2FA keys",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/misconfigurations-in-spring-data-projects-could-leave-web-apps-open-to-abuse,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Data', 'Leak', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Research', 'Database', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'Hacking', 'News', 'API', 'Side-channel']"
no,Ubiquiti urges password reset in response to third-party breach,Cloud computing vendor advises customers to take precautionary measures,"Networking and Internet of Things (IoT) vendor Ubiquiti has urged its customers to change their passwords following a security breach it has blamed on an unnamed third-party cloud provider.Ubiquiti – a manufacturer of cloud-connected routers, network video recorders, security cameras, and access control systems – warned customers via email that a third-party cloud provider may have inadvertently exposed customer account information.The company is urging customers to change their passwords and enable multi-factor authentication in response to the breach, which may have exposed details such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses.A statement reads:We recently became aware of unauthorized access to certain [parts] of our information technology systems hosted by a third-party cloud provider. We have no indication that there has been unauthorized activity with respect to any user’s account.We are not currently aware of evidence of access to any databases that host user data, but we cannot be certain that user data has not been exposed. This data may include your name, email address, and the one-way encrypted password to your account (in technical terms, the passwords are hashed and salted). The data may also include your address and phone number if you have provided that to us.The breach notification email sent to customers (extract above), in which Ubiquiti goes on to apologize for any inconvenience, has been reposted on a community forum. The vendor confirmed the authenticity of this message through its official Twitter feed.The incident, first reported by technology journalist Brian Krebs, illustrates how the reliance of many technology firms on third party suppliers leaves them at heightened risk of attack.The Daily Swig approached Ubiquiti for further comment on the incident.James McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, said: “Organizations need to increase their third-party access procedures, training, and technology to reduce the risk of attack by a third-party vendor.”“Cybercriminals will continue to leverage attacks against smaller organizations to work their way into larger ones that are already authorizing the users,” he added.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Data breach at New Zealand’s Reserve Bank after third-party service hack",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ubiquiti-urges-password-reset-in-response-to-third-party-breach,"['Data', 'Breach', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'IoT', 'Passwords', 'Authentication']"
no,This NXP side-channel attack can clone Google Titan 2FA keys,"However, Google says attack doesn’t materially undermine Titan’s remote access protection","A new side-channel attack exploiting a vulnerability in NXP chipsets can be used to clone Google Titan Security Keys.On January 7, Ninjalab’s Victor Lomné and Thomas Roche published a research paper, ‘A Side Journey to Titan’ (PDF), which explores how an attack can be launched against NXP A7005a chips to extract private keys and clone security devices.Tracked as CVE-2021-3011, the vulnerability is described as an “electromagnetic-wave side-channel issue” that allows attackers to “extract the ECDSA private key after extensive physical access (and consequently produce a clone)”.Read more of the latest authentication newsLomné and Roche demonstrated the security flaw on the Google Titan Security key, a FIDO U2F hardware device designed to implement two-factor authentication (2FA) through the generation of a cryptographic token in order to verify the legitimacy of a user, thus preventing phishing and account takeovers.A remote attack would have severe ramifications for 2FA hardware products. However, it is important to note that a threat actor must have physical access to a Titan device to perform the side-channel attack.Radiation patternsGoogle Titan’s secure element, the NXP A700X chip, was the subject of the research. After peeling away the Titan’s protective case, the team examined the NXP hardware and observed the electromagnetic radiation expelled during ECDSA signatures, a key element of FIDO U2F cryptographic protocols.Custom software and algorithms were developed by the team to pick apart patterns in the hardware’s local radiation when authentication requests were made by the device, leading to the leak of partial ECDSA key information.It took 6,000 observations for the successful extraction of a ECDSA private key linked to a Google Titan FIDO U2F account, allowing the device to be cloned.Yubico’s YubiKey NEO and FEITIAN devices were also found to be vulnerable to the technique – albeit a costly and time-consuming endeavor.Each attack would only relate to a single target application, and a threat actor would not only need to probe the Google Titan key for at least several hours, but would also need to know the target account’s standard username and password credentials to access an app or service.Mitigating factorsThe Google Titan attack was validated in July 2020. Google and other vendors were alerted to the research and given technical details on October 1.On October 21, the Google Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) acknowledged the research and gave the cybersecurity team an “honorable mention” in the Hall of Fame but no financial reward.According to Google, as the attack relies on a microcontroller package which is not owned by the company, the research is “technically out of scope” for Google VRP.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/this-nxp-side-channel-attack-can-clone-google-titan-2fa-keys,"['Google', 'Hardware', '2FA', 'Authentication', 'Hacking', 'Tools', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Encryption', 'Industry', 'News', 'Research', 'France', 'Europe', 'Side-channel']"
no,GitLab addresses numerous vulnerabilities in latest security release,Details withheld on security release to offer software developers an update window,"UPDATED GitLab installations need to be updated following the discovery of a set of security vulnerabilities that includes a critical access token theft issue.First up, insufficient validation of authentication parameters in GitLab Page for GitLab versions 11.5 onwards gives potential attackers the ability to steal a user’s API access token through GitLab Pages.The ‘high severity’ issue was reported by security researcher Ron Chan through GitLab’s HackerOne bug bounty program.Catch up with the latest news on secure software developmentThe patch update last Thursday also deals with four lesser ‘medium severity’ issues.Firstly, there’s a vulnerability (CVE-2021-22166) that means an attacker could cause a Prometheus denial of service in GitLab 13.7 onwards by sending an HTTP request with a malformed method.A second flaw – affecting all versions of GitLab from 12.1 onwards – means that incorrect headers within a specific project page allows an attacker to have temporary read access to a public repository even if it is restricted to members only.The issue was discovered by security researcher Anshraj Srivastava and reported through HackerOne.Also on the patch list is a denial-of-service issue in the NuGet API that was discovered internally by the GitLab team.Next up is a further denial-of-service issue, this time involving package uploads. “The regex used for package names is written in a way that makes execution time have quadratic growth based on the length of the malicious input string,” GitLab explained.Patch detailsUpdates released last week include stability and performance enhancements, some of which address issues involving earlier patches.The patches come together in a big tent under 13.7.2, 13.6.4, and 13.5.6 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE), as explained in an advisory from GitLab.The Daily Swig reached out to Chan for comment on the vulnerability he discovered. We’ll update this story as and when more info comes to hand.Leom Burke, a senior web developer at PortSwigger Web Security (note: The Daily Swig’s parent company) and longstanding DevSecOps practitioner, commented: “The biggest change looks to be an issue in specific Oauth implementations which may cause some minor inconvenience to some users.“In general, for most applications these sort of security patch releases don’t have too many issues for users unless the user is exploiting the ‘bug’ for other purposes,” he added.This article has been updated to fix incorrect statements regarding GitLab’s monthly patch cycle.

no,Facebook flaw meant attackers could create invisible posts on any verified page,Discovery and post-fix bypass earn bug hunter two $15k payouts,"A security researcher has netted $30,000 in bug bounties after demonstrating how to create hidden posts on any Facebook page without authorization – before promptly bypassing the company’s initial bug fix.An attacker exploiting the flaw could then “share a post in another group/person/page” and “the post will be displayed” as originating “from the victim’s page”, Pouya Darabi told The Daily Swig.They could even implant malicious posts on pages verified by Facebook. “People trust these pages because they know they are officially approved,” said the researcher.Citing Facebook’s very own social media page as vulnerable, he added: “The user can be sure of the site address (it’s facebook.com) and clicking on the page, [they] will go to the official Facebook page again, so there is no doubt” about the page’s legitimacy.Darabi was awarded payouts of $15,000 for each exploit, which leveraged a critical security vulnerability in Facebook’s Creative Hub.Marketers can mock up ads in Creative Hub and create ‘invisible’ posts – meaning they are not publicly visible on the Facebook page – in order to preview and share the ads privately with colleagues, via a direct link, prior to distribution.Helpless admins“The page admins cannot view or delete them since they don’t have any links,” noted Darabi in a blog post outlining his discovery.After creating an invisible post on his own Facebook page, the researcher then intercepted Facebook’s request to create the post and switched the page_id to that of his hypothetical victim’s page. The change was duly saved “without any error or issue”.That “the permission was checked before generating the preview” indicated that Facebook had deemed Darabi to have a legitimate advertiser role for the target page.“After clicking on the share button” – a recently added Creative Hub feature for sharing mockup previews with colleagues – “the API will answer with a new shareable URL like this: https://www.facebook.com/ads/previewer/__PREVIEW_KEY__,” continued the researcher.RELATED Oculus, Facebook account takeovers net security researcher $30,000 bug bounty“The gotcha is that the permission-check is missing before generating a preview post on the share page.“Changing page_id before saving the mockup in [a] GraphQL request and then getting back the sharable link for it, gives us the ability to create a post on any page.“All we need to do is to find the post_id that exists on any ad preview endpoints,” added Darabi.“Finally, we created an invisible post on the victim page without their knowledge!”The sharing feature also “allows us to do the attack without sending a link,” the researcher told The Daily Swig.Foiling the fixDarabi then circumvented Facebook’s fix with a request – AsyncRequest.post('/ads/previewer/notify_mobile/__PREVIEW_KEY__',{}) – that created a post page and sent a notification to his mobile device.The ‘send to mobile’ feature then created “a preview again without checking permission”.Darabi has produced proof-of-concept videos for both the initial exploit and post-fix bypass.Read more of the latest bug bounty news‘No evidence of abuse’The researcher alerted Facebook to the flaw on November 6 and the first fix was implemented on November 11.After being notified of the subsequent bypass on November 12, the advertising and social media giant rolled out a final remedy on November 20.Facebook said it had “found no evidence of abuse” of the vulnerability in the wild.In its response to Darabi, the platform indicated that the bug bounty payout would have been higher still had the bug allowed attackers to create visible posts.RELATED Oculus, Facebook account takeovers net security researcher $30,000 bug bounty",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/facebook-flaw-meant-attackers-could-create-invisible-posts-on-any-verified-page,"['Vulnerabilities', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'Social', 'Media', 'Facebook', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Research', 'Mobile']"
no,"CrackQ tool adds GUI, analysis features to Hashcat password-cracking platform","Currently in first release, the tool will have a raft of new features added in the coming months","A new open source tool makes it easier to use Hashcat, the powerful password-cracking, command-line tool that uses the power of graphics cards to find the plaintext equivalent of hashed passwords.CrackQ provides a REST API and a JavaScript graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with Hashcat.Dan Turner, the developer of CrackQ and a career penetration tester, told The Daily Swig that the goal of CrackQ was to help improve the efficiency of Hashcat, which has become very popular among penetration testers, red teams, and other offensive security researchers.Results dashboardCrackQ is not the first GUI tool written for Hashcat, but it has several characteristics that make it unique. The tool is written in Python and interfaces with Hashcat through the libhashcat library.Python also has many great data science libraries, which make it easier to add analysis and reporting features to Hashcat.CrackQ can generate various analysis reports and dashboards from Hashcat results, including timing and speed, insecure password patterns, and heatmaps of common city names used in passwords.CrackQ provides a GUI for the Hashcat password-cracking toolOther Hashcat tools use distributed computing, where they share the load among several computers. CrackQ, on the other hand, uses a server/client architecture, with all commands running on the server.“Pen test/red teams commonly use dedicated GPU servers or custom-built rigs, which are then shared by the team,” Turner says.“However, the application is built using Docker containers. This means that it’s a simple process to quickly create a cloud instance, if that is more suitable for you.”Single sign-onCrackQ uses SAML2 authentication, which allows users to offload credential management to an identity provider such as Active Directory and to use multi-factor authentication.“I needed something I could integrate with single sign-on (SSO) to avoid managing user numbers approaching 100 accounts,” Turner says.READ MORE Latest hacking tools – Q4 2020CrackQ is currently in first release. Turner will be expanding the feature set in the coming months.“This first version was all about setting up a good base, ensuring it’s a very stable application and making it more accessible to everyone,” he said.“I’m looking forward to the next steps, which will involve adding a lot of automation and improving the analysis/reporting, which will also increase the usability for blue teams.”RECOMMENDED Meet urlhunter, the URLTeam companion and shortened URL search engine",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/crackq-tool-adds-gui-analysis-features-to-hashcat-password-cracking-platform,"['Hacking', 'Tools', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'API', 'Passwords', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Authentication', 'Database', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Email', 'Security', 'Python', 'JavaScript']"
no,Data breach at New Zealand’s Reserve Bank after third-party service hack,Security incident at file transfer provider potentially leaks sensitive information,"New Zealand’s central bank has suffered a data breach after an unknown actor gained unauthorized access to a third-party file sharing service.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te P?tea Matua – confirmed on Sunday (January 10) that sensitive personal and commercial information had potentially been accessed by the malicious hacker.The breach has since been contained, the bank said. Its core business functions “remain sound and operational”.Non-specific attackReserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr said that the attack against the Accellion FTA file-sharing software was not specific to the bank.Orr said in a statement: “We have been advised by the third-party provider that this wasn’t a specific attack on the Reserve Bank, and other users of the file sharing application were also compromised.”The affected system has been taken offline, though no further details have been released about the incident by the bank, as it said that “providing any further details at this early stage could adversely affect the investigation and the steps being taken to mitigate the breach”.It also isn’t clear how many customers have been potentially affected in the breach or whether financial information was taken.

no,Encrypted Client Hello: Upcoming Firefox 85 rollout builds momentum for ESNI successor,ECH hopes to remedy the interoperability and deployment challenges of its predecessor,"UPDATED Mozilla has announced plans to replace an earlier browser encryption technology with Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), staring with Firefox 85.More specifically Draft 8 of ECH offers a successor to the similar, but less sophisticated Encrypted SNI (ESNI) technology, whose recently revealed shortcomings were deemed to make it unsuitable as a privacy technology.“To address the shortcomings of ESNI, recent versions of the specification no longer encrypt only the SNI extension and instead encrypt an entire Client Hello message (thus the name change from ‘ESNI’ to ‘ECH’),” Mozilla explained in a blog post announcing its adoption of the technology.You say goodbye…Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that allows multiple secure websites to be served on the same IP address. The technology transmits the domain name of the website you want to visit in plaintext.ESNI masks a server’s name so that ISPs or WiFi hotspot providers can’t infer a user’s surfing habits.However, analysis has shown that encrypting only the SNI extension provides incomplete privacy protection for web users.For example, “during session resumption, the Pre-Shared Key extension could, legally, contain a cleartext copy of exactly the same server name that is encrypted by ESNI”, Mozilla explained.In addition, real-world attempts to deploy ESNI have run afoul of interoperability and deployment challenges that mitigate against its widespread usage.… I say helloECH is far more than just a renamed update to ESNI. For example, ECH also adds a retry mechanism to increase reliability with respect to server key rotation and DNS caching.Put simply, ECH encrypts the full handshake so that sensitive metadata is kept secret.Used in conjunction, both ECH and DNS-over-HTTPS are aimed at offering end-to-end user privacy.Mozilla working with Cloudflare, are earlier adopter of the technology, and others on standardizing the Encrypted Client Hello specification at the Internet Engineering Task Force.A blog post by Cloudflare provides a technical backgrounder on ECH.In response to queries from The Daily Swig, Cloudflare said it is actively working on various aspects of the Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) project with Mozilla, including working on finishing the specification for ECH at the IETF.Cloudflare’s head of research, Nick Sullivan, added that it was also “writing an implementation of the emerging standard in Go and contributing to an implementation in BoringSSL. We are working with Mozilla to validate our implementations,” he added.The rollout of ECH by Cloudflare is set to gather momentum this year.Sullivan explained that Cloudflare is “building support for ECH into Cloudflare's global network with an intent to enable support for ECH for Cloudflare customers in 2021.”“This implementation is meant to be compatible with all browsers that plan on supporting ECH, including Firefox,” he added.An update to Draft 9 of the protocol (which is targeted for wider interoperability testing and deployment) is forthcoming, according to Mozilla.The Daily Swig also asked Mozilla to comment on how it was working together with CloudFlare as well as a line on challenges might arise when it comes to deploying ECH at scale.

No,Russian cybercriminal sentenced to 12 years for ‘massive hacking campaign’ impacting 100 million US citizens,"Andrei Tyurin played ‘major’ role in operation targeting JP Morgan Chase Bank, Wall Street Journal, and others","A Russian citizen has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for his involvement in a “massive” computer hacking campaign that saw the theft of 100 million individuals’ data.Andrei Tyurin, 37, of Moscow, was handed a 144-month detention order by a New York court yesterday for his part in the cybercrime operation against US financial institutions, brokerage firms, news publishers, and other targets.Together with a team of co-conspirators, Tyurin played a “major role” in one of the biggest thefts of financial data in US history, stealing the personal information of more than 80 million JP Morgan Chase Bank customers.Tyurin pleaded guilty to charges of computer intrusion, wire fraud, bank fraud, and illegal online gambling offenses, a statement from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) reads.Financial targetsFrom 2012 to mid-2015, Tyurin and others targeted JP Morgan, Scottrade, E Trade, and the Wall Street Journal, stealing more than 100 million customers’ personal data.Tyruin used servers located across five continents, which he controlled from his home in Moscow, maintaining persistent access over extended periods of time to the victims’ networks, regularly refreshing the stolen data by repeatedly downloading information from these companies.The defendant, who the US court said engaged in these crimes under the direction of his partner, Gery Shalon, also took part in other crimes including fraud schemes, earning him more than $19 million.Read more of the latest cybercrime newsFor example, in an effort to artificially inflate the price of certain stocks publicly traded in the US, Shalon and his co-conspirators marketed the stocks in a deceptive and misleading manner to customers of the victim companies whose contact information Tyurin stole, said the DoJ.Tyurin also conducted cyber-attacks against numerous companies in the US and other countries, including unlawful internet gambling businesses and international payment processors.To avoid detection of the group’s criminal schemes, Tyurin targeted a merchant risk intelligence firm based in the US that was responsible for auditing potentially fraudulent online credit card transactions on behalf of major payment processing networks.Payback time“Once his hacking activities were detected, Tyurin worked with Shalon to destroy the evidence of their criminal activity and undermine US law enforcement’s efforts to identify and arrest them,” said the DoJ.In addition to his 12-year sentence, Tyurin was ordered to serve three years’ supervision upon his release, and to pay back the $19.2 million.He has been in US custody since he was extradited from the country of Georgia in September 2018 and will begin his sentence immediately.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE US court order brings down the shutters on tech support scam impacting the elderly",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/russian-cybercriminal-sentenced-to-12-years-for-massive-hacking-campaign-impacting-100-million-us-citizens,"['Cybercrime', 'US', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Finance', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Legal', 'Network', 'Security', 'Privacy', 'Russia', 'North', 'America', 'Organizations', 'Fraud']"
no,"NSA advises defense, national security supply chain on replacing deprecated encryption protocols","But guidance should be heeded by all sysadmins, says agency","The US National Security Agency (NSA) has published guidelines instructing government agencies and suppliers involved in defense and national security on how to update obsolete encryption protocols.Published on January 5, the recommendations (PDF) advise system administrators on how to detect and “replace unauthorized or deprecated TLS protocols with ones that meet current standards”, the agency said in a press release.The advice extends to implementing a strong cipher suite and key exchange methods, plus server certificates issued by an authorized certification authority.The NSA has also published server configurations and network signatures on its GitHub repository to help sysadmins update their network components.TLS laggards“Remediation is crucial to decreasing computer system and network attack surfaces and preventing unauthorized access to private data,” said the NSA.“Obsolete TLS configurations are still in use in US Government systems” despite the NSA previously releasing urgent guidance on the issue, reads the guidance. “While the standards and most products have been updated, implementations often have not kept up.”BACKGROUND TLS 1.0/1.1 end-of-life countdown heads into the danger zoneThe guidelines are aimed at helping the Department of Defense (DoD), National Security System (agencies or contractors involved in national security), and Defense Industrial Base (weapons systems supply chain) comply with the Committee on National Security Systems Policy 15 (PDF), and guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Committee on National Security Systems.However, the guidelines also say: “Since these risks affect all networks, all network owners and operators should consider taking these actions to reduce their risk exposure and make their systems harder targets for malicious threat actors.”‘Very few’ technical skillsExploiting obsolete TLS protocol configurations requires “very few” technical skills, according to an infographic (PDF) published by the NSA to illustrate the threat.Adversaries, say the guidelines, can use techniques such as “passive decryption and modification of traffic through man-in-the-middle attacks” (MitM) to access sensitive data such asproprietary information, sensitive network files, HTTPS web traffic, passwords, and social security numbers.New attack techniques for breaking TLS encryption emerge periodically.‘A little disappointed’Robert Merget, chair for network and data security at the Ruhr University Bochum, welcomed the guidance – but expressed reservations about certain specifics.“Having a good TLS configuration and implementation is elemental, as it often is the first line of defense against Man-in-the-Middle attacks and mass surveillance,” he told The Daily Swig.Read more of the latest network security newsGovernment guidance is “often a major driving factor for better cryptography, not only for government services but also for the industry in general,” he added.“Therefore, I appreciate that the NSA supports recent movements away from TLS 1.0 and 1.1 towards the more secure TLS 1.2 and 1.3.“However, I am a little disappointed that the NSA still recommends RSA and DH(E) key exchange algorithms, as both have shown to have weaknesses and implementation pitfalls in the past.“I was also surprised that the CBC-mode was not explicitly mentioned, as it is also a common cause for implementation errors in TLS and should be avoided if possible.”RELATED Difficult-to-execute attack could break TLS encryption in rare circumstances",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/nsa-advises-defense-national-security-supply-chain-on-replacing-deprecated-encryption-protocols,"['US', 'Government', 'TLS', 'Encryption', 'North', 'America', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Secure', 'Development', 'Industry', 'News', 'Network', 'Security', 'Authentication', 'Data', 'Breach', 'MitM', 'Database', 'Security', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Passwords']"

I am hopeful the country and our nation’s leaders will focus on peace and safety and civility.“The storming of the offices and potential targeting of digital devices is deeply concerning and something I advise executives both in private sector and government settings to have a playbook for.“The WH CIO has no jurisdiction over the hill but can offer support and ideas as colleagues.”Payton added: “I highly recommend that devices be forensically examined, data logs be checked, and after the forensics are completed, out of an abundance of caution I would do a factory reset before using [them].“If devices are stolen, I would either geolocate the device or render it useless using an enterprise device management solution to do what we call in the industry ‘brick the device.’” There have been no confirmed reports of government laptops or other hardware being stolen, although local media did report that the man pictured in Pelosi’s office left with an envelope from her desk – a claim which he denies.Social media suspensionLast night also saw President Trump’s Facebook and Twitter accounts suspended after he posted videos that were deemed to violate the social media platforms’ guidelines.One of the videos saw Trump continuing to spread his false narrative that the election was stolen from him. He also sent his “love” to his supporters outside of the Capitol Building.A statement from Twitter read: “As a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, DC, we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy.”A woman wearing a MAGA hat sits in a government office after Trump supporters raided the Capitol BuildingTwitter also threatened to permanently ban Trump from the platform if he continued to violate its policies.Similarly, Facebook tweeted: “We’ve assessed two policy violations against President Trump’s page which will result in a 24-hour feature block, meaning he will lose the ability to post on the platform during that time.”He later told the rioters to go home but did not condemn their actions.Fake newsTrump has been repeatedly accused of spreading misinformation during his time in office.Since coming to office in 2016, the former reality television personality has been vocal about his war against so-called “fake news”, claiming that the media was the “enemy” of the American people.This is despite Trump himself making numerous false claims over the years, including the suggestion that injecting oneself with disinfectant could kill Covid-19, and that thousands of votes in his favor were purposely not counted during the 2020 Presidential Election.This article has been updated to include comment from Theresa Payton, former White House CIOYOU MAY ALSO LIKE US government offers $10 million reward for information on cyber interference in elections",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/national-security-concerns-raised-as-trump-loyalists-storm-us-capitol,"['US', 'Election', 'Security', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Government', 'Network', 'Security', 'Policy', 'and', 'Legislation', 'Hardware', 'Privacy', 'Legal']"

no,"Substandard software costs US economy $2tn through security flaws, legacy systems, abandoned projects",Tech consortium urges adoption of ‘DevQualOps’ model,"UPDATED Security vulnerabilities and other software shortcomings cost the US economy more than $2 trillion in 2020, according to a new report.Operational software failures were by far the biggest contributor, with Home Depot’s recent multi-state data breach settlement of $17.5 million for a 2014 payment card breach cited as one egregious example.The research, published today (January 6) by the Consortium for Information & Software Quality (CISQ), estimates the total cost of these failures at $1.56 trillion – a 22% jump on the 2018 figure (PDF).What’s more, this number could underestimate the true cost of what are usually unresolved application flaws, given that many failures go unreported, says the report, which is sponsored by Undo, Synopsys, and OverOps.During a bumper two years for cyber-crooks, “exploitable weaknesses and vulnerabilities in software” were “the largest growth area by far” in cybercrime, a trend likely to continue, said Herb Krasner, member of CISQ’s advisory board and author of the report.Problems with legacy systems, meanwhile, incurred costs of around $520 billion, while the cost of unsuccessful development projects – around one in five of all projects – led to costs of approximately $260 billion.Separately, technical debt was valued at $1.31 trillion (not including interest).Ballooning attack surfaceCybersecurity budgets are set to increase amid widespread exploitation of the Covid-19 pandemic by cybercriminals and the ballooning attack surface, with billions of lines of new software code being written each year.Despite these expanding budgets, however, Krasner raised concerns about how the global cybersecurity skills gap was forcing software engineers to build software out of open source components without necessarily understanding whether or not they contained security vulnerabilities.Read more of the latest cybersecurity industry newsPreventing vulnerabilities should be the priority, said Krasner. Failing that, organizations must “address weaknesses and vulnerabilities in software by isolating, mitigating, and correcting them as closely as possible to where they were injected to limit the damage done.”The CISQ report recommends that, among other things, development teams measure undertake “early and regular analysis of source code to detect violations, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities”, and understand “typical vulnerabilities and exploitable weaknesses attributable to certain programming languages”.‘Start, define, measure, manage’Fundamental to achieving these goals is progressing beyond agile and DevOps models, where the testing and commitment of “small, incremental changes” on a “daily, hourly, or even moment-by-moment” basis accelerates development cycles but doesn’t necessarily enhance quality.Organizations must instead cleave to the so-called ‘DevQualOps’ model, of which DevSecOps is a sub-factor. “A ‘start, define, measure, manage’ approach enables the organization to break free from ‘anything-goes’ approaches to quality and starts the journey towards DevQualOps maturity.”Joe Jarzombek, director for government and critical infrastructure programs at Synopsys, told The Daily Swig that he expected DevSecOps, and therefore by default DevQualOps, practices to become widely adopted in 2021 because “these best practices and tools are [widely] available for adoption, and organizations have become sensitized to exploitation of their software products.“As such organizations that have traditionally focused on quality with security as a separate function have sought ways to better integrate security with quality.He added: “While it would be more correct call this DevQualOps as specified in the CPSQ Report (especially since security is just one characteristic of quality), the term DevSecOps will continue to dominate. Given the overall lax focus on security in the past, it is appropriate to keep DevSecOps in the forefront of adoption (knowing that this is a key part of focusing on quality).“This has been a long way of saying DevSecOps is becoming more mainstream, even though many organizations are still on the path for full adoption of the applicable practices with the right tools.”This article was updated on January 6 with comments from SynopsysRECOMMENDED Fines against banks for data breaches and noncompliance more than doubled in 2020",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/substandard-software-costs-us-economy-2tn-through-security-flaws-legacy-systems-abandoned-projects,"['Research', 'Industry', 'News', 'US', 'North', 'America', 'DevOps', 'DevSecOps', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Cloud', 'Security', 'Network', 'Security', 'Database', 'Security', 'Data', 'Breach', 'Cybercrime', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Coronavirus']"
no,Gossamer tool aims to defend open source projects against SolarWinds-style supply chain attacks,Efforts to secure WordPress and Composer tracked on new website,"The software supply chain attack against IT infrastructure vendor SolarWinds last year has served to revive interest in technologies that might mitigate against this kind of attack.Last month, the attack impacted numerous federal government agencies as well as Microsoft and threat detection firm FireEye.One promising project aiming to prevent such incidents is Gossamer, which is billed as offering supply chain security for open source software.Gossamer uses a combination of cryptographic signatures and transparency logs in order to safeguard software updates from tampering by making any malfeasance apparent.Transactions (such as issuing an update or adding a software signing key) are published on an append-only cryptographic ledger. The technology offers a means to verify who released an update as well as its authenticity.Tainted suppliesSolarWinds’ Orion software update platform was compromised in or around March 2020, nine months before the problem was detected by FireEye in December.Previous software supply chain attacks have included the infection of the M.E.Doc tax and financial reporting package mandated by the Ukrainian government with NotPetya, a destructive strain of malware back in 2017.The NotPetya attack disrupted the operation of multiple international firms and caused millions of dollars of damages with victims including FedEx and shipping giant Maersk.Paragon Initiative Enterprises (PIE), the PHP security and applied cryptography experts behind the technology, foresees a variety of use cases for the technology, including in WordPress’ Automatic Updates for Themes and Plugins, Composer (the PHP dependency manager), and NPM (the Node.js dependency manager).The development of Gossamer long predates SolarWinds which nonetheless serves as a “grim reminder” of the type of vulnerabilities IT suppliers are face with, PIE told The Daily Swig.Significant revisionsAs this timeline illustrates, the genesis of the Gossamer project dates way back to July 2014. The project has gone through numerous significant revisions in the six and a half years since its inception.Earlier this month, PIE launched a website to track the multiple ongoing parallel efforts to secure WordPress and Composer with Gossamer integration.The developer tools aspect of the project is described as two-thirds complete and “in progress”, whilst WordPress and Composer integration are both pending.Asked to explain how Gossamer projected against SolarWinds-like software supply chain attacks, a spokesperson for PIE told The Daily Swig: “The mechanism in Gossamer that helps with a SolarWinds-like attack is the attestations, which were specified in libgossamer in 2019.”Read more of the latest secure development newsAttestations allow third-party providers to assert some property about other software updates published by other providers.The spokesperson added: ""Our focus for 2021 is WordPress then Composer. We'll look at NPM/Maven/etc. in 2022 if successful.""A roadmap for the project explains that the ""ultimate goal of Gossamer is to ensure that PHP and WordPress developers have the capability of signing their open source software and verifying that the dependencies they install from third-party developers is authentic.”“When we have succeeded at securing the PHP ecosystem, we intend to assist other ecosystems (eg Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby) in securing their open source software supply chains.”RELATED Microsoft downplays threat after admitting SolarWinds hackers access source code",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/gossamer-tool-aims-to-defend-open-source-projects-against-solarwinds-style-supply-chain-attacks,"['Secure', 'Development', 'Supply', 'Chain', 'Attacks', 'Logistics', 'Open', 'Source', 'Software', 'PHP', 'Industry', 'News', 'Microsoft', 'Cyber-attacks', 'Cyber', 'Warfare', 'Government']"
no,QR code security: Best approaches to using the technology safely and securely,How to ensure your next scan doesn’t lead to a scam,"QR codes have a variety of uses, from storing bank information for payments to ordering at restaurants or joining a WiFi network.But the easy-to-use codes don’t come without security risks – a concern highlighted by numerous incidents in recent years.The Daily Swig takes a closer look at the potential security issues surrounding QR codes and the best approaches to using the technology safely.What are QR codes?Quick Response (QR) codes are two-dimensional barcodes used to enable users to access data or web-based resources (URLs).The technology, created in 1994 by Masahiro Hara from the Japanese company Denso Wave, was originally designed to track motor vehicle components through the manufacturing process.You’ll likely be familiar with their design: a series of black lines and squares on a white background.Although QR codes were invented almost three decades ago, it’s only in the past five years or so that they have been adopted by the western world at scale.This is partly due to Apple’s iOS 11 update back in 2017, which started allowing users to quickly and conveniently scan a QR code using the camera app. Soon after, Android followed suit.QR code adoption around the worldQR codes have enjoyed a huge upsurge in adoption across China, where they are scanned to collect wedding gifts at a gift registry, to identify pets, reply to job adverts, and much more.The tech is also used to both sign in and post in the WeChat messaging app and Alipay systems, meaning millions of citizens use QR codes every day.Read more of the latest news on coronavirus scams and phishing attacksWhile the technology may have initially been overlooked by the West, QR codes became more widely used in 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak.Businesses, governments, and other organizations turned to the technology as a way of tracking social movements.Governments in Europe, Asia, and the US also used QR codes as part of their coronavirus track-and-trace systems.Since then, the technology has become a way of life for more and more individuals worldwide.QR codes are extremely popular in ChinaQR code security concernsWhile the technology offers an almost endless number of applications, it is not without its security concerns.A study conducted last year by MobileIron states that while the majority of people (67%) know that a QR code opens a URL, 71% could not distinguish between a legitimate and malicious QR code.“QR codes are often used for phishing attacks,” Nazarii Uniiat, an IT security engineer for Clario, told The Daily Swig.“How? The simplest algorithm involves a phishing website that looks like the real one with a similar-looking official sign-in form.“QR codes are images and can’t be hacked. That’s because they’re static. However, they can be easily replaced. Again, in transport [locations] – the official QR codes are printed on branded paper.“But this won’t stop criminals from gluing the sticker with the fake QR of the same size on top of the official one.”How are QR codes abused in phishing attacks?Hank Schless, senior manager of security solutions at cybersecurity firm Lookout, described how he was able to pull off a simple phishing attack by planting a fake QR code at the RSA conference.“Our method was simple: a fake phishing attack using a QR code at our booth advertising a chance to win an iPhone,” he wrote in a blog post.“The code actually pointed to a URL that Lookout manually classified as malicious for the purpose of the demo, meaning that it would be immediately blocked if the user had Lookout phishing protection on their mobile device.”He added: “Luckily for them, our webpage was harmless and had a message educating them about mobile phishing. Had it been a real phishing scam, they could have put themselves and their corporate data at risk.”How do cybercriminals abuse QR codes in social engineering? attacks?QR codes facilitate social engineering attacks due to the fact users have to be willing to place a degree of blind faith that they will perform as advertised.“Perhaps the biggest risk from QR codes is that you don’t know what the code will resolve to until you have scanned it,” Vic Harkness, a security consultant at F-Secure, told The Daily Swig.“You are implicitly placing some trust in the security of the code when you scan it, that it will not induce your device to take some malicious action.RELATED Discord users warned over QR code login scam“QR codes are also often featured in social engineering attacks. QR codes can now be used to pay for a variety of goods and services, where the user simply scans a QR code with their banking app.“An attacker could create a QR code which would transfer £100 to their account when scanned, and place it over a QR code for a £1 item.“They could leave this in place and hope that a user didn’t pay attention to the numbers when scanning it.“Or, they could attempt to persuade a user to scan this code and make the payment in exchange for real-world cash. This type of scam has been seen in the Netherlands, where attackers convinced their victims to assist them in paying for parking tickets.”Are QR codes a reliable mechanism for contact tracing?It’s not just financial risks that come into play. As the world adopts the technology to enable coronavirus tracking, false or malicious codes could reduce the effectiveness of contact-tracing mechanisms.If a person who later tested Covid-positive had checked in using the fake restaurant code, explains Harkness, another person also present at the same time who had checked in using a legitimate code may not be traced.“There is no 100% effective way to perform contact tracing,” she added.“A careful balance needs to be struck between user privacy, and the effectiveness of tracking. Whilst the abuse of QR codes has the potential to reduce he effectiveness of contact tracing, their usage in this context does not present a significant security risk.“In my opinion, the use of QR codes in financial applications is much more worrying.”What alternatives are there to QR codes?While QR codes have boomed in popularity, other less well known technologies can provide much the same services – and sometimes more.Near Field Communication (NFC) tags, for example, arguably have more to offer than QR codes when it comes to the easy transfer of data.NFC is a radio-frequency technology that allows data to be transferred between an NFC tag and an NFC-enabled device.The reason why QR codes are more popular is pretty clear, however: QR codes are free to generate via websites or apps, while NFC tags need to contain an encoded chip for them to be read by a device.However, choosing QR over NFC does come at a security cost. NFC uses encryption as standard, which is particularly helpful when it comes to payment transactions. It also only works at limited range, meaning hackers cannot easily intercept NFC-enabled data transfers.And while QR codes can be encrypted, there is no way of telling whether one is or not, meaning it’s up to users to assess whether a particular code is likely to be safe.QR codes are quick, easy, and free to generate. This code, for example, leads to The Daily Swig homepageHow do you mitigate the dangers of malicious QR codes?Protecting against malicious QR codes at all costs is fairly simple – simply don’t scan them. This advice, however, can often be impractical in today’s society.Instead, users should inspect the QR code for any tampering and, if in doubt, try to verify its legitimacy before scanning.“If a QR code is obviously a sticker, question its legitimacy; if you are in a restaurant, ask the staff to clarify. If the code is on an advertisement, simply search for the subject online instead,” Harkness advised.“Ideally, the user should view what the QR code resolves to before it is acted upon. Some phones automatically do this; the default iPhone camera app creates a notification which displays the link text, inviting the user to click on it.“Although manually inspecting the link can help to detect less sophisticated attacks, it would not be difficult for an attacker to create a correct-looking QR code.“Generally, good security practice should be followed. Ensure that you install updates to your device as soon as they become available.“Although this cannot protect you against clickjacking or social engineering scams entirely, it can help to protect your phone from being readily exploited through such attacks.”YOU MAY ALSO LIKE OSINT: What is open source intelligence and how is it used?",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/qr-code-security-best-approaches-to-using-the-technology-safely-and-securely,"['Authentication', 'Mobile', 'Coronavirus', 'Phishing', 'Social', 'Engineering', 'Secure', 'Development', 'US', 'UK', 'China', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Japan', 'Encryption', 'Hardware', 'Retail', 'E-Commerce', 'Deep', 'Dives', 'Analysis', 'Finance']"
No,"Oculus, Facebook account takeovers net security researcher $30,000 bug bounty",XSS in virtual reality forum one of three flaws chained to land bumper payout,"A security researcher has earned a $30,000 bug bounty payout after seizing control of Facebook and Oculus accounts via exploitation of a trio of security vulnerabilities.Owners of Oculus virtual reality headsets can log into their Oculus accounts via Facebook, which acquired the virtual reality (VR) pioneer in 2014. (Its latest model, Oculus Quest 2, can only be used via Facebook, prompting Germany’s antitrust watchdog to launch a probe).Combined with two other flaws, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Oculus community forum domain could enable a malicious attacker to steal an Oculus access token and compromise the corresponding user’s accounts, Tunisian security researcher Youssef Sammouda discovered.“This was possible because [the] forums.oculusvr.com domain uses [the] oculus.com authentication mechanism to login users to the forum using [the] https://graph.oculus.com/authenticate_web_application/ endpoint,” Sammouda said in a blog post documenting his findings.This “would redirect him to https://forums.oculusvr.com/entry/oculus with an oculus access_token that could access graph.oculus.com/graphql and make GraphQL mutations/queries that allow him to takeover the account.”In the iframeSammouda found that if the script embedded in https://forums.oculusvr.com/plugins/oculus/js/oculus-oauth.js and had debug mode enabled, it insecurely used document.write to add state parameter content inside the URL’s fragment (#state=PAYLOAD).He served the payload with ‘state’, because although document.location was passed to document.write, it was in the payload’s URL-encoded format. Nevertheless, ‘state’ was in the decoded format.What seemed to be an “easy XSS” proved otherwise, since var loginType = this.frameElement.id preceded document.write – returning ‘TypeError: Cannot read property ‘id’ of null’.This could be solved to achieve an exploit by adding an iframe to https://forums.oculusvr.com/entry/oculus#state=payload and relaying the final link to the victim.RELATED Facebook pays out $25k bug bounty for chained DOM-based XSSThe researcher achieved this via Vanilla Forums, a third-party application hosted by the Oculus forum that allows embedded content from certain allow-listed websites.One such site contained a vulnerability (now patched) that permitted Sammouda to redirect the payload from the embedded Vanilla Forums page to https://forums.oculusvr.com/entry/oculus.Account takeover was initially stymied because changing the PIN or password, or adding contact points, required knowledge of a user PIN, while the Oculus forum domain couldn’t read the linked Facebook account access_token (a technique credited to fellow security researcher Josip Franjkovi?).Fortunately, Sammouda uncovered a third bug that allowed him “to upgrade the access_token to the context of another application” and bypass the Oculus forum’s “limited permissions”.The third-party application could read the linked Facebook access_token, paving the way for takeover of both the Facebook account and, via the endpoint https://graph.oculus.com/fbauth, the Oculus account.Sammouda told The Daily Swig that while chaining the bugs amplified the exploit’s severity, the XSS was only moderately difficult to unearth “since I already knew where to look for bugs (in code and endpoints added by Facebook to Vanilla Forums), and “the third one was easy to find since the vulnerable endpoint was mainly used for a similar purpose”.Just in scopeSammouda alerted Facebook to the flaws on November 24 and the social media giant fixed them on December 1.Although the forums.oculus.com domain is out of scope in Facebook’s bug bounty program because it hosts a third-party application, the social media company made an exception on this occasion since the XSS “was found in the authentication flow added by Facebook”, said the researcher.His bonus-inflated $30,000 payout surpasses the $25,000 he netted after unearthing a DOM-based XSS in Facebook in October 2020, as previously reported by The Daily Swig.",https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/oculus-facebook-account-takeovers-net-security-researcher-30-000-bug-bounty,"['Facebook', 'Bug', 'Bounty', 'XSS', 'Hacking', 'News', 'Research', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Hacking', 'Techniques', 'Social', 'Media']"

no,Google Docs bug allowed cyber-spies to screenshot private documents,‘Send Feedback’ flaw earns security researcher $3k bug bounty payout,"A security vulnerability in Google Docs allowed malicious hackers to take screenshots of private documents, a security researcher has found.Reported by Sreeram KL under the Google Vulnerability Reward Program, the bug arises from a misconfiguration in the popular online word processor.Stealing the screenshotMany Google products have a ‘Send Feedback’ feature that allows users to report issues (in Google Docs it is called ‘Help Docs improve’). The dialog includes an option to send a screenshot along with the report, which is enabled by default.Since the feature is shared across many applications, it is embedded as an iframe element from the main google.com domain.To enable interactions between the Google Docs window and feedback iframe, screenshots taken from the Google document are stored in feedback.googleusercontent.com and sent across domains.Sreeram’s goal was to find a way to cause the feedback iframe to post the screenshot to an arbitrary domain. Previous research has shown that misconfigurations in headers can create opportunities to steal information from iframes.PostMessage misconfigurationWebsites can include an x-frame-options header that, if set, can prevent clickjacking attacks and redirection of post messages to other domains.Unfortunately for Google, the header was missing from the Google Docs application, so when you embedded it as an iframe in another webpage, you could manipulate the post destination of its inner iframes, namely the feedback dialog.When a user types in feedback and clicks send, the screenshot of the Google document is sent to the attacker’s arbitrary domain.“PostMessage misconfiguration has been a hot topic in recent times, so I was actively looking for one on Google products,” Sreeram told The Daily Swig.Catch up with the latest bug bounty security newsThe researcher was also inspired by a solution to one of bug bounty platform Intigriti’s cross-site scripting (XSS) challenges.“I was always amazed by Intigriti's XSS challenges. I wanted to exploit quirks from those challenges in real-world applications – and it worked,” he said.Sreeram posted a proof-of-concept video on YouTube:This kind of bug is not limited to Google web applications.“I strongly believe many other websites could also be affected by the similar bug, because many people aren't really aware that the location of iframes can be replaced by a cross-origin domain,” the researcher warned.Sreeram is currently ranked 37 on Google VRP’s hall of fame. This catch netted him a $3,100 bug bounty.

no,"‘Critical’ RCE, account takeover flaws patched in Rock RMS church management platform",Open source CRM software is used by at least 500 churches globally,"UPDATED Rock RMS, a ‘relationship management system’ for churches, was affected by a pair of vulnerabilities that could lead to account takeover and remote code execution (RCE).Security researchers who unearthed these and several other less serious flaws in the open source application have urged users to update their systems as soon as possible.Perhaps best described as a customer relationship management (CRM) platform for religious institutions, Rock RMS enables church leaders to track attendance, handle online donations, and manage relationships with their congregations, among other features.Nearly 550 churches globally – but mostly in North America – reportedly use the platform.The application’s ongoing development is funded through voluntary donations.File upload restriction bypassThe researchers, from the ‘Cyber Security Research Group’, found what they deemed a critical logic flaw in how a block list function validates file extensions (CVE-2019-18643) that meant attackers could upload malicious files to any system directory via fileUpload.ashx and achieve RCE.Although the researchers suggested that a comprehensive patch only emerged four versions after an initial partial fix, this is disputed by Spark Development Network, which developed the application. “They changed the details of their description of the issue several months after their initial communication” to “include other attack vectors”, but a patch was nevertheless issued promptly, Jon Edmiston, developer at the non-profit organization, told The Daily Swig. The researchers posted a detailed account of their findings on the Full Disclosure security mailing list on January 2.Account takeoverThe other ‘critical’ bug in Rock RMS (CVE-2019-18642) could see attackers tamper with user IDs after they are sent to the server following profile updates made by low privileged users, and then “make changes to any other user”.This means they could change the system administrator’s email address, perform a password reset, then login and achieve full application compromise.Both flaws were assigned a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.8.However, Edmiston said these classifications were inaccurate. “While we treat every security concern very seriously, they are very much overstating the impact of some of these items,” he said.RECOMMENDED Swig Security Review 2020 – Part IA third, medium severity flaw (CVSS 5.3) in the GetVCard functionality “allowed any unauthenticated user to loop through all sequential user ID’s and exfiltrate user’s personal information”, such as “first name, last name, phone numbers, email address, [and] physical address.” (CVE-2019-18641).Security researchers also found several unsecured API calls, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw, and information leakage arising from a problem with private calendar access.Disputed patch processThe researchers alerted Spark Development Network to the file upload, API tag, and GetVCard flaws on January 9, 2020, then reported the account takeover bug on January 16.Version 8.6 landed three days later, on January 19, although researchers told the maintainers on March 7 that this had only partially fixed the file upload restriction bypass.“Again here they are alluding to a report they made that they then changed after we had fixed their reported bug,” said Jon Edmiston of Spark Development Network. “They widened the description.”He added: “We in fact fixed and released [comprehensive] patches within days for all of their items.”Read more of the latest open source software security newsThe latest versions, 8.10 and 9.4 respectively, were released on November 5 and November 6.The researchers have advised users to trawl their content directory for potentially malicious file extensions such as .aspx, and web logs for file uploads to directories other than the content directory, as well as “for suspicious iterations looping through objects such as vcard IDs”.“All in all we feel we did an excellent job in dealing with these reported issued”, especially given comparatively modest resources, said Edmiston.“We responded very quickly to their communications,” he added, saying that the researchers had “praised our responsiveness. “I even setup a call with them to ensure we understood each item.” The Daily Swig has contacted the security researchers for further comment and will update the article if and when we hear back. This article was updated on January 5 with comments from Spark Development Network.

no,Microsoft downplays threat after admitting SolarWinds attackers accessed source code,Software blueprints acquired but not altered,"The SolarWinds hackers accessed portions of Microsoft’s source code, the software giant admitted last week.The latest results of an ongoing investigation by Microsoft revealed that the sophisticated attackers behind the SolarWindscyber-espionage operation were able to use compromised accounts to access the blueprints of Microsoft’s software.The recently detected supply chain attack affecting enterprise assets tools management firm SolarWinds has sent shock waves through the industry.SolarWinds’ Orion software is used to manage servers at a diverse range of organizations including various arms of the US government, threat response firm FireEye, and Microsoft. Updates to the software were used to distribute malware.The attacks – which may have begun as early as March but were only detected last month – have been linked to Russian state-sponsored cyber-espionage gang APT29 (AKA Cozy Bear).Unusual activityThe breach failed to result in the far more serious outcome of any changes to its source code, a statement by Microsoft issued late last week explains:We detected unusual activity with a small number of internal accounts and upon review, we discovered one account had been used to view source code in a number of source code repositories.The account did not have permissions to modify any code or engineering systems and our investigation further confirmed no changes were made.These accounts were investigated and remediated.Microsoft previously admitted that although it was affected by the industry wide SolarWinds attack, its investigations had found “no evidence of access to production services or customer data”.RELATED Microsoft falls prey to SolarWinds supply chain cyber-attackersRedmond is sticking to that line and says that it has “found no indications that our systems were used to attack others”, contrary to reports by Reuters.The software giant previously said that it had detected malicious SolarWinds applications in its environment, which it isolated and removed.Further investigations of the common tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to the abuse of forged Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens associated with the SolarWinds attacks.Fanning the flamesMicrosoft went on to say that because its security culture is mature, it put no reliance on “security by obscurity”. As a result, the possibility that attackers had access to its source code was said to pose no particular heightened threat.“At Microsoft, we have an inner source approach – the use of open source software development best practices and an open source-like culture – to making source code viewable within Microsoft,” it said.“This means we do not rely on the secrecy of source code for the security of products, and our threat models assume that attackers have knowledge of source code.
